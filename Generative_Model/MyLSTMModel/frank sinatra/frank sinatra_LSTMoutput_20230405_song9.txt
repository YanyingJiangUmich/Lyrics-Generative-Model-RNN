Under the neon lights, weftern like wishous my lover

and then you racher any or our lift aggain and again.
so time another stormy dreams what pettatser spet.

ug an allain, what over adachaning
when the word os felppiposy where merest arm muching and charmased
i believe in yeal, i looked, the frouh with mether
