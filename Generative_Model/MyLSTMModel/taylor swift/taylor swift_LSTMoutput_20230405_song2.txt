On a starry night, shink
and it was brogh on the books,
fee starlight dancing in my ham
when it was parting here

'cause we're you there an a recele

siven i couldn't block agying it my desows
and there's nothing when i ferry from oh o forevarg
and i see i stores
waute up, crasie than a bad, we'll say that say it's like that's un
