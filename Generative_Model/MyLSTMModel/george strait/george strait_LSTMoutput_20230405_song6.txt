Lost in the rhythm of life,
hop i can't walk to burn
i caunt tome how who uplet twe best time the famenop
and i'm this but of live, joh, i just couldn told

ithough yus a side i con't now shi's got
every thats mexstate trying

chorus
they cold me the good are dene, in all i bigard up
i can't shoullak make a whrown
that is caw time
some time me, can heart tomes

but it listt stand to give
it took heart iss purtsase and i cat come from yous winte lost

there wores some ringle but colders

cause your hears home and bit beensous
