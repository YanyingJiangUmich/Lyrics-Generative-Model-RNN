In the shadows of skyscrapers,

standie's farm not coffee,
you tell memorews the ones that you must know
where the weagh's are youthing
when you can turn to mind your twoeland
your poet down girt.

don't even jake hown to were the girl whut it

for the read with a sighole
tighthing stupid twick as swoed
with some an hour, put my brain

of next down in jail, straigle
all of eh's face lang sold

when the sun works alwnogin
