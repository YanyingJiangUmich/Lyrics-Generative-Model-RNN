"once upon a time you dressed so fine
threw the bums a dime in your prime,
didn't you?
people call say:
'beware doll, you're bound to fall'
you thought they were all
kidding you
you used to laugh about
everybody that was hanging out
now you don't talk so loud
now you don't seem so proud
about having to be scrounging your next meal
how does it feel,
how does it feel?
to be without a home,
like a complete unknown,
like a rolling stone
ahh you've gone to the finest schools,
alright miss lonely
but you know you only used to
get juiced in it
nobody's ever taught you how to
live out on the street
and now you're gonna have to get used to it
you say you never compromise
with the mystery tramp,
but now you realize
he's not selling any alibis
as you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
and say 'do you want to make a deal?'
how does it feel,
how does it feel?
to be on your own,
with no direction home
a complete unknown,
like a rolling stone
ah you never turned around to see
the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
when they all did tricks for you
you never understood that it ain't no good
you shouldn't let other people
get your kicks for you
you used to ride on a chrome horse
with your diplomat
who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
ain't it hard when you discovered that
he really wasn't where it's at
after he took from you
everything he could steal
how does it feel,
how does it feel?
to have on your own,
with no direction home
like a complete unknown,
like a rolling stone
ahh princess on a steeple
and all the pretty people
they're all drinking,
thinking that they've got it made
exchanging all precious gifts
but you better take your diamond ring,
you better pawn it babe
you used to be so amused
at napoleon in rags
and the language that he used
go to him, he calls you,
you can't refuse
when you ain't got nothing,
you got nothing to lose
you're invisible now,
you've got no secrets to conceal
how does it feel,
ah how does it feel?
to be on your own,
with no direction home
like a complete unknown,
like a rolling stone"

"pistol shots ring out in the ballroom night
enter patty valentine from the upper hall.
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood,
cries out, ""my god, they've killed them all!""
here comes the story of the hurricane,
the man the authorities came to blame
for somethin' that he never done.
put in a prison cell, but one time he could a been
the champion of the world.
three bodies lyin' there does patty see
and another man named bello, movin' around mysteriously.
""i didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""i was only robbin' the register, i hope you understand.
i saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""one of us had better call up the cops.""
and so patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
in the hot new jersey night.
meanwhile, far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around.
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that.
in paterson that's just the way things go.
if you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'less you wanna draw the heat.
alfred bello had a partner
and he had a rap for the cops.
him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowlin' around
he said, ""i saw two men runnin' out,
they looked likemiddleweights
they jumped into a white car with out of state plates.""
and miss patty valentine just nodded her head.
cop said, ""wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men.
four in the mornin' and they haul rubin in,
take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs.
the wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
says, ""wha'd you bring him in here for? he ain't the guy!""
yes, here's the story of the hurricane,
the man the authorities came to blame
for somethin' that he never done.
put in a prison cell, but one time he could a been
the champion of the world.
four months later, the ghettos are in flame,
rubin's in south america, fightin' for his name
while arthur dexter bradley's still in the robbery game
and the cops are puttin' the screws to him,
lookin' for somebody to blame.
""remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""you think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""think it might a been that fighter
that you saw runnin' that night?""
""don't forget that you are white.""
arthur dexter bradley said, ""i'm really not sure.""
cops said, ""a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job
and we're talkin' to your friend bello
now you don't wanta have to go back to jail,
be a nice fellow.
you'll be doin' society a favor.
that sonofab**** is brave and gettin' braver.
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder on him
he ain't no gentleman jim.""
rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much.
it's my work, he'd say, and i do it for pay
and when it's over i'd just as soon go on my way
up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail.
but then they took him to the jail house
where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
all of rubin's cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pig circus, he never had a chance.
the judge made rubin's witnesses
drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched
he was a revolutionary bum
and to the black folks he was just a crazy n****.
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger.
and though they could not produce the gun,
the d.a. said he was the one who did the deed
and the all white jury agreed.
rubin carter was falsely tried.
the crime was murder ""one,"" guess who testified?
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fool's hand?
to see him obviously framed
couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
where justice is a game.
now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha in a ten foot cell
an innocent man in a living hell.
that's the story of the hurricane,
but it won't be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time he's done.
put in a prison cell, but one time he could a been
the champion of the world."
"hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.
hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
in the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.
though i know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
vanished from my hand,
left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
my weariness amazes me, i'm branded on my feet,
i have no one to meet
and the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.
hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.
hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
in the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.
take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
my senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
to be wanderin'.
i'm ready to go anywhere, i'm ready for to fade
into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
i promise to go under it.
hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.
hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
in the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.
though you might hear laughin', spinnin',
swingin' madly across the sun,
it's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
and but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
and if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
to your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
i wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
seein' that he's chasing.
hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.
hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
in the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you.
then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
the haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
with one hand waving free,
silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
with all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
let me forget about today until tomorrow.
hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to.
hey! mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,
in the jingle jangle morning i'll come followin' you."

"come you masters of war
you that build the big guns
you that build the death planes
you that build all the bombs
you that hide behind walls
you that hide behind desks
i just don't want you to know
i can see through your masks
you that never done nothin'
but build to destroy
you play with my world
like it's your little toy
you put a gun in my hand
and you hide from my eyes
and you turn and run farther
when the fast bullets fly
like judas of old
you lie and deceive
a world war can be won
you want me to believe
but i see through your eyes
and i see through your brain
like i see through the water
that runs down my drain
you fasten all the triggers
for the others to fire
then you set back and watch
when the death count gets higher
you hide in your mansion
as young people's blood
flows out of their bodies
and is buried in the mud
you've thrown the worst fear
that can ever be hurled
fear to bring children
into the world
for threatening my baby
unborn and unnamed
you ain't worth the blood
that runs in your veins
how much do i know
to talk out of turn
you might say that i'm young
you might say i'm unlearned
but there's one thing i know
though i'm younger than you
even jesus would never
forgive what you do
let me ask you one question
is your money that good
will it buy you forgiveness
do you think that it could
i think you will find
when your death takes its toll
all the money you made
will never buy back your soul
and i hope that you die
and your death'll come soon
i will follow your casket
in the pale afternoon
and i'll watch while you're lowered
down to your deathbed
and i'll stand o'er your grave
'til i'm sure that you're dead"

may you stay forever young.
may you grow up to be righteous,
may you grow up to be true,
may you always know the truth
and see the lights surrounding you.
may you always be courageous,
stand upright and be strong,
may you stay forever young,
forever young, forever young,
may you stay forever young.
may your hands always be busy,
may your feet always be swift,
may you have a strong foundation
when the winds of changes shift.
may your heart always be joyful,
may your song always be sung,
may you stay forever young,
forever young, forever young,
may you stay forever young."

but with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
bird fly high by the light of the moon,
oh, oh, oh, jokerman.
so swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
you rise up and say goodbye to no one.
fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one.
shedding off one more layer of skin,
keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
bird fly high by the light of the moon,
oh, oh, oh, jokerman.
you're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister.
you're going to sodom and gomorrah
but what do you care? ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister.
friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
you look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
bird fly high by the light of the moon,
oh, oh, oh, jokerman.
well, the book of leviticus and deuteronomy,
the law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
in the smoke of the twilight on a milk white steed,
michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
bird fly high by the light of the moon,
oh. oh. oh. jokerman.
well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain.
nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain,
false hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
only a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in.
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
bird fly high by the light of the moon,
oh, oh, oh, jokerman.
it's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
a woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
he'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
take the motherless children off the street
and place them at the feet of a harlot.
oh, jokerman, you know what he wants,
oh, jokerman, you don't show any response.
jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,
bird fly high by the light of the moon,
oh, oh, oh, jokerman."
"when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love
when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love
i know you haven't made your mind up yet
but i would never do you wrong
i've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong
i'd go hungry, i'd go black and blue
i'd go crawling down the avenue
there's nothing that i wouldn't do
to make you feel my love
the storms are raging on the rollin' sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet
i could make you happy, make your dreams come true
nothing that i wouldn't do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love"

you got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
you got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never cure your ills.
when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
you got men who can't hold their peace and women who can't control their tongues,
the rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
you got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up

spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved.
when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up

do you ever wonder just what god requires?
you think he's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires.
when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
you can't take it with you and you know that it's too worthless to be sold,
they tell you, ""time is money"" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.

"oh, where have you been, my blue eyed son?
oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
i've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
i've walked and i've crawled on six crooked highways,
i've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
i've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
i've been ten thousand miles
in the mouth of a graveyard,
and it's a hard, and it's a hard,
it's a hard, and it's a hard,
and it's a hard rain's gonna fall.
oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
i saw a newborn baby
with wild wolves all around it
i saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
i saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
i saw a room full of men
with their hammers a bleedin',
i saw a white ladder all covered with water,
i saw ten thousand talkers
whose tongues were all broken,
i saw guns and sharp swords
in the hands of young children,
and it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
and it's a hard rain's gonna fall.
and what did you hear, my blue eyed son?
and what did you hear, my darling young one?
i heard the sound of a thunder,
it roared out a warnin',
heard the roar of a wave
that could drown the whole world,
heard one hundred drummers
whose hands were a blazin',
heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
heard one person starve,
i heard many people laughin',
heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
and it's a hard, and it's a hard,
it's a hard, it's a hard,
and it's a hard rain's gonna fall.
oh, who did you meet, my blue eyed son?
who did you meet, my darling young one?
i met a young child beside a dead pony,
i met a white man
who walked a black dog,
i met a young woman whose body was burning,
i met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
i met one man who was wounded in love,
i met another man who was wounded with hatred,
and it's a hard, it's a hard,
it's a hard, it's a hard,
it's a hard rain's gonna fall.
oh, what'll you do now, my blue eyed son?
oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
i'm a goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a fallin',
i'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,
where the people are many
and their hands are all empty,
where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
where the home in the valley
meets the damp dirty prison,
where the executioner's face is always well hidden,
where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,
where black is the color, where none is the number,
and i'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,
and reflect it from the mountain
so all souls can see it,
then i'll stand on the ocean until i start sinkin',
but i'll know my song well before i start singin',
and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
it's a hard rain's gonna fall."
"i pity the poor immigrant
who wishes he would've stayed home,
who uses all his power to do evil
but in the end is always left so alone.
that man whom with his fingers cheats
and who lies with ev'ry breath,
who passionately hates his life
and likewise, fears his death.
i pity the poor immigrant
whose strength is spent in vain,
whose heaven is like ironsides,
whose tears are like rain,
who eats but is not satisfied,
who hears but does not see,
who falls in love with wealth itself
and turns his back on me.
i pity the poor immigrant
who tramples through the mud,
who fills his mouth with laughing
and who builds his town with blood,
whose visions in the final end
must shatter like the glass.
i pity the poor immigrant
when his gladness comes to pass."
"mother of muses sing for me

mother of muses sing for my heart
sing of a love too soon to depart
sing of the heroes who stood alone
whose names are engraved on tablets of stone
who struggled with pain so the world could go free
mother of muses sing for me
sing of sherman, montgomery and scottâ¬
and of zhukov, and patton, and the battles they fought
who cleared the path for presley to sing
who carved the path for martin luther king
who did what they did and they went on their way
man, i could tell their stories all day
i'm falling in love with calliope
she don't belong to anyone, why not give her to me?
she's speaking to me, speaking with her eyes
i've grown so tired of chasing lies
mother of muses, wherever you are
i've already outlived my life by far
mother of muses, unleash your wrath
things i can't see, they're blocking my path
show me your wisdom, tell me my fate
put me upright, make me walk straight
forge my identity from the inside out
you know what i'm talking about
take me to the river, release your charms
let me down a while in your sweet, loving arms
wake me, shake me, free me from sin
make me invisible, like the wind
got a mind that ramble, got a mind that roam
i'm travelin' light and i'm a slow coming home"

thunder from the barrel of his gun.

down in some tularosa alley,

billy, you're so far away from home.
there's always some new stranger sneakin' glances
some trigger happy fool willin' to take chances
and some old whore from san pedro to make advances
advances on your spirit and your soul.
the businessmen from taos want you to go down
they've hired pat garrett to force a showdown.
billy, don't it make ya feel so low down
to be shot down by the man who was your friend?
hang on to your woman if you got one
remember in el paso, once, you shot one.
she may have been a whore, but she was a hot one

"one by one, they followed the sun,
one by one, until there were none.
two by two, to their lovers they flew,
two by two, into the foggy dew.
three by three, they danced on the sea,
four by four, they danced on the shore,
five by five, they tried to survive,
six by six, they were playing with tricks.

how many paths did they try and fail?
how many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
how much poison did they inhale?
how many black cats crossed their trail?
seven by seven, they headed for heaven,
eight by eight, they got to the gate,
nine by nine, they drank the wine,
ten by ten, they drank again.
bridge #2:
how many tomorrow's have are they given away?
how many compared to yesterday?
how many more without any reward?
how many more can they afford?
two by two, they stepped into the ark,
two by two, they step in the dark.
three by three, they're turning the key,
four by four, they turn it some more,
one by one, they follow the sun,
two by two, to another rendezvous."

you didn't come home till the sun was shining bright
ow, boy, i just can't take my rest
ow, boy, i just can't take my rest
with this 32 20 laying up and down my breast"
"when she said,
""don't waste your words, they're just lies,""
i cried she was deaf.
and she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,
then said, ""what else you got left?""
it was then that i got up to leave
but she said, ""don't forget,
everybody must give something back
for something they get.""
i stood there and hummed,
i tapped on her drum and asked her how come.
and she buttoned her boot,
and straightened her suit,
then she said, ""don't get cute.""
so i forced my hands in my pockets
and felt with my thumbs,
and gallantly handed her
my very last piece of gum.
she threw me outside,
i stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.
and after finding i'd
forgotten my shirt,
i went back and knocked.
i waited in the hallway, she went to get it,
and i tried to make sense
out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
that leaned up against . .
her jamaican rum
and when she did come, i asked her for some.
she said, ""no, dear.""
i said, ""your words aren't clear,
you'd better spit out your gum.""
she screamed till her face got so red
then she fell on the floor,
and i covered her up and then
thought i'd go look through her drawer.
and, when i was through
i filled up my shoe
and brought it to you.
and you, you took me in,
you loved me then
you didn't waste time.
and i, i never took much,
i never asked for your crutch.
now don't ask for mine."
"now and then there's a fool such as i
pardon me if i'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should i cry
when you are gone, i will dream a little dream as years go by
now and then there is a fool, a fool such as i.
now and then there's a fool such as i am over you
you taught me how to love and now you happened to be untrue
i am a fool but i love you, dear, yes i will until the day i die.
now and then there is a fool, a fool such as i.

you taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
i am a fool, yes, but i love you dear, i will love you dear
till the day, till the day i die

"how many times have you heard someone say,
""if i had his money, i could do things my way.""
but little they know that it's so hard to find
one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
once i was winning in fortune and fame;
everything that i dreamed of to get a start in lifes game.
but suddenly it happened, i lost every dime,
but i'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
money can't buy back your youth when you're old
or a friend when you're lonesome or a love that's grown cold;
the wealthiest person is a pauper at times
compared to the man with a satisfied mind.
when life is over, my time has run out,
my friends and my loved ones i'll leave, there's no doubt.
but one thing for certain, when it comes my time,
i'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind."
"i can hear the turning of the key
i've been deceived by the clown inside of me.
i thought that he was righteous but he's vain
oh, something's a telling me i wear the ball and chain.
my patron saint is a fighting with a ghost
he's always off somewhere when i need him most.
the spanish moon is rising on the hill
but my heart is a tellin' me i love ya still.
i come back to the town from the flaming moon
i see you in the streets, i begin to swoon.
i love to see you dress before the mirror
won't you let me in your room one time 'fore i finally disappear?
everybody's wearing a disguise
to hide what they've got left behind their eyes.
but me, i can't cover what i am
wherever the children go i'll follow them.
i march in the parade of liberty
but as long as i love you i'm not free.
how long must i suffer such abuse
won't you let me see you smile one time before i turn you loose?
i've given up the game, i've got to leave,
the pot of gold is only make believe.
the treasure can't be found by men who search
whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
we sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
i asked ya please to cross me off a your list.
my head tells me it's time to make a change
but my heart is telling me i love ya but you're strange.
one more time at midnight, near the wall
take off your heavy make up and your shawl.
won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
let me feel your love one more time before i abandon it."

"as i walked out tonight in the mystic garden
the wounded flowers were dangling from the vine
i was passing by yon cool crystal fountain
someone hit me from behind
ain't talkin', just walkin'
through this weary world of woe
heart burnin', still yearnin'
no one on earth would ever know
they say prayer has the power to heal
so pray for me mother
in the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
i am a tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others
but oh, mother, things ain't going well
ain't talkin', just walkin'
i'll burn that bridge before you can cross
heart burnin', still yearnin'
there'll be no mercy for you once you've lost
now i'm all worn down by weeping
my eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
if i catch my opponents ever sleeping
i'll just slaughter 'em where they lie
ain't talkin', just walkin'
through the world mysterious and vague
heart burnin', still yearnin'
walkin' through the cities of the plague.
well, the whole world is filled with speculation
the whole wide world which people say is round
they will tear your mind away from contemplation
they will jump on your misfortune when you're down
ain't talkin', just walkin'
eatin' hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.
heart burnin', still yearnin'
some day you'll be glad to have me around.
they will crush you with wealth and power
every waking moment you could crack
i'll make the most of one last extra hour
i'll revenge my father's death then i'll step back
ain't talkin', just walkin'
hand me down my walkin' cane.
heart burnin', still yearnin'
got to get you out of my miserable brain.
all my loyal and my much loved companions
they approve of me and share my code
i practice a faith that's been long abandoned
ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road
ain't talkin', just walkin'
my mule is sick, my horse is blind.
heart burnin', still yearnin'
thinkin' 'bout that gal i left behind.
well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'
fame and honor never seem to fade
the fire gone out but the light is never dyin'
who says i can't get heavenly aid?
ain't talkin', just walkin'
carryin' a dead man's shield
heart burnin', still yearnin'
walkin' with a toothache in my heel
the sufferin' is unending
every nook and cranny has its tears
i'm not playing, i'm not pretending
i'm not nursin' any superfluous fears
ain't talkin', just walkin'
walkin' ever since the other night.
heart burnin', still yearnin'
walkin' 'til i'm clean out of sight.
as i walked out in the mystic garden
on a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
excuse me, ma'am, i beg your pardon
there's no one here, the gardener is gone
ain't talkin', just walkin'
up the road, around the bend.
heart burnin', still yearnin'
in the last outback at the world's end."

"all or nothing at all
half a love, never appealed to me

no i'd rather have nothing at all

don't smile or i'll be lost beyond recall
the kiss in your eyes, and the touch of your hand
makes me weak
and my heart may go dizzy and fall

"well, it's always been my nature to take chances
my right hand drawing back while my left hand advances

his eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud
with a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
and the head of a hyena

if you can read my mind, why must i speak?
no, i have heard nothing about the man that you seek

in the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
the peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
i was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
with your subpoena

i've tried my best to love you, but i cannot play this game
your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same

your servants are half dead; you're down to the bone
tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown
maybe down in jerusalem or argentina?
she was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
he's surrounded by god's angels and she's wearin' a blindfold
and so are you, angelina
oh, angelina. oh, angelina
i see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force
i can see the unknown rider, i can see the pale white horse
in god's truth tell me what you want, and you'll have it of course
just step into the arena
beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
begging god for mercy and weepin' in unholy places

annie's going to sing her song

depends on how long she's been gone

she knows the damn thing never fails

she sings it when she goes away

"1. oh, me and my cousin, one arthur mcbride,
as we went a walkin' down by the seaside,
mark now what followed and what did betide,
for it bein' on christmas mornin'
now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,
and we met sergeant napper and corporal vamp
and a little wee drummer intending to camp,
for the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.
2. ""good morning, good morning,"" the sergeant he cried.
""and the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply,
intending no harm but meant to pass by,
for it bein' on christmas mornin'
""but,"" says he, ""my fine fellows, if you will enlist,
ten guineas in gold i'll stick to your fist,
and a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,
and drink the king's health in the morning.
3. ""for a soldier, he leads a very fine life,
and he always is blessed with a charming young wife,
and he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,
and he always lives pleasant and charmin',
and a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
in the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.
while other poor fellows go dirty and mean,
and sup on thin gruel in the morning.""
instrumental
4. ""but,"" says arthur, ""i wouldn't be proud of your clothes,
for you've only the lend of them, as i suppose,
but you dare not change them one night, for you know
if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,
and although that we're single and free,
we take great delight in our own company,
we have no desire strange places to see,
although that your offers are charming.
5. ""and we have no desire to take your advance,
all hazards and dangers we barter on chance,
for you'd have no scruples for to send us to france,
where we would get shot without warning,""
""oh no,"" says the sergeant. ""i'll have no such chat,
and neither will i take it from snappy young brats,
for if you insult me with one other word,
i'll cut off your heads in the morning.""
6. and arthur and i, we soon drew our hogs,
and we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
when a trusty shillelagh came over their head
and bid them take that as fair warning.
and their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
we flung them as far as we could in the tide,
""now take them up, devils!"" cried arthur mcbride,
""and temper their edge in the mornin'!""
7. and the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,
and we made a football of his rowdy dow dow,
threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,
and bade it a tedious returning,
and we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.
we paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
and we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,
and left them for dead in the morning.
8. and so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
we obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,
for we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
and bid them look sharp in the mornin'.

"as i went out one morning
to breathe the air around tom paine's,
i spied the fairest damsel
that ever did walk in chains.
i offer'd her my hand,
she took me by the arm.
i knew that very instant,
she meant to do me harm.
""depart from me this moment,""
i told her with my voice.
said she, ""but i don't wish to,""
said i, ""but you have no choice.""
""i beg you, sir,"" she pleaded
from the corners of her mouth,
""i will secretly accept you
and together we'll fly south.""
just then tom paine, himself,
came running from across the field,
shouting at this lovely girl
and commanding her to yield.
and as she was letting go her grip,
up tom paine did run,
""i'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me,
""i'm sorry for what she's done."""

"i once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.
with the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
i courted her proudly but now she is gone,
gone as the season she's taken.
through young summer's breeze, i stole her away
from her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
of the two sisters, i loved the young.
with sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
the constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
by the jealousy of others around her.
for her parasite sister, i had no respect,
bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.
countless visions of the other she'd reflect
as a crutch for her scenes and her society.
myself, for what i did, i cannot be excused,
the changes i was going through can't even be used,
for the lies that i told her in hopes not to lose
the could be dream lover of my lifetime.
with unknown consciousness, i possessed in my grip
a magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
noticing not that i'd already slipped
to a sin of love's false security.
from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,
till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""please,
what's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""
and so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
the timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
at the peak of the night, the king and the queen
tumbled all down into pieces.
""the tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,
""leave her alone, god damn you, get out!""
and i in my armor, turning about
and nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.
beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
her sister and i in a screaming battleground.
and she in between, the victim of sound,
soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.
all is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.
i gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.
my mind it was mangled, i ran into the night
leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
the wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.
the words to say i'm sorry, i haven't found yet.
i think of her often and hope whoever she's met
will be fully aware of how precious she is.
ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
""how good, how good does it feel to be free?""
and i answer them most mysteriously,
""are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"""
"you walk into the room
with your pencil in your hand
you see somebody naked
and you say, ""who is that man?""

""it's his""

you hand in your ticket
and you go watch the geek
who immediately walks up to you
when he hears you speak
and says, ""how does it feel
to be such a freak?""
and you say, ""impossible""
as he hands you a bone
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is

you have many contacts
among the lumberjacks
to get you facts
when someone attacks your imagination
but nobody has any respect

to just give a check
to tax deductible charity organizations
you've been with the professors
and they've all liked your looks
with great lawyers you have
discussed lepers and crooks
you've been through all of
f. scott fitzgerald's books
you're very well read
it's well known
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
and then he kneels
he crosses himself
and then he clicks his high heels
and without further notice
he asks you how it feels
and he says, ""here is your throat back
thanks for the loan""
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
now you see this one eyed midget
shouting the word ""now""
and you say, ""for what reason?""
and he says, ""how?""
and you say, ""what does this mean?""
and he screams back, ""you're a cow
give me some milk
or else go home""
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
well, you walk into the room
like a camel and then you frown
you put your eyes in your pocket
and your nose on the ground
there ought to be a law
against you comin' around
you should be made
to wear earphones
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?"

"a tongue can accuse or carry bad news
the seeds of destruction it will sow
so unless you have made no mistakes in your life
be careful of stones that you throw
my neighbor was passin' my garden one time
she smiled and i knew right away
that it was gossip not flowers that she had on her mind
and this is what i heard my neighbor say
""that bad girl down the street
she should be run from our midst
she drinks and she talks quite a lot
she knows not to speak to my child nor to me. ""

be careful of stones that you throw

a sound that made my blood chill

hadn't been pulled from the path
and saved by a girl i love still
her child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
""oh, who was that brave girl so sweet? ""
i covered the crushed broken body and said
""that bad girl down the street. ""

the fair fields all alone
down by the banks of loch eiron
where beauty and pleasure were known.
i spied a fair maid at her labour
which caused me to stay for a while
and i thought of a goddess to beauty
bloomin' bright star of bright isle.
i humbled myself to her beauty
""fair maiden, where do you belong ?
are you from heaven descended
abiding in cupid's fair throne ?"".
""young man, i will tell you a secret
it's true i'm a maid that is poor
and to part from my vows and my promise
is more than my heart can endure.
therefore i remain at my service
and go through all my hardship and toil
and wait for the lad that has left me
all alone on the banks of belle isle"".
""young maiden i wish not to banter
it's true i come here in disguise
i came here to fulfill our last promise
and hope to give you a surprise.
i've known you're a maid i love dearly

for me there is no other damsel
than my bloomin' bright star of belle isle""."

in blood the hand began to write
and belshezaar couldn't hide his fright
he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his kingdom was divided, it could not stand
he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his houses were built upon the sand
well, no one around could understand
just what was written by this mystic hand
belshezaar tried, he couldn't find
a man who could give him some peace of mind
daniel, the prophet, a man of god
he saw the writing on the wall in blood
belshezaar asked him what it said
and daniel turned to the wall and read
you are weighed in the balance and found wanting
your kingdom is divided, it cannot stand
you are weighed in the balance and found wanting
your houses are built upon the sand"
"bessie was more than just a friend of mine
we shared the good times with the bad
now many a year has passed me by
i still recall the best thing i ever had
i'm just goin' down the road t' see bessie
oh, see her soon
goin' down the road t' see bessie smith
when i get there i wonder what she'll do
now all the crazy things i had to try
well i tried them all and then some
but if you're lucky one day you find out
where it is you're really comin' from
i'm just goin' down the road t' see bessie
oh, see her soon
goin' down the road t' see bessie smith
when i get there i wonder what she'll do
now in my day i've made some foolish moves
but back then, i didn't worry 'bout a thing
and now again i still wonder to myself
was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing
i'm just goin' down the road t' see bessie
oh, see her soon
goin' down the road t' see bessie smith
when i get there i wonder what she'll do
there's so much time has gone right on by
i didn't think one could be so wrong
and then one night i was drinkin' and a thinkin'
in the bottom of the glass i could see bessie's face so strong
i'm just goin' down the road t' see bessie
oh, see her soon
goin' down the road t' see bessie smith
when i get there i wonder what she'll do
when she sees me will she know what i've been through?
will old times start to feelin' like new?
when i get there will our love still feel so true?
yet all i have, i'll be a bringin' it to you
oh bessie, sing them old time blues"
"oh well, i love you pretty baby
you're the only love i've ever know
just as long as you stay with me
the whole world is my throw
beyond here lies nothing
nothing we can call our own
well, i'm moving after midnight
down boulevards of broken cars
don't know what i do without it
without this love we call ours
beyond here lies nothing
nothing but the moon and stars
down every street there's a window
and every window made of glass
will keep on loving pretty baby
for as long as love will last
beyond here lies nothing
but the mountains of the past
well, my ship is in the harbor
and the sails are spread
listen to me pretty baby
lay your hand upon my head
beyond here lies nothing
nothing done and nothing said"
"beyond the horizon, behind the sun
at the end of the rainbow life has only begun
in the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above
beyond the horizon it is easy to love
i'm touched with desire
what don't i do?
through flame and through fire
i'll build my world around you
beyond the horizon, in the springtime or fall
love waits forever, for one and for all
beyond the horizon, across the divide
'round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
down in the valley the water runs cold
beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul
my wretched heart is pounding
i felt an angel's kiss
my memories are drowning
in mortal bliss
beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
every step that you take, i'm walking the same
beyond the horizon, the night winds blow
the theme of a melody from many moons ago
the bells of st. mary, how sweetly they chime
beyond the horizon i found you just in time
it's dark and it's dreary
i've been pleading in vain
i'm wounded, i'm weary
my repentance is plain
beyond the horizon o'r the treacherous sea
i still can't believe that you have set aside your love for me
beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
in the soft light of morning i'll follow you with my eyes
through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
beyond the horizon right down to the bone
it's the right time of the season
somebody there always cared
there's always a reason
why someone's life has been spared
beyond the horizon, the sky is so blue
i've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you"
"now i taught the weeping willow how to cry
and i showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
and the tears that i cried for that woman
are gonna flood you big river
then i'm gonna sit right here until i die
i met her accidentally in st. paul and it tore me up every time i heard her drawl, southern drawl
then i heard my dream was back
downstream cavortin' in davenport
and i followed you, big river, when you called
then you took me to st. louis later on a freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
i found her trail in memphis, but she just walked up the block
she raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone
now, won't you batter down by baton rouge, river queen, roll it on
take that woman on down to new orleans, new orleans
go on, i've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
she loves you, big river, more than me
now i taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
and i showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
and the tears that i cried for that woman are gonna flood you big river
then i'm gonna sit right here until i die"

they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them

"up on the white veranda
she wears a necktie and a panama hat.
her passport shows a face
from another time and place
she looks nothin' like that.
and all the remnants of her recent past
are scattered in the wild wind.
she walks across the marble floor
where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.
she smiles, walks the other way
as the last ship sails and the moon fades away
from black diamond bay.
as the mornin' light breaks open, the greek comes down
and he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.
""pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,
carefully removes his fez,
""am i hearin' you right?""
and as the yellow fog is liftin'
the greek is quickly headin' for the second floor.
she passes him on the spiral staircase
thinkin' he's the soviet ambassador,
she starts to speak, but he walks away
as the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
on black diamond bay.
a soldier sits beneath the fan
doin' business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.
lightning strikes, the lights blow out.
the desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,
""can you see anything?""
then the greek appears on the second floor
in his bare feet with a rope around his neck,
while a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,
says, ""open up another deck.""
but the dealer says, ""attendez vous, s'il vous plait,''
as the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
from black diamond bay.
the desk clerk heard the woman laugh
as he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.
he tried to grab the woman's hand,
said, ""here's a ring, it cost a grand.""
she said, ""that ain't enough.""
then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
while a horse drawn taxi waited at the curb.
she passed the door that the greek had locked,
where a handwritten sign read, ""do not disturb.""
she knocked upon it anyway
as the sun went down and the music did play
on black diamond bay.
""i've got to talk to someone quick!""
but the greek said, ""go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.
he hung there from the chandelier.
she cried, ""help, there's danger near
please open up the door!""
then the volcano erupted
and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.
the soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
thinking of forbidden love.
but the desk clerk said, ""it happens every day,""
as the stars fell down and the fields burned away
on black diamond bay.
as the island slowly sank
the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
the dealer said, ""it's too late now.
you can take your money, but i don't know how
you'll spend it in the tomb.""
the tiny man bit the soldier's ear
as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
while she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,
""my darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""
she sheds a tear and then begins to pray
as the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
from black diamond bay.
i was sittin' home alone one night in l.a.,
watchin' old cronkite on the seven o'clock news.
it seems there was an earthquake that
left nothin' but a panama hat
and a pair of old greek shoes.
didn't seem like much was happenin',
so i turned it off and went to grab another beer.
seems like every time you turn around
there's another hard luck story that you're gonna hear
and there's really nothin' anyone can say
and i never did plan to go anyway
to black diamond bay."
"black rider, black rider, you've been living too hard
been up all night, have to stay on your guard
the path that you're walking, too narrow to walk
every step of the way, another stumbling block
the road that you're on
same road that you know
just not the same as it was a minute ago
black rider, black rider, you've seen it all
you've seen the great world and you've seen the small
you fell into the fire and you're eating the flame
better seal up your lips if you wanna stay in the game
be reasonable, mister, be honest, be fair
let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer
black rider, black rider, all dressed in black
i'm walking away, you try to make me look back
my heart is at rest, i'd like to keep it that way
i don't wanna fight, at least not today
go home to your wife, stop visiting mine
one of these days i'll forget to be kind
black rider, black rider
tell me when, tell me how
if there ever was a time, then let it be now
let me go through, open the door
my soul is distressed, my mind is at war
don't hug me, don't flatter me, don't turn on the charm
i'll take a sword and hack off your arm
black rider, black rider, hold it right there
the size of your cock will get you nowhere
i'll suffer in silence, i'll not make a sound
maybe i'll take the high moral ground
some enchanted evening i'll sing you a song
black rider, black rider
you've been on the job too long"

"seen the arrow on the doorpost
saying: ""this land is condemned
all the way from new orleans
to jerusalem""
i traveled through east texas
where many martyrs fell
and i know no one can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell
well, i heard the hoot owl singing
as they were taking down the tents
the stars above the barren trees
were his only audience
them charcoal gypsy maidens
can strut their feathers well
but nobody can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell
see them big plantations burning
hear the cracking of the whips
smell that sweet magnolia blooming
 see the ghosts of slavery ships
i can hear them tribes a moaning
 hear the undertaker's bell
 , nobody can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell
there's a woman by the river
with some fine young handsome man
he's dressed up like a squire
bootlegged whiskey in his hand
there's a chain gang on the highway
i can hear them rebels yell
and i know no one can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell
well, god is in heaven
and we all want what's his
but power and greed and corruptible seed
seem to be all that there is
i'm gazing out the window
of the st. james hotel
and i know no one can sing the blues
like blind willie mctell"

"blue moon, you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.
blue moon, you knew just what i was there for
you heard me saying a prayet for someone i really could care for.
and suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
i heard someone whisper, ""please, adore me""
and when i looked my moon had turned to gold.
blue moon, now i'm no longer alone
without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
without a love of my own."
"i was riding on the mayflower
when i thought i spied some land
i yelled for captain arab
i have yuh understand
who came running to the deck
said, ""boys, forget the whale
look on over yonder
cut the engines
change the sail
haul on the bowline""
we sang that melody
like all tough sailors do
when they are far away at sea
""i think i'll call it america""
i said as we hit land
i took a deep breath
i fell down, i could not stand
captain arab he started
writing up some deeds
he said, ""let's set up a fort
and start buying the place with beads""
just then this cop comes down the street
crazy as a loon
he throw us all in jail
for carryin' harpoons
ah me i busted out
don't even ask me how
i went to get some help
i walked by a guernsey cow
who directed me down
to the bowery slums
where people carried signs around
saying, ""ban the bums""
i jumped right into line
sayin', ""i hope that i'm not late""
when i realized i hadn't eaten
for five days straight
i went into a restaurant
lookin' for the cook
i told them i was the editor
of a famous etiquette book
the waitress he was handsome
he wore a powder blue cape
i ordered some suzette, i said
""could you please make that crepe""
just then the whole kitchen exploded
from boilin' fat
food was flying everywhere
and i left without my hat
now, i didn't mean to be nosy
but i went into a bank
to get some bail for arab
and all the boys back in the tank
they asked me for some collateral
and i pulled down my pants
they threw me in the alley
when up comes this girl from france
who invited me to her house
i went, but she had a friend
who knocked me out
and robbed my boots
and i was on the street again
well, i rapped upon a house
with the u.s. flag upon display
i said, ""could you help me out
i got some friends down the way""
the man says, ""get out of here
i'll tear you limb from limb""
i said, ""you know they refused jesus, too""
he said, ""you're not him
get out of here before i break your bones
i ain't your pop""
i decided to have him arrested
and i went looking for a cop
i ran right outside
and i hopped inside a cab
i went out the other door
this englishman said, ""fab""
as he saw me leap a hot dog stand
and a chariot that stood
parked across from a building
advertising brotherhood
i ran right through the front door
like a hobo sailor does
but it was just a funeral parlor
and the man asked me who i was
i repeated that my friends
were all in jail, with a sigh
he gave me his card
he said, ""call me if they die""
i shook his hand and said goodbye
ran out to the street
when a bowling ball came down the road
and knocked me off my feet
a pay phone was ringing
it just about blew my mind
when i picked it up and said hello
this foot came through the line
well, by this time i was fed up
at tryin' to make a stab
at bringin' back any help
for my friends and captain arab
i decided to nip a coin
like either heads or tails
would let me know if i should go
back to ship or back to jail
so i hocked my sailor suit
and i got a coin to flip
it came up tails
it rhymed with sails
so i made it back to the ship
well, i got back and took
the parkin' ticket off the mast
i was ripping it to shreds
when this coastguard boat went past
they asked me my name
and i said, ""captain kidd""
they believed me but
they wanted to know
what exactly that i did
i said for the pope of eruke
i was employed
they let me go right away
they were very paranoid
well, the last i heard of arab
he was stuck on a whale
that was married to the deputy
sheriff of the jail
but the funniest thing was
when i was leavin' the bay
i saw three ships a sailin'
they were all heading my way
i asked the captain what his name was
and how come he didn't drive a truck
he said his name was columbus
i just said, ""good luck."""
"well, the lone ranger and tonto

see no sports car run
i don't have no sports car
and i don't even care to have one

and my boots on my feet
watch out so you don't step on me
well, lookit here buddy
you want to be like me
pull out your six shooter
and rob every bank you can see
tell the judge i said it was all right
yes!"
"while riding on a train goin' west,
i fell asleep for to take my rest.
i dreamed a dream that made me sad,
concerning myself and the first few friends i had.
with half damp eyes i stared to the room
where my friends and i spent many an afternoon,
where we together weathered many a storm,
laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.
by the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
our words were told, our songs were sung,
where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied
talkin' and a jokin' about the world outside.
with haunted hearts through the heat and cold,
we never thought we could ever get old.
we thought we could sit forever in fun
but our chances really was a million to one.
as easy it was to tell black from white,
it was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
and our choices were few and the thought never hit
that the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.
how many a year has passed and gone,
and many a gamble has been lost and won,
and many a road taken by many a friend,
and each one i've never seen again.
i wish, i wish, i wish in vain,
that we could sit simply in that room again.
ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
i'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that."
"oh, i'm sailin' away my own true love,
i'm sailin' away in the morning.
is there something i can send you from across the sea,
from the place that i'll be landing?
no, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love,
there's nothin' i wish to be ownin'.
just carry yourself back to me unspoiled,
from across that lonesome ocean.
oh, but i just thought you might want something fine
made of silver or of golden,
either from the mountains of madrid
or from the coast of barcelona.
oh, but if i had the stars from the darkest night
and the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
i'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss,
for that's all i'm wishin' to be ownin'.
that i might be gone a long time
and it's only that i'm askin',
is there something i can send you to remember me by,
to make your time more easy passin'.
oh, how can, how can you ask me again,
it only brings me sorrow.
the same thing i want from you today,
i would want again tomorrow.
i got a letter on a lonesome day,
it was from her ship a sailin',
saying i don't know when i'll be comin' back again,
it depends on how i'm a feelin'.
well, if you, my love, must think that a way,
i'm sure your mind is roamin'.
i'm sure your heart is not with me,
but with the country to where you're goin'.
so take heed, take heed of the western wind,
take heed of the stormy weather.
and yes, there's something you can send back to me,
spanish boots of spanish leather."
"in the lonely night
in the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
you're comin' thru to me in black and white
when we were made of dreams.
you're blowing down the shaky street,
you're hearing my heart beat
in the record breaking heat
where we were born in time.
bridge #1:
not one more night, not one more kiss,
not this time baby, no more of this,
takes too much skill, takes too much will,
it's revealing.
you came, you saw, just like the law
you married young, just like your ma,
you tried and tried, you made me slide
you left me reelin' with this feelin'.
on the rising curve
where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
you won't get anything you don't deserve
where we were born in time.
bridge #2:
you pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
you hang the flame, you'll pay the price,
oh babe, that fire
is still smokin'.
you were snow, you were rain
you were striped, you were plain,
oh babe, truer words
have not been spoken or broken.
in the hills of mystery,
in the foggy web of destiny,
you can have what's left of me,
where we were born in time."
"one, two, a one two threeÃ¢â¬Â¦

i walk alone through the shakin' street,
iÃ¢â¬â¢m a listenin' to my heart beat
in the record breaking heat
where we were born in time.
not one more night, not one more kiss,
not this time, i'll have no more of this.
it's much too cruel, it's much too cool, way too revealing.
you came, you saw, just like the law
you married young, just like your ma,
oh babe, how you left me reelin' with this feelin'.
up on the rising curve
where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
i held you close and got what i deserve
where we were born in time.
you pressed me once, pressed me twice,
you hang the flame, but you'll pay the price.
oh babe, and that fire is still smokin'.
you were snow, you were rain
you were striped, lord and you were plain,
oh babe, truer words have never been spoken or broken.
in the hills of mystery,
in the foggy web of destiny,
you can have what's left of me,
where we were born in time."

"well, there was this movie i seen one time,
about a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred gregory peck.
he was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
the townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
as the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath.
turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square,
i want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death.
well, i keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a rolling in
and you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
you know i can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart.
the memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train.
i can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
in your busted down ford and your platform heels
i could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
ah, but you were right. it was perfect as i got in behind the wheel.
well, we drove that car all night into san anton'
and we slept near the alamo, your skin was so tender and soft.
way down in mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
i would have gone on after you but i didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
well, we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the rockies,
now i know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul.
but i'm too over the edge and i ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times when i was your only man
and she don't want to remind me. she knows this car would go out of control.
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl, show me all around the world, brownsville girl, you're my honey love.
well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards amarillo
we pulled up where henry porter used to live. he owned a wreckin' lot outside of town about a mile.
ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. she saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
she said, ""henry ain't here but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while.""
then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of bummin' a ride back to where she started.
but ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up.
she said, ""welcome to the land of the living dead."" you could tell she was so broken hearted.
she said, ""even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt.""
""how far are y'all going?"" ruby asked us with a sigh.
""we're going all the way 'til the wheels fall off and burn,
'til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies.""
ruby just smiled and said, ""ah, you know some babies never learn.""
something about that movie though, well i just can't get it out of my head
but i can't remember why i was in it or what part i was supposed to play.
all i remember about it was gregory peck and the way people moved
and a lot of them seemed to be lookin' my way.
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl, show me all around the world, brownsville girl, you're my honey love.
well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour.
i was crossin' the street when shots rang out.
i didn't know whether to duck or to run, so i ran.
""we got him cornered in the churchyard,"" i heard somebody shout.
well, you saw my picture in the corpus christi tribune. underneath it, it said, ""a man with no alibi.""
you went out on a limb to testify for me, you said i was with you.
then when i saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
it was the best acting i saw anybody do.
now i've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
oh if there's an original thought out there, i could use it right now.
you know, i feel pretty good, but that ain't sayin' much. i could feel a whole lot better,
if you were just here by my side to show me how.
well, i'm standin' in line in the rain to see a movie starring gregory peck,
yeah, but you know it's not the one that i had in mind.
he's got a new one out now, i don't even know what it's about
but i'll see him in anything so i'll stand in line.
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl, show me all around the world, brownsville girl, you're my honey love.
you know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
the only thing we knew for sure about henry porter is that his name wasn't henry porter.
and you know there was somethin' about you baby that i liked that was always too good for this world
just like you always said there was something about me you liked that i left behind in the french quarter.
strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content.
i don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when i'm gone.
you always said people don't do what they believe in, they just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
and i always said, ""hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on.""
there was a movie i seen one time, i think i sat through it twice.
i don't remember who i was or where i was bound.
all i remember about it was it starred gregory peck, he wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
brownsville girl with your brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
brownsville girl, show me all around the world, brownsville girl, you're my honey love."

"he sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
preoccupied with his vengeance
cursing the dead that can't answer him back
i'm sure that he has no intentions
of looking your way, unless it's to say
that he needs you to test his inventions.
can you please crawl out your window?
use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
how can you say he will haunt you?
you can go back to him any time you want to.
he looks so truthful, is this how he feels
trying to peel the moon and expose it
with his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
if he needs a third eye he just grows it
he just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
or pick it up after he throws it.
can you please crawl out your window?
use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
how can you say he will haunt you?
you can go back to him any time you want to.
why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
are you frightened of the box you keep him in
while his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
their religion of the little ten women
that backs up their views but your face is so bruised
come on out the dark is beginning.
can you please crawl out your window?
use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
how can you say he will haunt you?

"oh the evening train is rolling
all along the homeward way
all my hopes are over the horizon
all my dreams have gone away
the hillside darkly shaded
stars fall from above
all the joys of earth have faded
the night's untouched by love
i'll be here 'til tomorrow
beneath a shroud of grey
i pretend i'm free of sorrow
my heart is miles away
the dead bells are ringing
my train is overdue
to your memory i'm clinging
i can't escape from you
well i hear the sound of thunder
roaring loud and long
sometimes you've got to wonder
god knows i've done no wrong
you've wasted all your power
you threw out the christmas pie
now you're withering like a flower
you'll play the fool and die
i'm neither sad nor sorry
i'm all dressed up in black
i fought for fame and glory
you tried to break my back
in the far off sweet forever
the sunshine peeking through
we should have walked together
i can't escape from you
i cannot grasp the shadows
that gather near the door
rain falls round my window
i wish i'd seen you more
the path is ever winding
the stars they never age
the morning light is blinding
all the world's a stage
should be the time of gladness
happy faces everywhere
the mystery of madness
is propagating in the air
i don't like the city
not like some folks do
isn't it a pity
i can't escape from you
we ploughed the fields of heaven
right down to the end
i hope i can be forgiven
if any words of mine offend
all our days were splendid
they were simple, they were plain
it never should have ended
i should have kissed you in the rain
i've been thinking things all over
all the moments full of grace
the primrose and the clover
your ever changing face
can't help looking at you
you made love with god knows who
never found a girl to match you
i can't escape from you"

but i can't help falling in love with you
shall i stay, will it be a sin

take my hand, take my whole life too
for i can't help falling in love with you."

it's late; i'm trying to walk the line
well it's way past midnight and there are people all around
some on their way up, some on their way down
the air burns and i'm trying to think straight
and i don't know how much longer i can wait
i'm your man; i'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
you understand that my heart can't go on beating without you
well, your loveliness has wounded me, i'm reeling from the blow
i wish i knew what it was keeps me loving you so
i'm breathing hard, standing at the gate
but i don't know how much longer i can wait
skies are grey, i'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
night or day, it doesn't matter where i go anymore; i just go
if i ever saw you coming i don't know what i would do
i'd like to think i could control myself, but it isn't true
that's how it is when things disintegrate
and i don't know how much longer i can wait
i'm doomed to love you, i've been rolling through stormy weather
i'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together
it's mighty funny; the end of time has just begun
oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one
while i'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
i left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
i thought somehow that i would be spared this fate
but i don't know how much longer i can wait."
"1. well, it's all of fair and handsome girl,
she's all in her tender years.
she fell in love with a sailor boy,
it's true she loved him well.
for to go off to sea with him
like she did not know how,
she longed to see that seaport town
of canadee i o.
2. so she bargained with the sailor boy,
all for a piece of gold.
straightaway then he led her
down into the hold,
sayin', ""i'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,
your jacket shall be blue.
you'll see that seaport town
of canadee i o.
3. now, when the other sailors heard the news,
well, they fell into a rage,
and with all the ship's company
they were willing to engage.
saying, ""we'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,
overboard we'll throw her.
she'll never see that seaport town
called canadee i o.
4. now, when the captain he heard the news,
well, he too fell in a rage,
and with the whole ship's company
he was willing to engage,
sayin', ""she'll stay in sailor's clothes,
her color shall be blue,
she'll see that seaport town
call canadee i o.
5. now, when they come down to canada
scarcely 'bout half a year,
she's married this bold captain
who called her his dear.
she's dressed in silks and satins now,
she cuts a gallant show,
finest of the ladies
down canadee i o.
6. come, all you fair and tender girls,
wheresoever you may be,
i'd have you to follow your own true love
whene'er he goes to sea.
for if the sailors prove false to you,
well, the captain, he might prove true.
you'll see the honor i have gained
by the wearing of the blue."

by a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.

from one to another she could to easily switch
we went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.
could i been used and played as a pawn?
it certainly was possible as the g** night wore on
where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.

fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
she looked into my soul through the clothes that i wore
she said, ""we got a mutual friend over by the door,
and you know he's got our best interest in mind.""
he was well connected but her heart was a snare
and she had left him to die in there,
there were payments due and he was a little behind.
the cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
street band playing ""nearer my god to thee.""
we met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,
she said, ""i know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
you can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""

but it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
every new messenger brings evil report
'bout armies on the march and time that is short
and famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.
would i have married her? i don't know, i suppose.
she had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
but i kept hearing my name and i had to be movin' on.
i saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,
i saw a house in the country being torn from within.
i heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.

with the stitches still mending 'neath a heart shaped tattoo.
renegade priests and treacherous young witches
were handing out the flowers that i'd given to you.

where dog soldiers are reflected,
the endless road and the wailing of chimes,
the empty rooms where her memory is protected,
where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.

as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
an' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
with faces hidden while the walls were tightening
as the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
dissolved into the bells of the lightning
tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked
tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
the sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
that the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
an' the unpawned painter behind his rightful time
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
in the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
for the disrobed faceless forms of no position
tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
all down in taken for granted situations
tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
for the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
even though a cloud's white curtain in a far off corner flashed
an' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
for the lonesome hearted lovers with too personal a tale
an' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
starry eyed an' laughing as i recall when we were caught
trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
as we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
for the countless confused, accused, misused, strung out ones an' worse
an' for every hung up person in the whole wide universe
an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing."

that's what they did
they said what's up is down, they said what isn't is
they put ideas in his head he thought were his
he was a clean cut kid
but they made a killer out of him,
that's what they did
he was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
when he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand
he was a clean cut kid
but they made a killer out of him,
that's what they did
he went to church on sunday, he was a boy scout
for his friends he would turn his pockets inside out
he was a clean cut kid
but they made a killer out of him,
that's what they did
they said, ""listen boy, you're just a pup""
they sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
they gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
a jeep to drive, blood to spill
they said ""congratulations, you got what it takes""
they sent him back into the rat race without any brakes
he was a clean cut kid
but they made a killer out of him,
that's what they did
he bought the american dream but it put him in debt
the only game he could play was russian roulette
he drank coca cola, he was eating wonder bread,
ate burger kings, he was well fed
he went to hollywood to see peter o'toole
he stole a rolls royce and drove it in a swimming pool
they took a clean cut kid
and they made a killer out of him,
that's what they did
he could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
could've been an accountant or a tennis star
he was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
off the golden gate bridge into china bay
his mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
they gotta sleep together in a home they don't own
they took a clean cut kid
and they made a killer out of him,
that's what they did
well, everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust
all he ever wanted was somebody to trust
they took his head and turned it inside out
he never did know what it was all about
he had a steady job, he joined the choir
he never did plan to walk the high wire
they took a clean cut kid
and they made a killer out of him,
that's what they did"
"after a while we took in the clothes,
nobody said very much.
just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants
which nobody really wanted to touch.
mama come in and picked up a book
an' papa asked her what it was.
someone else asked, ""what do you care?""
papa said, ""well, just because.""
then they started to take back their clothes,
hang 'em on the line.
it was january the thirtieth
and everybody was feelin' fine.
the next day everybody got up
seein' if the clothes were dry.
the dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,
mama, of course, she said, ""hi!""
""have you heard the news?"" he said, with a grin,
""the vice president's gone mad!""
""where?"" ""downtown."" ""when?"" ""last night.""
""hmm, say, that's too bad!""
""well, there's nothin' we can do about it,"" said the neighbor,
""it's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget.""
""yes, i guess so,"" said ma,
then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.
i reached up, touched my shirt,
and the neighbor said, ""are those clothes yours?""
i said, ""some of 'em, not all of 'em.""
he said, ""ya always help out around here with the chores?""
i said, ""sometime, not all the time.""
then my neighbor, he blew his nose
just as papa yelled outside,
""mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes.""
well, i just do what i'm told,
so, i did it, of course.
i went back in the house and mama met me
and then i shut all the doors."
"everytime my baby and me go up town

"come all ye fair and tender ladies
be careful how you court young men
they're like a star on a summer's morning
they'll first appear and then they're gone
they'll tell you some loving story
they'll declare to you their love is true
then they will go and court some other
and that's the love they have for you
do you remember our days of courting
when your head lay upon my breast
you could make me believe with falling of your arm
that the sun rose in the west
i wish i was a little sparrow
and i had wings with which to fly
right over to see my false true lover
and when he's talking i'd be nigh
but i'm not a little sparrow
i have no wings with which to fly
so i sit here in grief and sorrow
to weep and pass my troubles by
if i had known before i courted
that love was such a killing thing
i'd a locked my heart in a box of golden
and fastened it up with a silver pin"

come rain or come shine
high as a mountain, deep as a river

it was just one of those things

'cause i'm gonna be true if you let me
you're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me
come rain or come shine
happy together, unhappy together

we're in or we're out of the money

""tonight we pray for water
cool, clear water. ""
and way up there he'll hear our prayer
and show us where there's water
cool, clear water
keep a movin', dan, don't you listen to him, dan
he's a devil not a man
and he spreads the burning sand with water
dan, can you see that big green tree
where the water's running free
and it's waiting there for you and me
cool, clear water
dan's feet are sore, he's yearning for
just one thing more than water
cool, clear water

where there's no quest for water

"get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,

don't use no green or rotten wood; they'll get you by the smoke.
we'll just lay there by the juniper... etc.

"i cross the green mountain
i sit by the stream
heaven blazing in my head i
i dreamt a monsterous dream
something came up
out of the sea
swept through the land of
the rich and the free
i look into the eyes
of my merciful friend
and then i ask myself
is this the end?
memories linger
sad yet sweet
and i think of the souls in heaven who will be
alters are burning
the flames far and wide
the fool has crossed over
from the other side
they tip their caps
from the top of the hill
you can feel them come
all brave blood do spill
along the dim
atlantic line
the rapper's land
lasts for miles behind
the lights coming foreward
and the streets are broad
all must yield
to the avenging god
the world is old
the world is great
lessons of life
can't be learned in a day
i watch and i wait
and i listen while i stand
to the music that comes
from a far better land
close the eyes
of our captain
peace may he know
his long night is done
the great leader is laid low
he was ready to fall
he was quick to defend
killed outright he was
by his own men
it's the last day's last hour
of the last happy year
i feel that the unknown
the world is so dear
pride will vanish
and glory will rot
but virtue lives
and cannot be forgot
the bells
of evening have rung
there's blasphemy
on the end of the tongue
let them say that i walked
in fair nature's light
and that i was loyal
to truth and to right
serve god and meet your full
look upward beyond
beyond the darkness that masks
the surprises of dawn
in the deep green grasses
and the blood stained woods
they never dreamed of surrendering
they fell where they stood
stars fell over alabama
and i saw each star
you're walking in dreams
whoever you are
chilled as the skies
keen as the frost
and the ground's froze hard
and the morning is lost
a letter to mother
came today
gunshot wound to the breast
is what it did say
but he'll be better soon
he's in a hospital bed
but he'll never be better
he's already dead
i'm ten miles outside the city
and i'm lifted away
in an ancient light
that is not of day
they were calm they were gloomed
we knew them all too well
we loved eachother more than
we ever dared to tell"
"i crossed the rubicon on the 14th day
of the most dangerous month of the year
at the worst time, at the worst place
that's all i seem to hear
i got up early
so i can greet the goddess of the dawn
i've painted my wagon, abandoned all hope
and i crossed the rubicon
well, the rubicon is a red river
goin' gently as she flows
redder than your ruby lips
and the blood that flows from the rose
three miles north of purgatory
one step from the great beyond
i prayed to the cross, i kissed the girls
and i crossed the rubicon
what are these dark days i see?
in this world so badly bent
i cannot redeem the time
the time so idly spent
how much longer can it last?
how long can it go on?
i embrace my love
put down my hair
and i crossed the rubicon
i can feel the bones beneath my skin
and they're tremblin' with rage
i'll make your wife a widow
you'll never see old age
show me one good man in sight
that the sun shines down upon
i pawned my watch, i paid my debts
and i crossed the rubicon
put my hide up on a hill
where some happiness i'll find
if i survive, then let me love
let the hour be mine
take the high road, take the low
take any one you're on
i poured a cup, i passed it along
and i crossed the rubicon
well, you defiled the most lovely flowers
in all her womanhood
others can be tolerant
others can be good
i'll cut you up with a the crooked knife
lord, i'll miss you when you're gone
i stood between heaven and earth
and i crossed the rubicon
you won't find any happiness here
no happiness or joy
go back to the gutter, try your luck
find you some nice pretty boy
tell me how many men i need
and who can i count upon
i strapped my belt, i buttoned my coat
and i crossed the rubicon
i feel the holy spirit inside
see the light that freedom gives
i believe it's in the reach of
every man who lives
keep as far away as possible
it's darkest 'fore the dawn i turned the key, i broke it off
and i crossed the rubicon
mornin' baby, i used to look my mind
i truly believe that you are
couldn't be anybody else but you
who's come with me this far
the killing frost is on the ground
and the autumn leaves are gone
i lit the torch, looked to the east
and i crossed the rubicon"

nasty, dirty, double crossin', back stabbin' phony i didn't have to, want to have to deal with

well, i cried for you, now it's your turn to cry awhile
i don't carry dead weight, i'm no flash in the pan
all right, i'll set you straight, can't you see i'm a union man
i'm lettin' the cat out of the cage, i'm keepin' a low profile
well, i cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile
feel like a fightin' rooster, feel better than i ever felt
but the pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the denver road is a goin' to melt
i went to the church house, every day i go an extra mile
well, i cry for you, now your turn, you can cry awhile
last night, 'cross the alley, there was a poundin' on the wall
it must have been don pasquale makin' a 2 a.m. booty call
to break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
well, i cried for you, now it's your turn to cry awhile
i'm on the fringes of the night fighting back my tears i can't control
some people they ain't human, they ain't got no heart or soul
but i'm a cryin' to the lord, tryin' to be meek and mild
yes, i cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile
well the preacher's in the pulpit and the babies in their cribs
i'm longin' for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
i'm goin' t' buy me a barrel of whisky, i'll die before i turn senile
yes, i cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile?
well, you bet on the horses, they ran the wrong way
i always said you'd be sorry and that would be the day
i might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial
well, i cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile"
"oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside,
they're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide.
i live in another world where life and death are memorized,
where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all i see are dark eyes.
a cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer,
some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere.
but i can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise,
whom nature's beast fears as they come and all i see are dark eyes.
they tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes,
they tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, i'm sure it is.
but i feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized,
all i feel is heat and flame and all i see are dark eyes.
oh, the french girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel,
hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel.
oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies,
a million faces at my feet but all i see are dark eyes."
"oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
the birdies were flying from tree to tree.

yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
i glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
i was ready to leave, i was already walkin',
but the next time i looked there was light in the room.
and the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill,
yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin',
the weather was hot, a nearly 90 degrees.
the man standin' next to me, his head was exploding,
well, i was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me.
yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance,
yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
and the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
i put down my robe, picked up my diploma,
took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive,
straight for the hills, the black hills of dakota,
sure was glad to get out of there alive.
and the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.

my burden is heavy,
my dreams are beyond control.

i'm gonna give you all i got to give,
and i do hope you receive it well,
dependin' on the way you feel that you live.
dear landlord,
please heed these words that i speak.
i know you've suffered much,
but in this you are not so unique.
all of us, at times, we might work too hard
to have it too fast and too much,

just remember that death is not the end

just remember that death is not the end

just remember that death is not the end

not the end, not the end
just remember that death is not the end

and the bright light of salvation shines
in dark and empty skies

delia's daddy weeped, delia's momma moaned,
wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
all the friends i ever had are gone.
curtis' looking high, curtis' looking low,
he shot poor delia down with a cruel forty four.
all the friends i ever had are gone.
high up on the housetops, high as i can see,
looking for them rounders, looking out for me.
all the friends i ever had are gone.
men in atlanta, tryin' to pass for white,
delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.
all the friends i ever had are gone.
judge says to curtis, ""what's this noise about?""
""all about them rounders, judge, tryin' to cut me out.""
all the friends i ever had are gone.
curtis said to the judge, ""what might be my fine?""
judge says, ""poor boy, you got ninety nine.""
all the friends i ever had are gone.
curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup,
delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up.
all the friends i ever had are gone.
delia, oh delia, how can it be?
you loved all them rounders, never did love me.
all the friends i ever had are gone.
delia, oh delia, how can it be?
you wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
all the friends i ever had are gone."
"they're selling postcards of the hanging
they're painting the passports brown
the beauty parlor is filled with sailors
the circus is in town
here comes the blind commissioner
they've got him in a trance
one hand is tied to the tight rope walker
the other is in his pants
and the riot squad they're restless
they need somewhere to go
as lady and i look out tonight
from desolation row
cinderella, she seems so easy
""it takes one to know one,"" she smiles
and puts her hands in her back pockets
bette davis style
and in comes romeo, he's moaning
""you belong to me i believe""
and someone says,"" you're in the wrong place, my friend
you better leave""
and the only sound that's left
after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweeping up
on desolation row
now the moon is almost hidden
the stars are beginning to hide
the fortunetelling lady
has even taken all her things inside
all except for cain and abel
and the hunchback of notre dame
everybody is making love
or else expecting rain
and the good samaritan, he's dressing
he's getting ready for the show
he's going to the carnival tonight
on desolation row
now ophelia, she's 'neath the window
for her i feel so afraid
on her twenty second birthday
she already is an old maid
to her, death is quite romantic
she wears an iron vest
her profession's her religion
her sin is her lifelessness
and though her eyes are fixed upon
noah's great rainbow
she spends her time peeking
into desolation row
einstein, disguised as robin hood
with his memories in a trunk
passed this way an hour ago
with his friend, a jealous monk
he looked so immaculately frightful
as he bummed a cigarette
then he went off sniffing drainpipes
and reciting the alphabet
now you would not think to look at him
but he was famous long ago
for playing the electric violin
on desolation row
dr. filth, he keeps his world
inside of a leather cup
but all his sexless patients
they're trying to blow it up
now his nurse, some local loser
she's in charge of the cyanide hole
and she also keeps the cards that read
""have mercy on his soul""
they all play on penny whistles
you can hear them blow
if you lean your head out far enough
from desolation row
across the street they've nailed the curtains
they're getting ready for the feast
the phantom of the opera
a perfect image of a priest
they're spoonfeeding casanova
to get him to feel more assured
then they'll kill him with self confidence
after poisoning him with words
and the phantom's shouting to skinny girls
""get outa here if you don't know
casanova is just being punished for going
to desolation row""
now at midnight all the agents
and the superhuman crew
come out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
then they bring them to the factory
where the heart attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene
is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that nobody is escaping
to desolation row
praise be to nero's neptune
the titanic sails at dawn
and everybody's shouting
""which side are you on?""
and ezra pound and t. s. eliot
fighting in the captain's tower
while calypso singers laugh at them
and fishermen hold flowers
between the windows of the sea
where lovely mermaids flow
and nobody has to think too much
about desolation row
yes, i received your letter yesterday
when you asked how i was doing
was that some kind of joke?
all these people that you mention
yes, i know them, they're quite lame
i had to rearrange their faces
and give them all another name
right now i can't read too good
don't send me no more letters no
not unless you mail them
from desolation row"
"1. now there's a man you'll hear about
most anywhere you go,
and his holdings are in texas
and his name is diamond joe.
2. and he carries all his money
in a diamond studded jar.
he never took much trouble
with the process of the law.
3. i hired out to diamond joe, boys,
did offer him my hand,
he gave a string of horses
so old they could not stand.
4. and i nearly starved to death, boys,
he did mistreat me so,
and i never saved a dollar
in the pay of diamond joe.
5. now his bread it was corn dodger
and his meat you couldn't chaw,
nearly drove me crazy
with the waggin' of his jaw.
6. and the tellin' of his story,
mean to let you know
that there never was a rounder
that could lie like diamond joe.
instrumental
7. now, i tried three times to quit him,
but he did argue so
i'm still punchin' cattle
in the pay of diamond joe.
8. and when i'm called up yonder
and it's my time to go,
give my blankets to my buddies
give the fleas to diamond joe."
"fat man lookin' in a blade of steel
thin man lookin' at his last meal
hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
for dignity
wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
young man lookin' in the shadows that pass
poor man lookin' through painted glass
for dignity
somebody got murdered on new year's eve
somebody said dignity was the first to leave
i went into the city, went into the town
went into the land of the midnight sun
searchin' high, searchin' low
searchin' everywhere i know
askin' the cops wherever i go
have you seen dignity?
blind man breakin' out of a trance
puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
hopin' to find one circumstance
of dignity
i went to the wedding of mary lou
she said Ã¨Â¥â don't want nobody see me talkin' to you?br> said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
about dignity
i went down where the vultures feed
i would've got deeper, but there wasn't any need
heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
wasn't any difference to me
chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
house on fire, debts unpaid
gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
have you seen dignity?
drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
in a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
lookin' into the lost forgotten years
for dignity
met prince phillip at the home of the blues
said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
he wanted money up front, said he was abused
by dignity
footprints runnin' cross the sliver sand
steps goin' down into tattoo land
i met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
in the bordertowns of despair
got no place to fade, got no coat
i'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
about dignity
sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
and into every masterpiece of literature
for dignity
englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
bites the bullet and he looks within
for dignity
someone showed me a picture and i just laughed
dignity never been photographed
i went into the red, went into the black
into the valley of dry bone dreams
so many roads, so much at stake
so many dead ends, i'm at the edge of the lake
sometimes i wonder what it's gonna take
to find dignity"
"i hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed
you were just a painted face on a trip down suicide road.
the stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
i hate myself for lovin' you and i'm glad the curtain fell.
i hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
and the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
i went out on lower broadway and i felt that place within,
that hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,
acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.
like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,
all for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
there are those who worship loneliness, i'm not one of them,
in this age of fiberglass i'm searching for a gem.
the crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
i've paid the price of solitude, but at least i'm out of debt.
can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
'cept pat me on the back one time when i was on my knees.
we stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,
no use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?
so sing your praise of progress and of the doom machine,
the naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
lady luck, who shines on me, will tell you where i'm at,
i hate myself for lovin' you, but i should get over that."
"gon' walk down that dirt road, 'til someone lets me ride
gon' walk down that dirt road, 'til someone lets me ride
if i can't find my baby, i'm gonna run away and hide
i been pacing around the room hoping maybe she'd come back
pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back
well, i been praying for salvation laying 'round in a one room country shack
gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
'til there's nothing left to see, 'til the chains have been shattered and i've been freed
i been lookin' at my shadow, i been watching the colors up above
lookin' at my shadow watching the colors up above
rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love
gon' walk on down that dirt road 'til i'm right beside the sun
gon' walk on down until i'm right beside the sun
i'm gonna have to put up a barrier to keep myself away from everyone."

"the light
in this place
is really bad
like being
in the bottom
of a stream
any minute now
i'm expecting
to wake up
from a dream
miss so much
the softest touch
like the grave
of some child child
who neither wept
nor smiled
i'm hiding my faith
in the rain
i've been
dreamin' of you
that's all i do
and it's
driving me insane
somewhere dawn
is breaking
light is streaking
across the floor
church bells
are ringing
i wonder who
they're ringing for
travel under any star
you'll see me
wherever you are
the shadowy past
is so vague and so vast
i'm sleeping
in the balance of pain
i've been dreamin' of you
that's all i do
but it's
driving me insane
maybe they'll get me
maybe they won't
but whatever
it won't be tonight
i wish your hand
was in mine right now
we could go
where the moon is wide
for years
they had me
locked in a cage
then they threw me
onto the stage
somethings
just last longer
then you
thought they would
and they never
ever explain
i'm dreamin' of you
that's all i do
and it's
driving me insane
well
i eat when i'm hungry
drink when i'm dry
live my life
on the square
even if the flesh
falls off my face
it won't matter as long
as you're there
feel like
a ghost in love
underneath
the heavens above
feel further away
then i ever did before
feel further
than i can take
dreamin' of you
that's all i do
but it's
driving me insane
everything in the way
is so shy like the day
in queer and unusual form
spirals of golden haze here
in there in a blaze
like beams of light
in a star
maybe you're here
or maybe you weren't
maybe you
touched somebody
and got burned
the silent sun
has got me on the run
burning a hole
in my brain
i'm dreamin' of you
that's all i do
but it's
driving me insane"

as they carried him from the courtroom

""my trip hasn't been a pleasant one
and my time it isn't long,
and i still do not know
what it was that i've done wrong.""
well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,
a tear came to his eye,
""you fail to understand,"" he said,
""why must you even try?""
outside, the crowd was stirring,
you could hear it from the door.
inside, the judge was stepping down,
while the jury cried for more.
""oh, stop that cursed jury,""
cried the attendant and the nurse,
""the trial was bad enough,
but this is ten times worse.""
just then a bolt of lightning
struck the courthouse out of shape,
and while ev'rybody knelt to pray
the drifter did escape."
"i didn't know that you'd be leavin'

never needed to call you my whore.
i always thought you were straight, baby,

driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore
well these times and these tunnels are haunted,
the bottom of the barrel is too.
i waited years sometimes for what i wanted.
everybody can't be as lucky as you.

why you don't never play with me any more.
at any moment you could go under,

driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore
driftin' too far from shore

i give you all of what i could provide
we weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
we were the wrong side.

with a dollar in my hand

in the early mornin' rain
and no place to go
out on runway number nine
big seven o seven set to go
well, i'm stuck here on the ground
where the cold winds blow
the liquor tasted good
and the women all were fast
there she goes, my friend
she's a rollin' down at last
here the mighty engines roar
see the silver bird on high
she's away in westward bound
far above the clouds she'll fly
where the mornin' rain don't fall
and the sun always shines
she'll be flyin' over my home
in about three hours time
this old airports got me down
it's no earthly good to me
'cause i'm stuck here on the ground
cold and drunk as i might be
you can't hop a jet plane
like you can a freight train
so i best be on my way
in the early mornin' rain

"all the early roman kings
in their shark skin suits
bow ties and buttons
high top boots
drivin' the spikes in
blazin' the rails
nailed in their coffins
top hats and tails
fly away over
fly away flap your wings
fly by night
like the early roman kings
they're peddlers and they're meddlers
they buy and they sell
they destroyed your city
they'll destroy you as well
they're lecherous and treacherous
a hell bent for leather
each of 'em bigger
than all men put together
sluggers and muggers
wearin' fancy gold rings
all the women going crazy
for the early roman kings"
"come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where i once begun.
come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
i could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors.
but i will always be emotionally yours.
come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart.
come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start.
i could be dreaming but i keep believing you're the one i'm livin' for.
and i will always be emotionally yours.
it's like my whole life never happened,
when i see you, it's as if i never had a thought.
i know this dream, it might be crazy,
but it's the only one i've got.
come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, i would be satisfied.
come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
i could be unraveling wherever i'm traveling, even to foreign shores.
but i will always be emotionally yours."
"j. r. robertson
take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket,
never let it slip away.
always be a man, not a boy gone astray.
when ya get half cra zy from the august heat
or on a frozen, rotted road
with no one to complain to about your achin' feet.
chorus:
you're gonna walk that endless highway,
walk that high way till you die.
all you children goin' my way,
better tell your home life sweet goodbye.
when i see a detour up ahead,
well, i leave it far behind,
who knows what you're apt to find there.
with the cost of livin, and the price of dyin',
well it look like t'me this time i wont be buyin'
chorus
when they get a scapegoat by the throat,
it's hard labour and cold beans.
if ya get away real quick,
you'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine.
well, i sing by night, wander by day.
i'm on the road and it looks like i'm here to stay.
chorus"
"i sang the song slowly
as she stood in the shadows
she stepped to the light
as my silver strings spun
she called with her eyes
to the tune i's a playin'
but the song it was long
and i'd only begun
through a bullet of light
her face was reflectin'
the fast fading words
that rolled from my tongue
with a long distance look
her eyes was on fire
but the song it was long
and there was more to be sung.
my eyes danced a circle
across her clear outline
with her head tilted sideways
she called me again
as the tune drifted out
she breathed hard through the echo
but the song it was long
and it was far to the end
i glanced at my guitar
and played it pretendin'
that of all the eyes out there
i could see none
as her thoughts pounded hard
like the pierce of an arrow
but the song it was long
and it had to get done
as the tune finally folded
i laid down the guitar
then looked for the girl
who'd stayed for so long
but her shadow was missin'
for all of my searchin'
so i picked up my guitar
and began the next song"
"the eastern world it is explodin',
violence flarin', bullets loadin',
you're old enough to kill but not for votin',
you don't believe in war, what's that gun you're totin',
and even the jordan river has bodies floatin',
but you tell me over and over and over again my friend,
ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
don't you understand, what i'm trying to say?
can't you see the fear that i'm feeling today?
if the button is pushed, there's no running away,
there'll be no one to save with the world in a grave,
take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy,
and you tell me over and over and over again my friend,
ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin',
i'm sittin' here, just contemplatin',
i can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation,
handful of senators don't pass legislation,
and marches alone can't bring integration,
when human respect is disintegratin',
this whole crazy world is just too frustratin',
and you tell me over and over and over again my friend,
ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
think of all the hate there is in red china!
then take a look around to selma, alabama!
ah, you may leave here, for four days in space,
but when your return, it's the same old place,
the poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace,
you can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace,
hate your next door neighbour, but don't forget to say grace,
and you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend,
you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction."
"in the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
when the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
there's a dyin' voice within me reaching out somewhere,
toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
like cain, i now behold this chain of events that i must break.
in the fury of the moment i can see the master's hand
in every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.
the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
to ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
i gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
and every time i pass that way i always hear my name.
then onward in my journey i come to understand
that every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
i have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
in the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
in the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
in the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
i hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
sometimes i turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
i am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand."
"they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good
they'll stone you just like they said they would
they'll stone you when you're trying to go home
they'll stone you when you're there all alone
but i would not feel so all alone
everybody must get stoned
they'll stone you when you're walking on the street
they'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat
they'll stone you when your walking on the floor
they'll stone you when your walking to the door
but i would not feel so all alone
everybody must get stoned
they'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
they'll stone you when you are young and able
they'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck
they'll stone you and then they'll say good luck
but i would not feel so all alone
everybody must get stoned
well they'll stone you and say that it's the end
they'll stone you and then they'll come back again
they'll stone you when you're riding in your car
they'll stone you when you're playing you guitar
yes but i would not feel so all alone
everybody must get stoned
alright
well they'll stone you when you are all alone
they'll stone you when you are walking home
they'll stone you and then say they're all brave
they'll stone you when you're send down in your grave
but i would not feel so all alone
everybody must get stoned

"broken lines, broken strings,
broken threads, broken springs,
broken idols, broken heads,
people sleeping in broken beds.
ain't no use jiving
ain't no use joking
everything is broken.
broken bottles, broken plates,
broken switches, broken gates,
broken dishes, broken parts,
streets are filled with broken hearts.
broken words never meant to be spoken,
everything is broken.
bridge: seem like every time you stop and turn around
something else just hit the ground
broken cutters, broken saws,
broken buckles, broken laws,
broken bodies, broken bones,
broken voices on broken phones.
take a deep breath, feel like you're chokin',
everything is broken.
bridge: every time you leave and go off someplace
things fall to pieces in my face
broken hands on broken ploughs,
broken treaties, broken vows,
broken pipes, broken tools,
people bending broken rules.
hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
everything is broken."
"another day that don't end
another ship goin' out
another day of anger, bitterness, and doubt
i know how it happened
i saw it begin
i opened my heart to the world and the world came in
hello mary lou
hello miss pearl
my fleet footed guides from the underworld
no stars in the sky shine brighter than you
you girls mean business and i do too
well i'm the enemy of treason
enemy of strife
enemy of the unlived meaningless life
i ain't no false prophet
i just know what i know
i go where only the lonely can go
i'm first among equals
second to none
last of the best
you can bury the rest
bury 'em naked with their silver and gold
put them six feet under and pray for their souls
what are you lookin' at
there's nothing to see
just a cool breeze that's encircling me
let's go for a walk in the garden
so far and so wide
we can sit in the shade by the fountain side
i search the world over
for the holy grail
i sing songs of love
i sing songs of betrayal
don't care what i drink
don't care what i eat
i climbed the mountains of swords on my bare feet
you don't know me darlin'
you never would guess
i'm nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
i ain't no false prophet
i just said what i said
i'm just here to bring vengeance on somebody's head
put out your hand
there's nothing to hold
open your mouth
i'll stuff it with gold
oh you poor devil look up if you will
the city of god is there on the hill
hello stranger
a long goodbye
you ruled the land
but so do i
you lost your mule
you got a poison brain
i'll marry you to a ball and chain
you know darlin'
the kind of life that i live
when your smile meets my smile something's got to give
i ain't no false prophet
no i'm nobody's bride
can't remember when i was born
and i forgot when i died"
"farewell angelina
the bells of the crown
are being stolen by bandits
i must follow the sound
the triangle tingles
and the trumpet play slow
farewell angelina
the sky is on fire
and i must go.
there's no need for anger
there's no need for blame
there's nothing to prove
ev'rything's still the same
just a table standing empty
by the edge of the sea
farewell angelina
the sky is trembling
and i must leave.
the jacks and queens
have forsaked the courtyard
fifty two gypsies
now file past the guards
in the space where the deuce
and the ace once ran wild
farewell angelina
the sky is folding
i'll see you in a while.
see the cross eyed pirates sitting
perched in the sun
shooting tin cans
with a sawed off shotgun
and the neighbors they clap
and they cheer with each blast
farewell angelina
the sky's changing color
and i must leave fast.
king kong, little elves
on the rooftoops they dance
valentino type tangos
while the make up man's hands
shut the eyes of the dead
not to embarrass anyone
farewell angelina
the sky is embarrassed
and i must be gone.
the machine guns are roaring
the puppets heave rocks
the fiends nail time bombs
to the hands of the clocks
call me any name you like
i will never deny it
farewell angelina
the sky is erupting
i must go where it's quiet."
"father of night, father of day,
father, who taketh the darkness away,
father, who teacheth the bird to fly,
builder of rainbows up in the sky,
father of loneliness and pain,
father of love and father of rain.
father of day, father of night,
father of black, father of white,
father, who build the mountain so high,
who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
father of time, father of dreams,
father, who turneth the rivers and streams.
father of grain, father of wheat,
father of cold and father of heat,
father of air and father of trees,
who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
father of minutes, father of days,
father of whom we most solemnly praise."

"words and music by bob dylan
down over the window
from the dazzling sunlit place
through the back alleys, through the blinds
another one of the memphis days
honey bees are buzzing
leaves begin to stir
i'm in love with my second cousin
i tell myself i could be happy forever with her
i keep listening for footsteps
but i ain't never hearing any
from the boat, i fish for bullheads
i catch a lot, sometimes too many
a summer breeze is blowin'
a squall is setting in
sometimes it's just plain stupid
to get into any kind of wind
well the old men 'round here
sometimes they get on bad terms
with the younger men,
old, young, age don't carry weight
it doesn't matter in the end
one of the boss' hangers on
sometimes comes to call
at times you least expect
tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,
inspire you with fear
it has the opposite effect
there's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
the other one is long gone
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across
burns with the bark still on
they say times are hard
if you don't believe it you can follow your nose
it don't bother me, times are hard anywhere
we'll just have to see how it goes
my old man, he's like some feudal lord
he's got more lives than a cat
i've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
things come alive or they fall flat
you can smell the pine wood burnin'
you can hear the school bell ring
got to get up near the teacher, if you can
if you wanna learn anything
romeo, he said to juliet, you got a poor complexion
that don't give your appearance a very youthful touch
juliet said back to romeo,
why don't you just shove off,
if it bothers you so much
they all got outta here any way they could
cold rain can give you the shivers
they went down the ohio, the cumberland, the tennessee,
all the rest of them rebel rivers
if you ever try to interfere with me
or cross my path again,
you do so at the peril of your life
i'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as i sound
i've seen enough heartache and strife
my grandfather was a duck trapper,
he could do it with just dragnets and ropes
my grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,
i don't know if they had any dreams or hopes
i had 'em once, though i suppose
to go along with all the ring dancing,
christmas carols and all the christmas eves
i left all my dreams and hopes
buried under tobacco leaves
not always easy kicking someone out
got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task
sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
and tears or not, it's too much to ask"
"like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
so can a woman who passes herself off as a male
they sang ""danny boy"" at his funeral and the lord's prayer
preacher talking 'bout christ betrayed
it's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
he reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
you know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up
sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down
well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
ain't no goin' back
hear ya got a brother named james, don't forget faces or names
sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
he looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
but he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
and your fall by the sword love affair with erroll flynn
in these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion
say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
ain't no goin' back
there's a retired businessman named red, cast down from heaven and he's out of his head
he feeds off of everyone that he can touch
he said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
he's not somebody that you play around with much
miss delilah is his, a philistine is what she is
she'll do wondrous works with your fate
feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed
if you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.
well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
ain't no goin' back
well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight
you'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
how to enter into the gates of paradise
no, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks
a whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
they like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
sing ""amazing grace"" all the way to the swiss banks
well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
ain't no goin' back
they got some beautiful people out there, man
they can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
they got mystery written all over their forehead
they kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
they don't believe in mercy
judgment on them is something that you'll never see
they can exalt you up or bring you down main route
turn you into anything that they want you to be
well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
ain't no goin' back
yes, i guess i loved him too
i can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill
did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
struck down by the strength of the will
ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid
from now on, this'll be where you're from
let the dead bury the dead. your time will come
let hot iron blow as he raised the shade
well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
ain't no goin' back"
"forgetful heart
lost your power of recall
every little detail
you don't remember at all
the times we knew
who would remember better then you
forgetful heart
we laughed and had a good time you and i
it's been so long
now you're content to let the days go by
when you were there
you were the answer to my prayer
forgetful heart
we loved with all the love that life can give
what can i say
without you it's so hard to live
can't take much more
why can't we love like we did before
forgetful heart
like a walking shadow in my brain
all night long
i lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
the door has closed forevermore
if indeed there ever was a door"
"four strong winds that blow lonely
seven seas that run high
all these things that won't change

and i'm bound for movin' on
i'll look for you if you ever come this way
think i'll go down to alberta
where there's good there in the fall
i've got some friends that i can go workin' for
but i wish you'd change your mind
if i ask you one more time
but we've been through that a hundred times or more

seven seas that run high

"i got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kid
but my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid
she's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread
well, if i go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
well, when the pipeline gets broken and i'm lost on the river bridge
i'm cracked up on the highway and on the water's edge
she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with thread
well, if i go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much
she walks like bo diddley and she don't need no crutch
she keeps this four ten all loaded with lead
well, if i go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
well, you know i need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead
i need a dump truck mama to unload my head
she brings me everything and more, and just like i said
well, if i go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed."
"of war and peace the truth just twists
its curfew gull just glides
upon four legged forest clouds
the cowboy angel rides
with his candle lit into the sun
though its glow is waxed in black
all except when 'neath the trees of eden
the lamppost stands with folded arms
its iron claws attached
to curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
though it shadows metal badge
all and all can only fall
with a crashing but meaningless blow
no sound ever comes from the gates of eden
the savage soldier sticks his head in sand
and then complains
unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
but still remains
upon the beach where hound dogs bay
at ships with tattooed sails
heading for the gates of eden
with a time rusted compass blade
aladdin and his lamp
sits with utopian hermit monks
side saddle on the golden calf
and on their promises of paradise
you will not hear a laugh
all except inside the gates of eden
relationships of ownership
they whisper in the wings
to those condemned to act accordingly
and wait for succeeding kings
and i try to harmonize with songs
the lonesome sparrow sings
there are no kings inside the gates of eden
the motorcycle black madonna
two wheeled gypsy queen
and her silver studded phantom cause
the gray flannel dwarf to scream
as he weeps to wicked birds of prey
who pick up on his bread crumb sins
and there are no sins inside the gates of eden
the kingdoms of experience
in the precious wind they rot
while paupers change possessions
each one wishing for what the other has got
and the princess and the prince
discuss what's real and what is not
it doesn't matter inside the gates of eden
the foreign sun, it squints upon
a bed that is never mine
as friends and other strangers
from their fates try to resign
leaving men wholly, totally free
to do anything they wish to do but die
and there are no trials inside the gates of eden
at dawn my lover comes to me
and tells me of her dreams
with no attempts to shovel the glimpse
into the ditch of what each one means
at times i think there are no words
but these to tell what's true
and there are no truths outside the gates of eden"
"you know, there's two ol' maids layin' in the bed

god knows the secrets of your heart,
he'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
god knows there's a river,

comes a roaring down the canyon to meet that salty tide
from the great pacific ocean to where the sun sets in the west,
that big grand coulee country in that land i love the best.
in the misty glitter of that wild and windward spray,
men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave.
once she tore men's boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream,
that day that grand coulee dam went across that wild and restless stream.
oh uncle sam took up the notion in the year of thirty three,
for the factory and the farmer and for all of you and me.
he said: roll it on columbia, you can roll out to the sea
but river, while you're rolling you can do some work for me.

and push back the clock for me
well my heart's in the highlands wherever i roam
that's where i'll be when i get called home
the wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme
well my heart's in the highland,
i can only get there one step at a time.
i'm listening to neil young, i gotta turn up the sound
someone's always yelling turn it down
feel like i'm drifting
drifting from scene the scene
i'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?
insanity is smashing up against my soul
you can say i was on anything but a roll
if i had a conscience, well i just might blow my top
what would i do with it anyway
maybe take it to the pawn shop
my heart's in the highlands at the break of dawn
by the beautiful lake of the black swan
big white clouds, like chariots that swing down low
well my heart's in the highlands
only place left to go
i'm in boston town, in some restaurant
i got no idea what i want
well, maybe i do but i'm just really not sure
waitress comes over
nobody in the place but me and her
it must be a holiday, there's nobody around
she studies me closely as i sit down
she got a pretty face and long white shiny legs
she says, ""what'll it be?""
i say, ""i don't know, you got any soft boiled eggs?""
she looks at me, says ""i'd bring you some
but we're out of 'm, you picked the wrong time to come""
then she says, ""i know you're an artist, draw a picture of me!""
i say, ""i would if i could, but,
i don't do sketches from memory.""
""well"", she says, ""i'm right here in front of you, or haven't you looked?""
i say,"" all right, i know, but i don't have my drawing book!""
she gives me a napkin, she says, ""you can do it on that""
i say, ""yes i could but,
i don't know where my pencil is at!""
she pulls one out from behind her ear
she says ""all right now, go ahead, draw me, i'm standing right here""
i make a few lines, and i show it for her to see
well she takes a napkin and throws it back
and says ""that don't look a thing like me!""
i said, ""oh, kind miss, it most certainly does""
she says, ""you must be jokin.'"" i say, ""i wish i was!""
then she says, ""you don't read women authors, do you?""
least that's what i think i hear her say,
""well"", i say, ""how would you know and what would it matter anyway?""
""well"", she says, ""you just don't seem like you do!""
i said, ""you're way wrong.""
she says, ""which ones have you read then?"" i say, ""i read erica jong!""
she goes away for a minute and i slide up out of my chair
i step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere
well my heart's in the highlands, with the horses and hounds
way up in the border country, far from the towns
with the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow
my heart's in the highlands
can't see any other way to go
every day is the same thing out the door
feel further away then ever before
some things in life, it gets too late to learn
well, i'm lost somewhere
i must have made a few bad turns
i see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes
they're drinking and dancing, wearing bright colored clothes
all the young men with their young women looking so good
well, i'd trade places with any of them
in a minute, if i could
i'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog
talking to myself in a monologue
i think what i need might be a full length leather coat
somebody just asked me
if i registered to vote
the sun is beginning to shine on me
but it's not like the sun that used to be
the party's over, and there's less and less to say
i got new eyes
everything looks far away
well, my heart's in the highlands at the break of day
over the hills and far away
there's a way to get there, and i'll figure it out somehow
but i'm already there in my mind
and that's good enough for now"

'cept beggin' on the street.
well, once i was rather prosperous,
there was nothing i did lack.
i had fourteen karat gold in my mouth
and silk upon my back.

to wander off in shame.

from darkness, dreams're deserted,
am i still dreamin' yet?
i wish she'd unlock
her voice once an' talk,
'stead of acting like we never have met.
if she ain't feelin' well,
then why don't she tell
'stead of turnin' her back t' my face?
without any doubt,
she seems too far out
for me t' return t' her chase.
though the night ran swirling an' whirling,
i remember her whispering yet.
but evidently she don't
an' evidently she won't,
she just acts like we never have met.
if i didn't have t' guess,
i'd gladly confess
t' anything i might've tried.
if i was with 'er too long
or have done something wrong,
i wish she'd tell me what it is, i'll run an' hide.

her mouth was watery and wet.

for she ain't the same,
she just acts like we never have met.

i'll be on my way
of this i can't say very much.
but if you want me to,
i can be just like you
an' pretend that we never have touched.

i'll say, ""it's easily done,
you just pick anyone,
an' pretend that you never have met!"""

alive as you or me,
tearing through these quarters

in a voice without restraint,
""come out, ye gifted kings and queens
and hear my sad complaint.
no martyr is among ye now

i's three fourths drunk, she looked uptight.
she took off her wheel, took off her bell,
took off her wig, said, ""how do i smell?""
i hot footed it . . bare naked . .
out the window!
well, sometimes i might get drunk,
walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.
don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride
'cause i got my little lady right by my side.
(right there
proud as can be)
i's out there paintin' on the old woodshed
when a can a black paint it fell on my head.
i went down to scrub and rub
but i had to sit in back of the tub.
(cost a quarter
and i had to get out quick . .
someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)
well, my telephone rang it would not stop,
it's president kennedy callin' me up.
he said, ""my friend, bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""
i said, ""my friend, john, brigitte bardot,
anita ekberg, sophia loren.""
well, i got a woman sleeps on a cot,
she yells and hollers and squeals a lot.
licks my face and tickles my ear,
bends me over and buys me beer.
(she's a honeymooner
a june crooner
a spoon feeder
and a natural leader)
oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,
i got a woman who works on the levee.
pumping that water up to her neck,
every week she sends me a monthly check.
(she's a humdinger
folk singer
dead ringer
for a thing a muh jigger)
late one day in the middle of the week,
eyes were closed i was half asleep.
i chased me a woman up the hill,
right in the middle of an air raid drill.
it was little bo peep!
(i jumped a fallout shelter
i jumped a bean stalk
i jumped a ferris wheel)
now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,
he's a runnin' for office on the ballot note.
he's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,
tellin' me he loves all kinds a people.
(he's eatin' bagels
he's eatin' pizza
he's eatin' chitlins
he's eatin' bullshit!)
oh, set me down on a television floor,
i'll flip the channel to number four.
out of the shower comes a grown up man
with a bottle of hair oil in his hand.
(it's that greasy kid stuff.
what i want to know, mr. football man, is
what do you do about willy mays and yul brynner,
charles de gaulle
and robert louis stevenson?)
well, the funniest woman i ever seen
was the great granddaughter of mr. clean.
she takes about fifteen baths a day,
wants me to grow a cigar on my face.
well, ask me why i'm drunk alla time,
it levels my head and eases my mind.
i just walk along and stroll and sing,
i see better days and i do better things.
(i catch dinosaurs
i make love to elizabeth taylor . .
catch hell from richard burton!)"
"i'm just average, common too
i'm just like him, the same as you
i'm everybody's brother and son
i ain't different from anyone
it ain't no use a talking to me
it's just the same as talking to you.
i was shadow boxing earlier in the day
i figured i was ready for cassius clay
i said ""fee, fie, fo, fum, cassius clay, here i come
26, 27, 28, 29, i'm gonna make your face look just like mine
five, four, three, two, one, cassius clay you'd better run
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen.""
well, i don't know, but i've been told
the streets in heaven are lined with gold
i ask you how things could get much worse
if the russians happen to get up there first.
wowee' pretty scary!
now, i'm liberal, but to a degree
i want ev'rybody to be free
but if you think that i'll let barry goldwater
move in next door and marry my daughter
you must think i'm crazy!
i wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in cuba.
well, i set my monkey on the log
and ordered him to do the dog
he wagged his tail and shook his head
and he went and did the cat instead
he's a weird monkey, very funky.
i sat with my high heeled sneakers on
waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun
i had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
and my wig hat was falling in my face
but they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
i gotta woman, she's so mean
she sticks my boots in the washing machine
sticks me with buckshot when i'm nude
puts bubblegum in my food
she's funny, wants my money, calls me ""honey.""
now i gotta friend who spends his life
stabbing my picture with a bowie knife
dreams of strangling me with a scarf
when my name comes up he pretends to barf.
i've got a million friends!
now they asked me to read a poem
at the sorority sister's home
i got knocked down and my head was swimmin'
i wound up with the dean of women
yippee! i'm a poet, and i know it.
hope i don't blow it.
i'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
so i look like a walking mountain range
and i'm gonna ride into omaha on a horse
out to the country club and the golf course.
carry the new york times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
now you're probably wondering by now
just what this song is all about
what's probably got you baffled more
is what this thing here is for.
it's nothing
it's something i learned over in england."
"they say ev'rything can be replaced,
yet ev'ry distance is not near.
so i remember ev'ry face
of ev'ry man who put me here.
i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east.
any day now, any day now,
i shall be released.
they say ev'ry man needs protection,
they say ev'ry man must fall.
yet i swear i see my reflection
some place so high above this wall.
i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east.
any day now, any day now,
i shall be released.
standing next to me in this lonely crowd,
is a man who swears he's not to blame.
all day long i hear him shout so loud,
crying out that he was framed.
i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east.
any day now, any day now,
i shall be released."
"i once held her in my arms,
she said she would always stay.
but i was cruel,
i treated her like a fool,
i threw it all away.
once i had mountains in the palm of my hand,
and rivers that ran through ev'ry day.
i must have been mad,
i never knew what i had,
until i threw it all away.
love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
love and only love, it can't be denied.
no matter what you think about it
you just won't be able to do without it.
take a tip from one who's tried.
so if you find someone that gives you all of her love,
take it to your heart, don't let it stray,
for one thing that's certain,
you will surely be a hurtin',
if you throw it all away."
"well, the rainman comes with his magic wand
and the judge says, ""mona can't have no bond.""
and the walls collide, mona cries,
and the rainman leaves in the wolfman's disguise.
i wanna be your lover, baby, i wanna be your man.
i wanna be your lover, baby,
i don't wanna be hers, i wanna be yours.
well, the undertaker in his midnight suit
says to the masked man, ""ain't you cute!""
well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf
and he says, ""you ain't so bad yourself.""
i wanna be your lover, baby, i wanna be your man.
i wanna be your lover, baby,
i don't wanna be hers, i wanna be yours.
well, jumpin' judy can't go no higher.
she had bullets in her eyes, and they fire.
rasputin he's so dignified,
he touched the back of her head an' he died.
i wanna be your lover, baby, i wanna be your man.
i wanna be your lover, baby,
i don't wanna be hers, i wanna be yours.
well, phaedra with her looking glass,
stretchin' out upon the grass.
she gets all messed up and she faints
that's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't.
i wanna be your lover, baby, i wanna be your man.
i wanna be your lover, baby,
i don't wanna be hers, i wanna be yours."
"the guilty undertaker sighs,
the lonesome organ grinder cries,
the silver saxophones say i should refuse you.
the cracked bells and washed out horns
blow into my face with scorn,
but it's not that way,
i wasn't born to lose you.
i want you, i want you,
i want you so bad,
honey, i want you.
the drunken politician leaps
upon the street where mothers weep
and the saviors who are fast asleep,
they wait for you.
and i wait for them to interrupt
me drinkin' from my broken cup
and ask me to
open up the gate for you.
i want you, i want you,
yes, i want you so bad,
honey, i want you.
now all my fathers, they've gone down
true love they've been without it.
but all their daughters put me down
'cause i don't think about it.
well, i return to the queen of spades
and talk with my chambermaid.
she knows that i'm not afraid
to look at her.
she is good to me
and there's nothing she doesn't see.
she knows where i'd like to be
but it doesn't matter.
i want you, i want you,
yes, i want you so bad,
honey, i want you.
now your dancing child with his chinese suit,
he spoke to me, i took his flute.
no, i wasn't very cute to him,
was i?
but i did it because he lied
because he took you for a ride
and because time was on his side
and because i . .
i want you, i want you,
yes, i want you so bad,
honey, i want you."
"close your eyes, close the door,
you don't have to worry any more.
i'll be your baby tonight.
shut the light, shut the shade,
you don't have to be afraid.
i'll be your baby tonight.
well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away,
we're gonna forget it.
that big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,
but we're gonna let it,
you won't regret it.
kick your shoes off, do not fear,
bring that bottle over here.
i'll be your baby tonight."
"you will search, babe,
at any cost.
but how long, babe,
can you search for what's not lost?
ev'rybody will help you,
some people are very kind.
but if i can save you any time,
come on, give it to me,
i'll keep it with mine.
i can't help it
if you might think i'm odd,
if i say i'm not loving you for what you are
but for what you're not.
everybody will help you
discover what you set out to find.
but if i can save you any time,
come on, give it to me,
i'll keep it with mine.
the train leaves
at half past ten,
but it'll be back tomorrow,
same time again.
the conductor he's weary,
he's still stuck on the line.
but if i can save you any time,
come on, give it to me,
i'll keep it with mine."
"i'm a fool to want you
i'm a fool to want you
to want a love that can't be true
a love that's there for others too
i'm a fool to hold you
such a fool to hold you
to seek a kiss, not mine alone
to share a kiss that devil has known
time and time again i said i'd leave you
time and time again i went away
but then would come the time when i would need you
and once again these words i'll have to say
take me back, i love you
pity me, i need you
i know it's wrong, it must be wrong
but right or wrong, i can't get along without you"
"ev'ry thing's all right
and then she's all the time in my neighborhood
she cries both day and night
i know because it was there
it's a milestone but she's down on her luck
and the day makes her lonely
and it's so hard to buck, i was there
i believe that she'd stop him if she would start to care
i believe that she'd look upon this side
and t' care and i'd go by the something
when she's on my way, but i don't belong there
no i don't belong to her
i don't belong to anybody
she's my prize forsaken angel
but she don't care she cries
she's a lone hearted mystic and she can carry on
when i'm there, she's all right
but she's not when i'm gone
heaven knows that the answer she's don't call in no one
she's a wave, a thing, beautiful she's mine for the one
and i'm also hesitating by temptation lest it runs
which it don't follow me
but i'm not there, i'm gone
now i'll cry tonight, like i cried the night before
and i'll feast on her eyes
but i'll dream about the door
so long, jesus, savior, blind faith worth to tell
it don't have consolation she's my
i was born to love her
but she knows that the kingdom waits so high above her
and i run but i race
but it's not too fast a pace
of cource i'll not deceive her
i'm not there, i'm gone
it's all about confusion and i cry for her"

"i'm sittin' on my terrace, lost in the stars
listening to the sounds of the sad guitars
been thinking it all over and i've thought it all through
i've made up my mind to give myself to you
i saw the first fall of snow
i saw the flowers come and go
i don't think that anyone ever has ever knew
i've made up my mind to give myself to you
i'm giving myself to you, i am
from salt lake city to birmingham
from east l. a. to san antone
i don't think i can bear to live my life alone
my eye's like a shooting star
it looks at nothin' here or there, looks at nothin' near of far
no one ever told me, it's just something i knew
i've made up my mind to give myself to you
if i had the wings of a snow white dove
i'd preach the gospel, the gospel of love
a love so real, a love so true
i've made up my mind to give myself to you
take me on traveling, you're a traveling man
show me something i don't understand
i'm not what i was, things aren't what they were
i'll go far away from home with her
i've traveled a long road of despair
i've met no other traveler there
lot of people gone, a lot of people i knew
i've made up my mind to give myself to you
well, my heart's like a river, a river that sings
just takes me a while to realize things
i've seen the sunrise, i've seen the dawn
i'll lay down beside you when everyone's gone
i've traveled from the mountains to the sea
i hope that the gods go easy with me
i knew you'd say yes, i'm saying it too
i've made up my mind to give myself to you"
"someone's got it in for me,
they're planting stories in the press
whoever it is
i wish they'd cut it out
but when they will i can only guess.
they say i shot a man named gray
and took his wife to italy,
she inherited a million bucks
and when she died it came to me.
i can't help it if i'm lucky.
people see me all the time
and they just can't remember how to act
their minds are filled with big ideas,
images and distorted facts.
even you, yesterday
you had to ask me where it was at,
i couldn't believe
after all these years,
you didn't know me better than that
sweet lady.
idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your mouth,
blowing down the backroads headin' south.
idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your teeth,
you're an idiot, babe.
it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
i ran into the fortune teller,
who said beware of lightning that might strike
i haven't known peace and quiet for so long
i can't remember what it's like.
there's a lone soldier on the cross
smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door
you didn't know it,
you didn't think it could be done,
in the final end he won the wars
after losin' every battle.
i woke up on the roadside,
daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
visions of your chestnut mare
shoot through my head
and are makin' me see stars
you hurt the ones that i love best
and cover up the truth with lies.
one day you'll be in the ditch,
flies buzzin' around your eyes,
blood on your saddle.
idiot wind,
blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
blowing through the curtains in your room.
idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your teeth,
you're an idiot, babe.
it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
it was gravity which pulled us down
and destiny which broke us apart
you tamed the lion in my cage
but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.
now everything's a little upside down,
as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped,
what's good is bad, what's bad is good,
you'll find out when you reach the top
you're on the bottom.
i noticed at the ceremony,
your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
i can't remember your face anymore,
your mouth has changed
your eyes don't look into mine.
the priest wore black on the seventh day
and sat stone faced while
the building burned.
i waited for you on the running boards,
near the cypress trees,
while the springtime turned slowly into autumn.
idiot wind,
blowing like a circle around my skull,
from the grand coulee dam to the capitol.
idiot wind,
blowing every time you move your teeth,
you're an idiot, babe.
it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
i can't feel you anymore,
i can't even touch the books you've read
every time i crawl past your door,
i been wishin' i was somebody else instead.
down the highway, down the tracks,
down the road to ecstasy,
i followed you beneath the stars,
hounded by your memory
and all your ragin' glory.
i been double crossed now for the very last time
and now i'm finally free,
i kissed goodbye
the howling beast on the borderline
which separated you from me.
you'll never know the hurt
i suffered nor the pain i rise above,
and i'll never know the same about you,
your holiness or your kind of love,
and it makes me feel so sorry.
idiot wind,
blowing through the buttons of our coats,
blowing through the letters that we wrote.
idiot wind,
blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
we're idiots, babe.
it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves."
"if dogs run free, then why not we
across the swooping plain?
my ears hear a symphony
of two mules, trains and rain.
the best is always yet to come,
that's what they explain to me.
just do your thing, you'll be king,
if dogs run free.
if dogs run free, why not me
across the swamp of time?
my mind weaves a symphony
and tapestry of rhyme.
oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
so it may flow and be,
to each his own, it's all unknown,
if dogs run free.
if dogs run free, then what must be,
must be, and that is all.
true love can make a blade of grass
stand up straight and tall.
in harmony with the cosmic sea,
true love needs no company,
it can cure the soul, it can make it whole,
if dogs run free."
"if not for you,
babe, i couldn't find the door,
couldn't even see the floor,
i'd be sad and blue,
if not for you.
if not for you,
babe, i'd lay awake all night,
wait for the mornin' light
to shine in through,
but it would not be new,
if not for you.
if not for you
my sky would fall,
rain would gather too.
without your love i'd be nowhere at all,
i'd be lost if not for you,
and you know it's true.
if not for you
my sky would fall,
rain would gather too.
without your love i'd be nowhere at all,
oh! what would i do
if not for you.
if not for you,
winter would have no spring,
couldn't hear the robin sing,
i just wouldn't have a clue,
anyway it wouldn't ring true,
if not for you."

"listen to me, baby,
there's something you must see.
i want to be with you, gal,
if you want to be with me.
but if you got to go,
it's all right.
but if you got to go, go now,
or else you gotta stay all night.
it ain't that i'm questionin' you.
to take part in any quiz.
it's just that i ain't got no watch
an' you keep askin' me what time it is.
but if you got to go,
it's all right.
but if you got to go, go now,
or else you gotta stay all night.
i am just a poor boy, baby,
lookin' to connect.

that i ain't got any respect.
but if you got to go,
it's all right.
but if you got to go, go now,
or else you gotta stay all night.
you know i'd have nightmares
and a guilty conscience, too,
if i kept you from anything
that you really wanted to do.
but if you got to go,
it's all right.
but if you got to go, go now,
or else you gotta stay all night.
it ain't that i'm wantin'
anything you never gave before.
it's just that i'll be sleepin' soon,
it'll be too dark for you to find the door.
but if you got to go,
it's all right.
but if you got to go, go now,
or else you gotta stay all night."
"if you see her, say hello, she might be in tangier
she left here last early spring, is livin' there, i hear
say for me that i'm all right though things get kind of slow
she might think that i've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.
we had a falling out, like lovers often will
and to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
and though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
she still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
if you get close to her, kiss her once for me
i always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free
oh, whatever makes her happy, i won't stand in the way
though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night i tried to make her stay.
i see a lot of people as i make the rounds
and i hear her name here and there as i go from town to town
and i've never gotten used to it, i've just learned to turn it off
either i'm too sensitive or else i'm gettin' soft.
sundown, yellow moon, i replay the past
i know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
if she's passin' back this way, i'm not that hard to find
tell her she can look me up if she's got the time."

i met my little sadie and i brought her down.
i ran right home and i went to bed
with a forty four smokeless under my head.
i began to think what a deed i'd done.
i grabbed my hat and i began to run.
i made a god run but i ran too slow;
they overtook me down in jericho
standing on a corner a ringin' my bell,
up stepped the sheriff from thomasville.
he said 'young man is you name brown?
remember you blowed sadie down.""
""oh yes sir, my name is lee.
i murdered little sadie in the first degree.
first degree and second degree.
if you've got any papers will you serve them to me?""
well they took me down town and they dressed me in black,
they put me on a train and they sent me back.
i had no one to go my bail;
they crammed me back into the county jail.
oh, yes they did.
the judge and the jury they took their stand.
the judge had the papers in his right hand.
forty one days, forty one nights;
forty one years to wear the ball and the stripes;
oh, no!
went out last night to take a little round.
i met little sadie and i blowed her down.

"i was in your presence for an hour or so
or was it a day? i truly don't know.
where the sun never set, where the trees hung low
by that soft and shining sea.
did you respect me for what i did
or for what i didn't do, or for keeping it hid?
did i lose my mind when i tried to get rid
of everything you see?
in the summertime, ah in the summertime,
in the summertime when you were with me.
i got the heart and you got the blood,
we cut through iron and we cut through mud.
then came the warnin' that was before the flood
that set everybody free.
fools they made a mock of sin,
our loyalty they tried to win
but you were closer to me than my next of kin
when they didn't want to know or see.
in the summertime, ah in the summertime,
in the summertime when you were with me.
strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
poverty and shame was theirs.
but all that sufferin' was not to be compared
with the glory that is to be.
and i'm still carrying the gift you gave,
it's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
it'll be with me unto the grave
and then unto eternity.
in the summertime, ah in the summertime,
in the summertime when you were with me."
"do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?
do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?
i've been burned before and i know the score
so you won't hear me complain.
will i be able to count on you
or is your love in vain?
are you so fast that you cannot see that i must have solitude?
when i am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
do you know my world, do you know my kind
or must i explain?
will you let me be myself
or is your love in vain?
well i've been to the mountain and i've been in the wind,
i've been in and out of happiness.
i have dined with kings, i've been offered wings
and i've never been too impressed.
all right, i'll take a chance, i will fall in love with you
if i'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too.
can you cook and sew, make flowers grow,
do you understand my pain?
are you willing to risk it all
or is your love in vain?"
"i married isis on the fifth day of may,
but i could not hold on to her very long.
so i cut off my hair and i rode straight away
for the wild unknown country where i could not go wrong.
i came to a high place of darkness and light.
the dividing line ran through the center of town.
i hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
a man in the corner approached me for a match.
i knew right away he was not ordinary.
he said, ""are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch?""
i said, ""i got no money."" he said, ""that ain't necessary.""
we set out that night for the cold in the north.
i gave him my blanket, he gave me his word.
i said, ""where are we goin'?"" he said we'd be back by the fourth.
i said, ""that's the best news that i've ever heard.""
i was thinkin' about turquoise, i was thinkin' about gold,
i was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace.
as we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
i was thinkin' about isis, how she thought i was so reckless.
how she told me that one day we would meet up again,
and things would be different the next time we wed,
if i only could hang on and just be her friend.
i still can't remember all the best things she said.
we came to the pyramids all embedded in ice.
he said, ""there's a body i'm tryin' to find.
if i carry it out it'll bring a good price.""
'twas then that i knew what he had on his mind.
the wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous.
we chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
when he died i was hopin' that it wasn't contagious,
but i made up my mind that i had to go on.
i broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
there was no jewels, no nothin', i felt i'd been had.
when i saw that my partner was just bein' friendly,
when i took up his offer i must a been mad.
i picked up his body and i dragged him inside,
threw him down in the hole and i put back the cover.
i said a quick prayer and i felt satisfied.
then i rode back to find isis just to tell her i love her.
she was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise.
blinded by sleep and in need of a bed,
i came in from the east with the sun in my eyes.
i cursed her one time then i rode on ahead.
she said, ""where ya been?"" i said, ""no place special.""
she said, ""you look different."" i said, ""well, i guess.""
she said, ""you been gone."" i said, ""that's only natural.""
she said, ""you gonna stay."" i said, ""if you want me to, yes.""
isis, oh, isis, you mystical child.
what drives me to you is what drives me insane.
i still can remember the way that you smiled
on the fifth day of may in the drizzlin' rain."
"go 'way from my window,
leave at your own chosen speed.
i'm not the one you want, babe,
i'm not the one you need.

someone to open each and every door,

no, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

no, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
go melt back into the night, babe,
everything inside is made of stone.
there's nothing in here moving
an' anyway i'm not alone.
you say you're looking for someone
who'll pick you up each time you fall,
to gather flowers constantly
an' to come each time you call,
a lover for your life an' nothing more,
but it ain't me, babe,
no, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
it ain't me you're lookin' for, babe."
"it must have been
that something lovers call fate
kept me saying
""i have to wait""
i saw them all, just couldn't fall   'til we met
it had to be you, it had to be you
i wandered around
and finally found
the somebody who
could make me be true
and could make me be blue
and even be glad
just to be sad
thinking of you
some others i've seen
might never be mean
might never be cross
or try to be boss
but they wouldn't do
for nobody else
gave me a thrill
with all your faults, i love you still
it had to be you
wonderful you
it had to be you
for nobody else
gave me a thrill
with all your faults, i love you still
it had to be you
wonderful you
it had to be you"

it hurts me too.
i want you, baby, just to understand
i don't wanna be your boss, baby
i just wanna be your man
when things go wrong, so wrong with you
it hurts me too.
now when you go home, you don't have to get along
come back to me, baby
where i live that's where you belong
when things go wrong, so wrong with you
it hurts me too.
i love you baby, and you know that it's true
i wouldn't mistreat you, baby
nothing in this world is like you
yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you
it hurts me too
when things go wrong, so wrong with you
it hurts me too.
so run here baby, put your little hands in mine
i've got something to tell you, baby

"darkness at the break of noon
shadows even the silver spoon
the handmade blade, the child's balloon
eclipses both the sun and moon
to understand you know too soon
there is no sense in trying.
pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
suicide remarks are torn
from the fool's gold mouthpiece
the hollow horn plays wasted words
proves to warn
that he not busy being born
is busy dying.
temptation's page flies out the door
you follow, find yourself at war
watch waterfalls of pity roar
you feel to moan but unlike before
you discover
that you'd just be
one more person crying.
so don't fear if you hear
a foreign sound to your ear
it's alright, ma, i'm only sighing.
as some warn victory, some downfall
private reasons great or small
can be seen in the eyes of those that call
to make all that should be killed to crawl
while others say don't hate nothing at all
except hatred.
disillusioned words like bullets bark
as human gods aim for their mark
made everything from toy guns that spark
to flesh colored christs that glow in the dark
it's easy to see without looking too far
that not much
is really sacred.
while preachers preach of evil fates
teachers teach that knowledge waits
can lead to hundred dollar plates
goodness hides behind its gates
but even the president of the united states
sometimes must have
to stand naked.
an' though the rules of the road have been lodged
it's only people's games that you got to dodge
and it's alright, ma, i can make it.
advertising signs that con you
into thinking you're the one
that can do what's never been done
that can win what's never been won
meantime life outside goes on
all around you.
you lose yourself, you reappear
you suddenly find you got nothing to fear
alone you stand with nobody near
when a trembling distant voice, unclear
startles your sleeping ears to hear
that somebody thinks
they really found you.
a question in your nerves is lit
yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
insure you not to quit
to keep it in your mind and not forgit
that it is not he or she or them or it
that you belong to.
although the masters make the rules
for the wise men and the fools
i got nothing, ma, to live up to.
for them that must obey authority
that they do not respect in any degree
who despise their jobs, their destinies
speak jealously of them that are free
cultivate what they do to be
nothing more than something
they invest in.
while some on principles baptized
to strict party platform ties
social clubs in drag disguise
outsiders they can freely criticize
tell nothing except who to idolize
and then say god bless him.
while one who sings with his tongue on fire
gargles in the rat race choir
bent out of shape from society's pliers
cares not to come up any higher
but rather get you down in the hole
that he's in.
but i mean no harm nor put fault
on anyone that lives in a vault
but it's alright, ma, if i can't please him.
old lady judges watch people in pairs
limited in sex, they dare
to push fake morals, insult and stare
while money doesn't talk, it swears
obscenity, who really cares propaganda, all is phony.
while them that defend what they cannot see
with a killer's pride, security
it blows the minds most bitterly
for them that think death's honesty
won't fall upon them naturally
life sometimes
must get lonely.
my eyes collide head on with stuffed graveyards
false gods, i scuff
at pettiness which plays so rough
walk upside down inside handcuffs
kick my legs to crash it off

and if my thought dreams could be seen
they'd probably put my head in a guillotine
but it's alright, ma, it's life, and life only."
"oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in london he did dwell.
he had a lovely daughter, the truth to you i'll tell,
oh, the truth to you i'll tell.
she had sweethearts a plenty and men of high degree.
there was none but jackie frazier, her true love e'er to be,
oh, her true love e'er to be.
""oh daughter, oh daughter, your body i will confine.
if none but jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
oh, would ever suit your mind.
""this body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
there's none but jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
oh, would have this heart of mine.
now jackie's gone sailing with trouble on his mind.
to leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
oh, his darling girl behind.
she went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
oh, convey herself away.
""before you step onboard, sir, your name i'd like to know.""
she smiled all in her countenance, said, ""they call me jack a roe,
oh, they call me jack a roe.""
""your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
oh, to face the cannonball.
""i know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small,
but they would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
oh, to see ten thousand fall.""
the war soon being over, they hunted all around.
among the dead and dying her darling love she found,
oh, her darling love she found.
she picked him up all in her arms and carries him to town,
and sent for her physician to quickly heal his wounds,
oh, to quickly heal his wounds.

this couple they got married, so why not you and me,

"well, she's got jet pilot eyes from her hips on down.
all the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town.
she's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench.
she weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.

but you've got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman
she's a man."
"1. come and listen for a moment, lads,
and hear me tell my tale.
how across the sea from england
i was condemned to sail.
now the jury found me guilty,
then says the judge, says he,
""oh, for life, jim jones, i'm sending you
across the stormy sea.
but take a tip before you ship
to join the iron gang.
don't get too g** in botany bay,
or else you'll surely hang.
or else you'll surely hang,"" says he.
""and after that, jim jones,
it's high above on the gallows tree
the crows will pick your bones.""
2. and our ship was high upon the sea
then pirates came along,
but the soldiers on our convict ship
were full five hundred strong.
for they opened fire and somehow drove
that pirate ship away.
but i'd rather have joined that pirate ship
tan gone to botany bay.
with the storms ragin' round us,
and the winds a blowin' gale,
i'd rather have drowned in misery
than gone to new south wales.
3. now it's day and night and the irons clang,
and like poor galley slaves
we toil and toil, and when we die
must fill dishonored graves,
and it's by and by i'll slip my chains,
well, into the bush i'll go
and i'll join the bravest rankers there,
jack donohue and co.
and some dark night, when everything
is silent in the town
i'll shoot those tyrants one and all,
i'll gun the flogger down.
oh, i'll give the land a little shock,
remember what i say,
and they'll yet regret they've sent jim jones
in chains to botany bay."

because.""
larry was the oldest, joey was next to last.
they called joe ""crazy,"" the baby they called ""kid blast.""
some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too.
it always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
joey, joey,
king of the streets, child of clay.
joey, joey,
what made them want to come and blow you away?
there was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
no one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
when they tried to strangle larry, joey almost hit the roof.
he went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof.
the war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners.
they stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs.
the hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim,
""let's blow this place to kingdom come, let con edison take the blame.""
but joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, ""we're not those kind of men.
it's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again.""
joey, joey,
king of the streets, child of clay.
joey, joey,
what made them want to come and blow you away?
the police department hounded him, they called him mr. smith
they got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with.
""what time is it?"" said the judge to joey when they met
""five to ten,"" said joey. the judge says, ""that's exactly what you get.""
he did ten years in attica, reading nietzsche and wilhelm reich
they threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike.
his closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
what it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
when they let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight
but he dressed like jimmy cagney and i swear he did look great.
he tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
to the boss he said, ""i have returned and now i want what's mine.""
joey, joey,
king of the streets, child of clay.
joey, joey,
why did they have to come and blow you away?
it was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
""i'm around too many children,"" he'd say, ""they should never know of one.""
yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe,
emptied out the register, said, ""tell 'em it was crazy joe.""
one day they blew him down in a clam bar in new york
he could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork.
he pushed the table over to protect his family
then he staggered out into the streets of little italy.

sister jacqueline and carmela and mother mary all did weep.
i heard his best friend frankie say, ""he ain't dead, he's just asleep.""
then i saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave
i guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
the sun turned cold over president street and the town of brooklyn mourned
they said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
and someday if god's in heaven overlookin' his preserve
i know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.

"john brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore.
his mama sure was proud of him!
he stood straight and tall in his uniform and all.
his mama's face broke out all in a grin.
""oh son, you look so fine, i'm glad you're a son
of mine,
you make me proud to know you hold a gun.
do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get,
and we'll put them on the wall when you come home.""
as that old train pulled out, john's ma began to
shout,
tellin' ev'ryone in the neighborhood:
""that's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier
now, you know.""
she made well sure her neighbors understood.
she got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
as she showed them to the people from next door.
and she bragged about her son with his uniform and
gun,
and these things you called a good old fashioned war.
oh! good old fashioned war!
then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come.
they ceased to come for about ten months or more.
then a letter finally came saying, ""go down and
meet the train.
your son's a coming home from the war.""
she smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
but she could not see her soldier son in sight.
but as all the people passed, she saw her son at last,
when she did she could hardly believe her eyes.
oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
and he wore a metal brace around his waist.
he whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not
know,
while she couldn't even recognize his face!
oh! lord! not even recognize his face.
""oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what
they done.
how is it you come to be this way?""
he tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
and the mother had to turn her face away.
""don't you remember, ma, when i went off to war
you thought it was the best thing i could do?
i was on the battleground, you were home... acting proud.
you wasn't there standing in my shoes.""
""oh, and i thought when i was there, god, what am
i doing here?
i'm a tryin' to kill somebody or die tryin'.
but the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
and i saw that his face looked just like mine.""
oh! lord! just like mine!
""and i couldn't help but think, through the
thunder rolling and stink,
that i was just a puppet in a play.
and through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke,
and a cannon ball blew my eyes away.""
as he turned away to walk, his ma was still in shock
at seein' the metal brace that helped him stand.
but as he turned to go, he called his mother close
and he dropped his medals down into her hand."
"john wesley harding
was a friend to the poor,

to hurt a honest man.
'twas down in chaynee county,
a time they talk about,
with his lady by his side
he took a stand.
and soon the situation there
was all but straightened out,
for he was always known
to lend a helping hand.
all across the telegraph
his name it did resound,
but no charge held against him

and there was no man around

he was never known

joshua gone barbados, he don't care at all
sonny child the overseer
i swear he's an ignorant man
walking through the canefield
pistol in his hand
strike be all in vain
joshua gone barbados
just like he don't know
people on the st. vincent
they got no place to go"
"nobody feels any pain
tonight as i stand inside the rain
everybody knows
that baby's got new clothes
but lately i see her ribbons and her bows
have fallen from her curls.
she takes just like a woman, yes, she does
she makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
and she aches just like a woman
but she breaks just like a little girl.
queen mary, she's my friend
yes, i believe i'll go see her again
nobody has to guess
that baby can't be blessed
till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
with her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
she takes just like a woman, yes
she makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
and she aches just like a woman
but she breaks just like a little girl.
it was raining from the first
and i was dying of thirst
so i came in here
and your long time curse hurts
but what's worse
is this pain in here
i can't stay in here
ain't it clear that?
i just can't fit
yes, i believe it's time for us to quit
when we meet again
introduced as friends
please don't let on that you knew me when
i was hungry and it was your world.
ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
you make love just like a woman, yes, you do
then you ache just like a woman
but you break just like a little girl."
"when you're lost in the rain in juarez
and it's eastertime too
and your gravity fails
and negativity don't pull you through
don't put on any airs
when you're down on rue morgue avenue
they got some hungry women there
and they really make a mess outa you
now if you see saint annie
please tell her thanks a lot
i cannot move
my fingers are all in a knot
i don't have the strength
to get up and take another shot
and my best friend, my doctor
won't even say what it is i've got
sweet melinda
the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
she speaks good english
and she invites you up into her room
and you're so kind
and careful not to go to her too soon
and she takes your voice
and leaves you howling at the moon
up on housing project hill
it's either fortune or fame
you must pick up one or the other
though neither of them are to be what they claim
if you're lookin' to get silly
you better go back to from where you came
because the cops don't need you
and man they expect the same
now all the authorities
they just stand around and boast
how they blackmailed the sergeant at arms
into leaving his post
and picking up angel who
just arrived here from the coast
who looked so fine at first
but left looking just like a ghost
i started out on burgundy
but soon hit the harder stuff
everybody said they'd stand behind me
when the game got rough
but the joke was on me
there was nobody even there to call my bluff
i'm going back to new york city
i do believe i've had enough"
"katie's been gone since the spring time;
she wrote one time'n sent her love.
katie's been gone for such a long time now.
i wonder what kind of love she's thinkin' of.
dear katie,
if you can hear me,
i can't wait to have ya near me.
oh, katie, since ya caught that bus,
well, i just don't know how things are with us.
i'm still here and you're out there.
katie laughed when i said i was lonely.
she said, there's no need t'feel that way.
katie said that i was her only one,
but then i wonder why she didn't wanna stay.
dear katie, if i'm the only one,
how much longer will you be gone?
oh, katie, won't ya tell me straight:
how much longer do i have to wait?
i'll believe you,
but please come through.
i know it's wrong to be apart this long;
you should be here, near me.
katie's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind.
she's gone to find some newer places,
left the old life far behind.
dear katie, dont ya miss your home?
i dont see why you had to roam.
dear katie, since you've been away
i lose a little something every day
i need you here, but you're still out there.
dear katie, please drop me a line,
just write, love, to tell me you're fine.
oh, katie, if you can hear me,
i just cant wait to have you near me.
i can only think
where are you,
what ya do, may be there's someone new."

"when yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
when you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
when yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace
in a slow motion crawl of life's busy race
no matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
if the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
if the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on
and the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
and yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
and the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
and yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
and you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
and lonesome comes up as down goes the day
and tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away
and you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
and yer rope is a slidin' 'cause yer hands are a drippin'
and yer sun decked desert and evergreen valleys
turn to broken down slums and trash can alleys
and yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a pourin'
and the lightnin's a flashing and the thunder's a crashin'
and the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a shakin'
and yer whole world's a slammin' and bangin'
and yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
and to yourself you sometimes say
""i never knew it was gonna be this way
why didn't they tell me the day i was born""
and you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
and you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet
and yer knee deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
and the whole world's a watchin' with a window peek stare
and yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a flying
and yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'
and yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
and you need it badly but it lays on the street
and yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
and you think yer ears might a been hurt
or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight blindin' dirt
and you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
when you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush
and all the time you were holdin' three queens
and it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean
like in the middle of life magazine
bouncin' around a pinball machine
and there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
that somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
but it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
and it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed
and no matter how you try you just can't say it
and yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
and yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
and yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
and the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
and his jaws start closin with you underneath
and yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
and you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
and you say to yourself just what am i doin'
on this road i'm walkin', on this trail i'm turnin'
on this curve i'm hanging
on this pathway i'm strolling, in the space i'm taking
in this air i'm inhaling
am i mixed up too much, am i mixed up too hard
why am i walking, where am i running
what am i saying, what am i knowing
on this guitar i'm playing, on this banjo i'm frailin'
on this mandolin i'm strummin', in the song i'm singin'
in the tune i'm hummin', in the words i'm writin'
in the words that i'm thinkin'
in this ocean of hours i'm all the time drinkin'
who am i helping, what am i breaking
what am i giving, what am i taking
but you try with your whole soul best
never to think these thoughts and never to let
them kind of thoughts gain ground
or make yer heart pound
but then again you know why they're around
just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
""cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
and you fear that they might catch you a sleeping
and you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
and you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
if that was you in the dream that was screaming
and you know that it's something special you're needin'
and you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
and no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
and you need something special
yeah, you need something special all right
you need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track
to shoot you someplace and shoot you back
you need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
that's been banging and booming and blowing forever
that knows yer troubles a hundred times over
you need a greyhound bus that don't bar no race
that won't laugh at yer looks
your voice or your face
and by any number of bets in the book
will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze
you need something to open up a new door
to show you something you seen before
but overlooked a hundred times or more
you need something to open your eyes
you need something to make it known
that it's you and no one else that owns
that spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
that the world ain't got you beat
that it ain't got you licked
it can't get you crazy no matter how many
times you might get kicked
you need something special all right
you need something special to give you hope
but hope's just a word
that maybe you said or maybe you heard
on some windy corner 'round a wide angled curve
but that's what you need man, and you need it bad
and yer trouble is you know it too good
""cause you look an' you start getting the chills
""cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
and it ain't on macy's window sill
and it ain't on no rich kid's road map
and it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
and it ain't made in no hollywood wheat germ
and it ain't on that dimlit stage
with that half wit comedian on it
ranting and raving and taking yer money
and you thinks it's funny
no you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
and it ain't in the seats of a supper club
and sure as hell you're bound to tell
that no matter how hard you rub
you just ain't a gonna find it on yer ticket stub
no, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
and it ain't in the pimple lotion people are sellin' you
and it ain't in no cardboard box house
or down any movie star's blouse
and you can't find it on the golf course
and uncle remus can't tell you and neither can santa claus
and it ain't in the cream puff hair do or cotton candy clothes
and it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
and it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
that come knockin' and tappin' in christmas wrappin'
sayin' ain't i pretty and ain't i cute and look at my skin
look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
when you can't even sense if they got any insides
these people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
no you'll not now or no other day
find it on the doorsteps made out a paper mache?br> and inside it the people made of molasses
that every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
and it ain't in the fifty star generals and flipped out phonies
who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
who breathe and burp and bend and crack
and before you can count from one to ten
do it all over again but this time behind yer back
my friend
the ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
and play games with each other in their sand box world
and you can't find it either in the no talent fools
that run around gallant
and make all rules for the ones that got talent
and it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
and think they're foolin' you
the ones who jump on the wagon
just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
to get their kicks, get out of it quick
and make all kinds of rnoney and chicks
and you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
sayin', ""christ do i gotta be like that
ain't there no one here that knows where i'm at
ain't there no one here that knows how i feel
good god almighty
that stuff ain't real""
no but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race
you can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
you gotta look some other place
and where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
where do you look for this lamp that's a burnin'
where do you look for this oil well gushin'
where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
where do you look for this hope that you know is there
and out there somewhere
and your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
you can touch and twist
and turn two kinds of doorknobs
you can either go to the church of your choice
or you can go to brooklyn state hospital
you'll find god in the church of your choice
you'll find woody guthrie in brooklyn state hospital
and though it's only my opinion
i may be right or wrong
you'll find them both
in the grand canyon
at sundown"
"lay down your weary tune, lay down,
lay down the song you strum,
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum.
struck by the sounds before the sun,
i knew the night had gone.
the morning breeze like a bugle blew
against the drums of dawn.
lay down your weary tune, lay down,
lay down the song you strum,
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum.
the ocean wild like an organ played,
the seaweed's wove its strands.
the crashin' waves like cymbals clashed
against the rocks and sands.
lay down your weary tune, lay down,
lay down the song you strum,
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum.
i stood unwound beneath the skies
and clouds unbound by laws.
the cryin' rain like a trumpet sang
and asked for no applause.
lay down your weary tune, lay down,
lay down the song you strum,
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum.
the last of leaves fell from the trees
and clung to a new love's breast.
the branches bare like a banjo played
to the winds that listened best.
i gazed down in the river's mirror
and watched its winding strum.
the water smooth ran like a hymn
and like a harp did hum.
lay down your weary tune, lay down,
lay down the song you strum,
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum."
"lenny bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
never did get any golden globe award, never made it to synanon.
he was an outlaw, that's for sure,
more of an outlaw than you ever were.
lenny bruce is gone but his spirit's livin' on and on.
maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out
but he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin'
about. never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies' heads,
he just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
he's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
lenny bruce is dead but he didn't commit any crime
he just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
i rode with him in a taxi once, only for a mile and a half,
seemed like it took a couple of months.
lenny bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone.
they said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules
he just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
they stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
he fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
lenny bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had."

honey, can i jump on it sometime?
yes, i just wanna see
if it's really that expensive kind

on a bottle of wine
your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
well, if you wanna see the sun rise
honey, i know where
we'll go out and see it sometime
we'll both just sit there and stare
me with my belt
wrapped around my head
and you just sittin' there
in your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
well, i asked the doctor if i could see you
it's bad for your health, he said
yes, i disobeyed his orders
i came to see you
but i found him there instead
you know, i don't mind him cheatin' on me
but i sure wish he'd take that off his head
your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
well, i see you got a new boyfriend
you know, i never seen him before
well, i saw him
makin' love to you
you forgot to close the garage door
you might think he loves you for your money

it's your brand new leopard skin pill box hat"

i want my arms around you

there's always been people that have to cause fear
they've been talking of the war now for many long
years

if i had rubies and riches and crowns
i'd buy the whole world and change things around

streams flood
let me smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood
let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy
leaves
let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace.

oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
let's keep it between us
we've been through too much
tough times that they never shared
they've had nothing to say to us before
now all of a sudden it's as if they've always cared
all we need is honesty
a little humility and trust

i know we're not perfect
then again, neither are they
they act like we got to live for them
as if there just ain't no other way
and it's makin' me kind of tired
can we just lay back for a moment
before we wake up and find ourselves
in a daze that's got us out of our minds?
there must be something we're overlooking here
we better drop down now and get back behind the lines
there's some things not fit for human ears
some things don't need to be discussed
oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
they'll tell you one thing and me another
'til we don't know who to trust
oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
let's keep it between us
before it all snaps and goes too far

tonight as i stand inside the rain
ev'rybody knows
that baby's got new clothes

have fallen from her curls.
she takes just like a woman, yes, she does
she makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
and she aches just like a woman
but she breaks just like a little girl.
queen mary, she's my friend
yes, i believe i'll go see her again
nobody has to guess
hat baby can't be blessed
till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
with her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
she takes just like a woman, yes, she does
she makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
and she aches just like a woman
but she breaks just like a little girl.
it was raining from the first
and i was dying there of thirst
so i came in here
and your long time curse hurts
but what's worse
is this pain in here
i can't stay in here
ain't it clear that?br>
i just can't fit
yes, i believe it's time for us to quit
when we meet again
introduced as friends
please don't let on that you knew me when
i was hungry and it was your world.
ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
you make love just like a woman, yes, you do
then you ache just like a woman
but you break just like a little girl."
"the evening winds are still i've lost the way and will
can't tell you where they went i just know what they meant
i'm always on my guard admitting life is hard
without you near me
the friend you used to be, so near and dear to me
you slipped so far away, where did we go astray
i passed the old school yard, admitting life is hard
without you near me
ever since the day, the day you went away
i felt that emptiness so wide
i don't know what's wrong or right
i just know i need strength to fight, strength to fight that world outside
since we've been out of touch i haven't felt that much
from day to barren day my heart stays locked away
i walk the boulevard, admitting life is hard
without you near me
the sun is sinking low i guess it's time to go
i feel a chilly breeze in place of memories
my dreams are locked and barred admitting life is hard
without you near me
hummmm
without you near me"
"when first i came to louisville, some pleasure there to find
a damsel there from lexington was pleasing to my mind
her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast
and the name she bore was flora, the lily of the west.
i courted lovely flora some pleasure for to find
but she turned unto another man whose sore distressed my mind
she robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest
then go, my lovely flora, the lily of the west.
away down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree
conversin' with my flora there, it seemed so strange to me
and the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress
i was betrayed by flora, the lily of the west.
i stepped up my rival, dagger in my hand
i seized him by the collar, and bodly made him stand
seing mad by desperation i pierced him to the breast
all this for lovely flora, the lily of the west.
i had to stand my trial, i had to make my plea
they placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me
although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
still i love my faithless flora, the lily of the west."
"the festival was over, the boys were all plannin' for a fall,
the cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall.
the curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down,
anyone with any sense had already left town.
he was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the jack of hearts.
he moved across the mirrored room,
""set it up for everyone"" he said,
then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their
heads. then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
""could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?""
then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
backstage the girls were playin' five card stud by the stairs,
lily had two queens, she was hopin' for a third to match her pair.
outside the streets were fillin' up, the window was open wide,
a gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside.
lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
big jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
he made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine.
with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste.
but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
she slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown.
she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
""sorry, darlin', that i'm late"" but he didn't seem to hear.
he was starin' into space over at the jack of hearts.
""i know i've seen that face before""; big jim was thinkin' to himself,
""maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf""
but then the crowd began to stamp their feet
and the house lights did dim
and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him,
starin' at the butterfly who just drew the jack of hearts.
lily was a princess, she was fair skinned and precious as a child,
she did whatever she had to do,
she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
she'd come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere.
but she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
the hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
the drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
it was known all around that lily had jim's ring
and nothing would ever come between lily and the king.
no, nothin' ever would except maybe the jack of hearts.
rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife,
she was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of big jim's wife.
she had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died.
she was gazin' to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away.
""has your luck run out"" she laughed at him,
""well, i guess you must
have known it would someday.
be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand new coat of paint,
i'm glad to see you're still alive, you're lookin' like a saint""
down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the jack of hearts.
the backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair.
""there's something funny going on,"" he said
""i can just feel it in the air""
he went to get the hangin' judge, but the hangin' judge was drunk,
as the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk.
there was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
lily's arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch,
she forgot all about the man she couldn't stand
who hounded her so much.
""i've missed you so""; she said to him, and he felt she was sincere,
but just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear.
just another night in the life of the jack of hearts.
no one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick,
the door to the dressing room burst open and a colt revolver clicked.
and big jim was standin' there, ya couldn't say surprised,
rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes.
she was with big jim but she was leanin' to the jack of hearts.
two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
and cleaned out the bank safe,
it's said that they got off with quite a haul.
in the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
for one more member who had business back in town.
but they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
the next day was hangin' day, the sky was overcast and black,
big jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back.
and rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
the hangin' judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink.
the only person on the scene missin' was the jack of hearts.
the cabaret was empty now, a sign said, ""closed for repair""
lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
she was thinkin' 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
thinkin' 'bout rosemary and thinkin' about the law.
but, most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the jack of hearts."
"1. oh, where is little maggie
over yonder she stands,

"went out last night to take a little round.
i met my little sadie and i brought her down.
i ran right home and i went to bed
with a forty four smokeless under my head.
i began to think what a deed i'd done,
i grabbed my hat and i began to run.
i made a god run but i ran too slow;
they overtook me down in jericho
standing on a corner ringin' my bell,
up stepped the sheriff from thomasville.
he said ""young man is you name brown?
remember the night you blowed little sadie down.""
""oh, yes sir, my name is lee.
i murdered little sadie in the first degree.
first degree and second degree,
if you've got any papers will you serve them to me?""
well they took me down town and they dressed me in black.
they put me on a train and they brought me back.
i had no one for to go my bail;
they crammed me back into the county jail.
the judge and the jury they took their stand.
the judge had the papers in his right hand.
forty one days, forty one nights;
forty one years to wear the ball and the stripes."
"since you've been gone,
i've been walking around
with my head bowed down to my shoes.
i've been living the blues
ev'ry night without you.
i don't have to go far
to know where you are,
strangers all give me the news.
i've been living the blues
ev'ry night without you.
i think that it's best,
i soon get some rest
and forget my pride.
but i can't deny
this feeling that i
carry for you deep down inside.
if you see me this way,
you'd come back and you'd stay,
oh, how could you refuse.
i've been living the blues
ev'ry night without you."
"i pulled out for san anton',
i never felt so good.
my woman said she'd meet me there
and of course, i knew she would.
the coachman, he hit me for my hook
and he asked me my name.
i give it to him right away,
then i hung my head in shame.
lo and behold! lo and behold!
lookin' for my lo and behold,
get me outa here, my dear man!
i come into pittsburgh
at six thirty flat.
i found myself a vacant seat
an' i put down my hat.
""what's the matter, molly, dear,
what's the matter with your mound?""
""what's it to ya, moby d***?
this is chicken town!""
lo and behold! lo and behold!
lookin' for my lo and behold,

gonna thread up!
lo and behold! lo and behold!
lookin' for my lo and behold,
get me outa here, my dear man!"
"1. i came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay,
and patiently stood by his tomb,
when in a low whisper i heard something say:
how sweetly i sleep here alone.
2. the tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
and gathering storms may arise,
but calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
the tears are all wiped from my eyes.
3. the call of my master compelled me from home,
no kindred or relative nigh.
i met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
my soul flew to mansions on high.
4. go tell my companion and children most dear
to weep not for me now i'm gone.
the same hand that led me through seas most severe
has kindly assisted me home."

lord, protect my child
as his youth now unfolds
he is centuries old
just to see him at play makes me smile
no matter what happens to me
no matter what my destiny
lord, protect my child
while the world is asleep
you can look at it and weep
few things you find are worthwhile
and though i don't ask for much
no material things to touch
lord, protect my child
he's young and on fire
full of hope and desire
in a world that's been raped, raped and defiled
if i fall along the way
and can't see another day
lord, protect my child
there'll be a time i hear tell
when all will be well
when god and man will be reconciled
but until men lose their chains
and righteousness reigns
lord, protect my child"

"my love she speaks like silence,
without ideals or violence,
she doesn't have to say she's faithful,
yet she's true, like ice, like fire.
people carry roses,
make promises by the hours,
my love she laughs like the flowers,
valentines can't buy her.
in the dime stores and bus stations,
people talk of situations,
read books, repeat quotations,
draw conclusions on the wall.
some speak of the future,
my love she speaks softly,
she knows there's no success like failure
and that failure's no success at all.
the cloak and dagger dangles,
madams light the candles.
in ceremonies of the horsemen,
even the pawn must hold a grudge.
statues made of match sticks,
crumble into one another,
my love winks, she does not bother,
she knows too much to argue or to judge.
the bridge at midnight trembles,
the country doctor rambles,
bankers' nieces seek perfection,
expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
the wind howls like a hammer,
the night blows cold and rainy,
my love she's like some raven
at my window with a broken wing."
"i'm walking through streets that are dead
walking, walking with you in my head
my feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
and the clouds are weeping
did i hear someone tell a lie?
did i hear someone's distant cry?
i spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
while i was sleeping
i'm sick of love but i'm in the thick of it
this kind of love i'm so sick of it
i see, i see lovers in the meadow
i see, i see silhouettes in the window
i watch them 'til they're gone and they leave me hanging on
to a shadow
i'm sick of love; i hear the clock tick
this kind of love; i'm love sick
sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
sometimes i wanna take to the road and plunder
could you ever be true?
i think of you
and i wonder
i'm sick of love; i wish i'd never met you
i'm sick of love; i'm trying to forget you
just don't know what to do
i'd give anything to
be with you"

the wagon come, they loaded him in,
i never saw the man again.
i've sung you my song, it ain't very long,
'bout an old man who never done wrong.
how he died no one can say,
they found him dead in the street one day."
"well i'm sitting in church
in an old wooden chair
i knew nobody
would look for me there
sorrow and pity
rule the earth and the skies
looking for nothing
anyone's eyes
once i had pretty girls
did me wrong
now i'm marching to the city
and the road ain't long
snowflakes are falling
around my head
lord have mercy
it feel heavy like lead
i been hit too hard
seen too much
nothing can heal me now
but your touch
once i had a pretty girl
she done me wrong
now i'm marching to the city
and the road ain't long
loneliness
got a mind of its own
the more people around
the more you feel alone
i'm chained to the earth
like a silent slave
trying to break free
out of death's dark cave
once i had a pretty girl
done me wrong
now i'm marching to the city
and the road ain't long
boys in the street
beginning to play
girls like birds
flying away
i'm carrying the roses
that were given to me
and i'm thinking about paradise
wondering what it might be
once i had a pretty girl
she done me wrong
now i'm marching to the city
and the road ain't long
go over to london
maybe g** paree
follow the river
you get to the sea
i was hoping we could drink from
life's clear streams
i was hoping we could dream
life's pleasant dreams
once i had a pretty girl
but she done me wrong
now i'm marching to the city
and the road ain't long
well the weak get weaker
and the strong stay strong
the train keeps rolling
all night long
she looked at me
with an irresistable glance
with a smile
that could make all the planets dance
once i had a pretty girl
she did me wrong
now i'm marching to the city
and the road ain't long
my house is on fire
burning to the skies
i thought the rain clouds
but the clouds passed by
when i'm gone
you'll remember my name
i'm gonna win my way
to wealth and fame
once i had a pretty girl
but she did me wrong
now i'm marching to the city
and the road ain't long
i don't know"
"come all you lads of high renown
that will hear of a fair young maiden
and she roved out on a summer's
day for to view the soldier's parading
they march so bold and they look so g**
the colours fine and the bands did play
and it caused young mary for to say
""i'll wed you me gallant soldier""
she viewed the soldiers on parade
and as they stood at their leisure
and mary to herself did say: ""at last i find my treasure
but oh how cruel my parents must be
to banish my true love away from me
well i'll leave them all and i'll go with thee
me bold and undaunted soldier""
""oh mary dear, your parents'
love i pray don't be unruly
for when you're in a foreign land
believe you rue it surely
perhaps in battle i might fall
from a shot from an angry cannonball
and you're so far from your daddy's hall
be advised by a gallant soldier. ""
""oh i have fifty guineas in right gold
likewise a hearth that's burning
and i'd leave them all and i'd go with
you me bold undaunted soldier
so don't say no but let me go
and i will face the daring foe
and we'll march together to and fro
and i'll wed you, my gallant soldier""
and when he saw her loyalty
and mary so true hearted
he said: ""me darling, married
we'll be and nothing but death will part us
and when we're in a foreign land
i'll guard you, darling, with my right hand
and hopes that god might stand a friend
with mary and her gallant soldier"""
"oh, fare thee well, my own true love, fare thee well but for a while
the ship is waiting and the wind blows high
and i am bound away for the sea, mary ann.
ten thousand miles away from home, ten thousand miles or more
the sea may freeze and the earth may burn
if i never nomore return to you, mary ann.
oh, don't you see that crow fly high, she'll surely turn to white
if never i prove false to you
let the day turn to night, my dear, mary ann.
if i had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
and a great big bowl for two to mix it in
i'd pour a drink for you my dear, mary ann
yes, i'd pour a drink for you my dear, mary ann."
"maybe someday you'll be satisfied
when you've lost everything you'll have nothing left to hide.
when you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
maybe you'll beg me to take you back.
maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
maybe then you'll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool.
maybe someday when you're by yourself alone
you'll know the love that i had for you was never my own.
maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
you'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned.
you'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
and you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
maybe someday, you will understand
that something for nothing is everybody's plan.
maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
when there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt.
when both of us, baby, were going though some sort of a test
neither one of us could do what we do best.
i should have known better, baby, i should have called your bluff.
i guess i was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
maybe someday, you'll believe me when i say
that i wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high
sayin' ""for whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?""
forgive me, baby, for what i didn't do
for not breakin' down no bedroom door to get at you.
always was a sucker for the right cross.
never wanted to go home 'til the last cent was lost.
maybe someday you will look back and see
that i made it so easy for you to follow me.
maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell.
i'm just as happy as you, baby, i just can't say it so well.
never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike.
there's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
you said you were going' to frisco, stay a couple of months.
i always liked san francisco, i was there for a party once.
maybe someday you'll see that it's true
there was no greater love than what i had for you."
"each time i see a crowd of people
just like a fool i stop and stare
it's really not the proper thing to do
but maybe you'll be there
i go out walking after midnight
along the lonely thoroughfare
it's not the time or place to look for you
but maybe you'll be there
you said your arms
would always hold me
you said you lips
were mine alone to kiss
now after all those things you told me
how can it end like this
someday if all my prayers are answered
i'll hear a footstep on the stair
with anxious heart
i'll hurry to the door
and maybe you'll
be there"
"meet me in the morning, 56th and wabasha

when you kissed my lips?"
"melancholy mood
forever haunts me
steals upon me in the night
forever taunts me
oh, what a lonely soul am i
stranded high and dry
by a melancholy mood
gone is every joy and inspiration
tears are all i have to show
no consolation
all i can see is grief and gloom
till the crack of doom
oh, melancholy mood
deep in the night
i search for a trace
of a lingering kiss
a warm embrace
but love is a whimsy
and as flimsy as lace
and my arms embrace
an empty space
melancholy mood, why must you blind me
pity me and break the chains
the chains that bind me
won't you release me, set me free
bring her back to me
oh, melancholy mood"

"you took a part of me that i really miss
i keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
you told yourself a lie; that's all right mama, i told myself one too
i'm trying to get closer but i'm still a million miles from you
you took the silver, you took the gold
you left me standing out in the cold
people ask about you; i didn't tell them everything i knew
well i'm trying to get closer, but i'm still a million miles from you
i'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
did so many things i never did intend to do
well i'm trying to get closer, but i'm still a million miles from you
i need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
i need every bit of it for the places that i go
sometimes i wonder just what it's all coming to
well i'm tryin' to get closer, but i'm still a million miles from you
well i don't dare close my eyes and i don't dare wink
maybe in the next life i'll be able to hear myself think
feel like talking to somebody but i just don't know who
well, i'm tryin' to get closer but i'm still a million miles from you
the last thing you said before you hit the street
""gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet""
i said, ""that's all right mama.... you..... you do what you gotta do""
well, i'm tryin' to get closer; i'm still a million miles from you

rock me for a little while, rock me 'til there's nothing left to feel
and i'll rock you too

oh, lucky's been drivin' a long, long time
and now he's stuck on top of the hill.
with twelve forward gears, it's been a long hard climb,
and with all of them ladies, though, he's lonely still.
who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
who's gonna let it roll?
who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
mighty mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load.
beneath his bound'ries, what more can i tell,
with all of his trav'lin', but i'm still on that road.

"every step of the way, we walk the line
your days are numbered, so are mine
time is piling up, we struggle and we stray
we're all boxed in, nowhere to escape
city's just a jungle, more games to play
trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
i was raised in the country, i been working in the town
i been in trouble ever since i set my suitcase down
got nothing for you, i had nothing before
don't even have anything for myself anymore
sky full of fire, pain pouring down
nothing you can sell me, i'll see you around
all my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long
well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall
say anything you wanna, i have heard it all
i was thinking about the things that rosie said
i was dreaming i was sleeping in rosie's bed
walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
feeling like a stranger nobody sees
so many things that we never will undo
i know you're sorry, i'm sorry too
some people will offer you their hand and some won't
last night i knew you, tonight i don't
i need something strong to distract my mind
i'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind
well i got here following the southern star
i crossed that river just to be where you are
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long
well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast
i'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
but my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
i've got nothing but affection for all those who sailed with me
everybody's moving, if they ain't already there
everybody's got to move somewhere
stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
things should start to get interesting right about now
my clothes are wet, tight on my skin
not as tight as the corner that i painted myself in
i know that fortune is waiting to be kind
so give me your hand and say you'll be mine
well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
you can always come back, but you can't come back all the way
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long"
"i got mixed up confusion
man, it's a killin' me
well, there's too many people
and they're all too hard to please
well, my hat's in my hand
babe, i'm walkin' down the line
an' i'm lookin' for a woman
whose head's mixed up like mine
well, my head's full of questions
my temp'rature's risin' fast
well, i'm lookin' for some answers
but i don't know who to ask
but i'm walkin' and wonderin'
and my poor feet don't ever stop

i'm hung over, hung down, hung up!"
"words and music by bob dylan
the seasons they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
to hear again the songbird's sweet melodious tone
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone
the dusky light the day is losing
orchids, poppies, black eyed susan
the earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone
the air is thick and heavy all along the levee
where the geese into the countryside have flown
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone
well, i'm preaching peace and harmony
the blessings of tranquility
yet i know when the time is right to strike
i take you 'cross the river, dear
you've no need to linger here
i know the kinds of things you like
the clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs
the branches cast their shadows over stone
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone
the boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees
the petals pink and white, the wind has blown
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone
the trailing moss in mystic glow, the purple blossom soft as snow
my tears keep flowing to the sea
doctor, lawyer, indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief
for whom does the bell toll for, love?
it tolls for you and me
old pulse's running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
yellow fields with twisted oaks that grow
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone"
"i've been a moonshiner,
for seventeen long years,
i've spent all my money,
on whiskey and beer,
i go to some hollow,
and sit at my still
and if whiskey dont kill me,
then i dont know what will,
i go to some bar room,
and drink with my friends,
where the women cant follow,
and see what i spend,
god bless them pretty women,
i wish they was mine,
their breath is as sweet,
the dew on the vine,
let me eat when i am hungry,
let me drink when i am dry,
a dollar when i am hard up,
religion when i die,
the whole world's a bottle,
and life's but a dram,
when the bottle gets empty,
it sure aint worth a damn."
"you say you love me
and you're thinkin' of me,
but you know you could be wrong.
you say you told me
that you wanna hold me,
but you know you're not that strong.
i just can't do what i done before,
i just can't beg you any more.
i'm gonna let you pass
and i'll go last.
then time will tell just who fell
and who's been left behind,
when you go your way and i go mine.
you say you disturb me
and you don't deserve me,
but you know sometimes you lie.
you say you're shakin'
and you're always achin',
but you know how hard you try.
sometimes it gets so hard to care,
it can't be this way ev'rywhere.
and i'm gonna let you pass,
yes, and i'll go last.
then time will tell just who fell
and who's been left behind,
when you go your way and i go mine.
the judge, he holds a grudge,
he's gonna call on you.
but he's badly built
and he walks on stilts,
watch out he don't fall on you.
you say you're sorry
for tellin' stories
that you know i believe are true.
you say ya got some
other kinda lover
and yes, i believe you do.
you say my kisses are not like his,
but this time i'm not gonna tell you why that is.
i'm just gonna let you pass,
yes, and i'll go last.
then time will tell who fell
and who's been left behind,
when you go your way and i go mine."
"most of the time
i'm clear focused all around,
most of the time
i can keep both feet on the ground,
i can follow the path, i can read the signs,
stay right with it, when the road unwinds,
i can handle whatever i stumble upon,
i don't even notice she's gone,
most of the time.
most of the time
it's well understood,
most of the time
i wouldn't change it if i could,
i can't make it all match up, i can hold my own,
i can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
i can survive, i can endure
and i don't even think about her
most of the time.
most of the time
my head is on straight,
most of the time
i'm strong enough not to hate.
i don't build up illusion 'till it makes me sick,
i ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick
i can smile in the face of mankind.
don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
most of the time.
most of the time
she ain't even in my mind,
i wouldn't know her if i saw her
she's that far behind.
most of the time
i can't even be sure
if she was ever with me
or if i was with her.
most of the time
i'm halfway content,
most of the time
i know exactly where i went,
i don't cheat on myself, i don't run and hide,
hide from the feelings, that are buried inside,
i don't compromised and i don't pretend,
i don't even care if i ever see her again
most of the time."
"i pounded on a farmhouse
lookin' for a place to stay.
i was mighty, mighty tired,
i had gone a long, long way.
i said, ""hey, hey, in there,
is there anybody home?""
i was standin' on the steps
feelin' most alone.
well, out comes a farmer,
he must have thought that i was nuts.
he immediately looked at me
and stuck a gun into my guts.
i fell down
to my bended knees,
saying, ""i dig farmers,
don't shoot me, please!""
he cocked his rifle
and began to shout,
""you're that travelin' salesman
that i have heard about.""
i said, ""no! no! no!
i'm a doctor and it's true,
i'm a clean cut kid
and i been to college, too.""
then in comes his daughter
whose name was rita.
she looked like she stepped out of
la dolce vita.
i immediately tried to cool it
with her dad,
and told him what a
nice, pretty farm he had.
he said, ""what do doctors
know about farms, pray tell?""
i said, ""i was born
at the bottom of a wishing well.""
well, by the dirt 'neath my nails
i guess he knew i wouldn't lie.
""i guess you're tired,""
he said, kinda sly.
i said, ""yes, ten thousand miles
today i drove.""
he said, ""i got a bed for you
underneath the stove.
just one condition
and you go to sleep right now,
that you don't touch my daughter
and in the morning, milk the cow.""
i was sleepin' like a rat
when i heard something jerkin'.
there stood rita
lookin' just like tony perkins.
she said, ""would you like to take a shower?
i'll show you up to the door.""
i said, ""oh, no! no!
i've been through this before.""
i knew i had to split
but i didn't know how,
when she said,
""would you like to take that shower, now?""
well, i couldn't leave
unless the old man chased me out,
'cause i'd already promised
that i'd milk his cows.
i had to say something
to strike him very weird,
so i yelled out,
""i like fidel castro and his beard.""
rita looked offended
but she got out of the way,
as he came charging down the stairs
sayin', ""what's that i heard you say?""
i said, ""i like fidel castro,
i think you heard me right,""
and ducked as he swung
at me with all his might.
rita mumbled something
'bout her mother on the hill,
as his fist hit the icebox,
he said he's going to kill me
if i don't get out the door
in two seconds flat,
""you unpatriotic, rotten doctor commie rat.""
well, he threw a reader's digest
at my head and i did run,
i did a somersault
as i seen him get his gun
and crashed through the window
at a hundred miles an hour,
and landed fully blast
in his garden flowers.
rita said, ""come back!""
as he started to load
the sun was comin' up
and i was runnin' down the road.
well, i don't figure i'll be back
there for a spell,
even though rita moved away
and got a job in a motel.
he still waits for me,
constant, on the sly.
he wants to turn me in
to the f.b.i.
me, i romp and stomp,
thankful as i romp,
without freedom of speech,
i might be in the swamp."
"i like to spend some time in mozambique
the sunny sky is aqua blue
and all the couples dancing cheek to cheek.
it's very nice to stay a week or two.
and maybe fall in love just me and you.
there's lots of pretty girls in mozambique
and plenty time for good romance
and everybody likes to stop and speak
to give the special one you seek a chance
or maybe say hello with just a glance.
lying next to her by the ocean
reaching out and touching her hand,
whispering your secret emotion
magic in a magical land.
and when it's time for leaving mozambique,
to say goodbye to sand and sea,
you turn around to take a final peek
and you see why it's so unique to be
among the lovely people living free
upon the beach of sunny mozambique."
"i knew a man bojangles and he'd dance for you in worn out shoes
silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants, that old soft shoe
he'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, will he likely touch down ?
mr. bojangles, mr. bojangles, dance.
i met him in a cell in new orleans, i was down and out
he looked to me to be the eye of age as he spoke right out
he talked of life, he talked of life, laughing slapped his leg stale
mr. bojangles, mr. bojangles, dance.
he said the name bojangles and he danced a lick all across the cell
he grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh he jumped so high and he
clicked up his heels
he let go laugh, he let go laugh, shook back his clothes all around
mr. bojangles, mr. bojangles, dance, yeah, dance.
he danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughtout the south
he spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him just travelled about
hid dog up and died, he up and died, and after 20 years he still grieves
mr. bojangles, mr. bojangles, dance.
he said ""i dance now at every chance at honky tonks for drinks and tips
but most of the time i spend behind these county bars, cause i drinks a bit""
he shook his head, yes he shook his head, i heard someone ask him, Ã¨Â¥Â­lease?
mr. bojangles, mr. bojangles, dance, dance, mr bojangles, dance."
"it was a dark day in dallas, november '63

being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb

""of course we do, we know who you are""
then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
shot down like a dog in broad daylight
was a matter of timing and the timing was right

"crimson flames tied through my ears
rollin' high and mighty traps
pounced with fire on flaming roads
using ideas as my maps
""we'll meet on edges, soon,"" said i
proud 'neath heated brow.
ah, but i was so much older then,
'm younger than that now.
half wracked prejudice leaped forth
""rip down all hate,"" i screamed
lies that life is black and white
spoke from my skull. i dreamed
romantic facts of musketeers
foundationed deep, somehow.
ah, but i was so much older then,
i'm younger than that now.
girls' faces formed the forward path
from phony jealousy
to memorizing politics
of ancient history
flung down by corpse evangelists
unthought of, though, somehow.
ah, but i was so much older then,
i'm younger than that now.
a self ordained professor's tongue
too serious to fool
spouted out that liberty
is just equality in school
""equality,"" i spoke the word
as if a wedding vow.
ah, but i was so much older then,
i'm younger than that now.
in a soldier's stance, i aimed my hand
at the mongrel dogs who teach
fearing not that i'd become my enemy
in the instant that i preach
my existence led by confusion boats
mutiny from stern to bow.
ah, but i was so much older then,
i'm younger than that now.
yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
too noble to neglect
deceived me into thinking
i had something to protect
good and bad, i define these terms
quite clear, no doubt, somehow.

i'm younger than that now."

i've been visiting mosques and monasteries

i wish you'd've taken me with you
wherever you went
they talk all night and they talk all day
but not for a minute
do i believe anything they say
i'm gon' bring someone to life, someone i've never seen
you know what i mean
you know exactly what i mean
i'll take the scar faced pacino
and the godfather vandal
mix it up and attack, and get a robot commander
if i do it all right and put the head on straight
i'll be saved by the creature that i create
i'll get blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice
i don't gamble with cards and i don't shoot no dice
can you look in my face with your sightless eyes?
can you cross your heart and hope to die?
i'll bring someone to life, someone for real
someone who feels the way that i feel
i study sanskrit and arabic to improve my mind
i wanna do things for the benefit of all my my kind

you can bring it to me on a silver tray
i'll bring someone to life, spare no expense
do it with decency and common sense
can you tell me what it means, to be or not to be?
you won't get away with fooling me
can you help me walk that good land mile?
can you give me the blessings of your smile?
i'll bring someone to life, use all of my powers
do it in the dark in the wee, small hours
i can see the history of the whole human race
it's all right there, it's carved into your face
should i break it all down? should i fall on my knees?
is there light at the end of the tunnel
can you tell me please?

where the trojan women and children
were sold into slavery
long before the first crusade
way back before england or america were made

you've got what they call the immortal spirit
you can feel it all night, you can feel it in the morn
it creeps in your body, the day you were born
one strike of lightning is all that i need
and a blast of electricity
that runs at top speed

i just want to say that hell's my wife's home town
home town, home town
she can make you steal, make you rob
give you the hives, make you lose your job
make things bad, she can make things worse
she got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse
one of these days, i'll end up on the run
i'm pretty sure, she'll make me kill someone

i just want to say that hell's my wife's home town

i still can remember the day we met
i lost my reason long ago
my love for her is all i know

look down angel, from the skies
help my, weary soul to rise
i kissed her cheek, i dragged your frownyou broke my heart, i was your friend 'til now.
it's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
if i cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
in the courtyard, of the golden sun
you stand and fight, or you break and run
you went and lost, your lovely head
for a drink of wine, and a crust of bread
it's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
if i cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
we neutered and we plundered, on distant shores
why is my share, not equal to yours
your father left you, your mother too

this is hard country, to stay alive in
blades are everywhere, and they're breaking my skin

you won't get out, of here unscarred.

about a thousand tons, i couldn't count them all
yesterday, i could've thrown them all in the sea

put your arms around me, where they belong
i won't take you under, for the ghost to ridelay my hands all over ya, tie you to my side

if i cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
i've got a heavy stacked woman, with a smile on her face
and she has crowned, my soul with grace
im still hurting from an arrow, that pierced my chest
i'm gonna have to take my head, and bury it between your breasts

if i cant work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
been dark all night, but now it's dawn
the moving finger, is moving on
you can guard me, while i sleep
piss away, the tears i weep

we've been to the west, and we going back again

saying, ""be gentle brother, be gentle and pray.""

seen you turn the corner, seen your bootheels spark,
seen you in the daylight, and watched you in the dark.

well, if you believe in something long enough you just naturally come to think it's true.
there ain't no wall you can't cross over, ain't no fire you can't walk through.

he got no place to escape to, no place to run.
he's the neighborhood bully.
the neighborhood bully just lives to survive,
he's criticized and condemned for being alive.
he's not supposed to fight back, he's supposed to have thick skin,
he's supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
he's the neighborhood bully.
the neighborhood bully been driven out of every land,
he's wandered the earth an exiled man.
seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn,
he's always on trial for just being born.
he's the neighborhood bully.
well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad.
the bombs were meant for him.
he was supposed to feel bad.
he's the neighborhood bully.
well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim
that he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him,
'cause there's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
and a license to kill him is given out to every maniac.
he's the neighborhood bully.
he got no allies to really speak of.
what he gets he must pay for, he don't get it out of love.
he buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied
but no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
he's the neighborhood bully.
well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
they pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease.
now, they wouldn't hurt a fly.
to hurt one they would weep.
they lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
he's the neighborhood bully.
every empire that's enslaved him is gone,
egypt and rome, even the great babylon.
he's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
in bed with nobody, under no one's command.
he's the neighborhood bully.
now his holiest books have been trampled upon,
no contract he signed was worth what it was written on.
he took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
he's the neighborhood bully.
what's anybody indebted to him for?
nothin', they say.
he just likes to cause war.
pride and prejudice and superstition indeed,
they wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
he's the neighborhood bully.
what has he done to wear so many scars?
does he change the course of rivers?
does he pollute the moon and stars?
neighborhood bully, standing on the hill,
running out the clock, time standing still,
neighborhood bully."

in secret, for pieces of change.
the empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
and it makes you feel violent and strange.

china doll, alcohol, duality, mortality.

"come gather 'round friends
and i'll tell you a tale
of when the red iron pits ran plenty.
but the cardboard filled windows
and old men on the benches
tell you now that the whole town is empty.
in the north end of town,
my own children are grown
but i was raised on the other.
in the wee hours of youth,
my mother took sick
and i was brought up by my brother.
the iron ore poured
as the years passed the door,
the drag lines an' the shovels they was a humming.
'til one day my brother
failed to come home
the same as my father before him.
well a long winter's wait,
from the window i watched.
my friends they couldn't have been kinder.
and my schooling was cut
as i quit in the spring
to marry john thomas, a miner.
oh the years passed again
and the givin' was good,
with the lunch bucket filled every season.
what with three babies born,
the work was cut down
to a half a day's shift with no reason.
then the shaft was soon shut
and more work was cut,
and the fire in the air, it felt frozen.
'til a man come to speak
and he said in one week
that number eleven was closin'.
they complained in the east,
they are paying too high.
they say that your ore ain't worth digging.
that it's much cheaper down
in the south american towns
where the miners work almost for nothing.
so the mining gates locked
and the red iron rotted
and the room smelled heavy from drinking.
where the sad, silent song
made the hour twice as long
as i waited for the sun to go sinking.
i lived by the window
as he talked to himself,
this silence of tongues it was building.
then one morning's wake,
the bed it was bare,
and i's left alone with three children.
the summer is gone,
the ground's turning cold,
the stores one by one they're a foldin'.
my children will go
as soon as they grow.
well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them."
"shadows are falling and i've been here all day
it's too hot to sleep time is running away
feel like my soul has turned into steel
i've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal
there's not even room enough to be anywhere
it's not dark yet, but it's getting there
well my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
behind every beautiful face there's been some kind of pain
she wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
she put down in writing what was in her mind
i just don't see why i should even care
it's not dark yet, but it's getting there
well, i've been to london and i've been to g** paree
i've followed the river and i got to the sea
i've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
i ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes
sometimes my burden seems more than i can bear
it's not dark yet, but it's getting there
i was born here and i'll die here against my will
i know it looks like i'm moving, but i'm standing still
every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
i can't even remember what it was i came here to get away from
don't even hear a murmur of a prayer
it's not dark yet, but it's getting there."
"nothing was delivered
and i tell this truth to you,
not out of spite or anger
but simply because it's true.

giving back all of what you owe,

the sooner you can go.
nothing is better, nothing is best,
take heed of this and get plenty of rest.
nothing was delivered
but i can't say i sympathize
with what your fate is going to be,
yes, for telling all those lies.
now you must provide some answers
for what you sell has not been received,
and the sooner you come up with them,
the sooner you can leave.
nothing is better, nothing is best,
take heed of this and get plenty rest.
nothing was delivered
and it's up to you to say
just what you had in mind
when you made ev'rybody pay.
no, nothing was delivered,
yes, 'n' someone must explain
that as long as it takes to do this
then that's how long that you'll remain.

"oh, sister, when i come to lie in your arms
you should not treat me like a stranger.
our father would not like the way that you act
and you must realize the danger.
oh, sister, am i not a brother to you
and one deserving of affection?
and is our purpose not the same on this earth,
to love and follow
his direction?
we grew up together
from the cradle to the grave
we died and were reborn
and then mysteriously saved.
oh, sister, when i come to knock on your door,
don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
you may not see me tomorrow."
"on a little street in singapore
with me   beside a lotus covered door
a veil of moonlight on her lovely face
how pale the hands that held me in embrace
my sails tonight
are filled with perfume of shalimar
and temple bells that guide me to her shore
and then i hold you in my arms
and love the way i loved before
on a little street in singapore"

so glad you came around,
hold on to me so tight
and heat up some coffee grounds.
we got much to talk about
and much to reminisce,
it sure is right
on a night like this.
on a night like this
so glad you've come to stay
hold on to me, pretty miss
say you'll never go away to stray.
run your fingers down my spine
bring me a touch of bliss
it sure feels right
on a night like this.
on a night like this
i can't get any sleep,
the air is so cold outside
and the snow's so deep.
build a fire, throw on logs
and listen to it hiss
and let it burn, burn, burn, burn
on a night like this.
put your body next to mine
and keep me company,
there is plenty a room for all,
so please don't elbow me.
let the four winds blow
around this old cabin door,
if i'm not too far off i think we did this once
before.

honey, do you have to ask?
well, i go to pet your monkey
i get a face full of claws
i ask who's in the fireplace

he's wearing a derby hat
then you ask why i don't live here
honey, how come you have to ask me that?
well, i asked for something to eat
i'm hungry as a hog
so i get brown rice, seaweed
and a dirty hot dog
i've got a hole
where my stomach disappeared

honey, i gotta think you're really weird.

i lost the only pal i had,
i just could not be what she wanted me to be.
i will turn my head up high
to that dark and rolling sky,
for tonight no light will shine on me.
i was so mistaken when i thought that she'd be true,
i had no idea what a woman in love would do!
one more night, i will wait for the light
while the wind blows high above the tree.
oh, i miss my darling so, i didn't mean to see her go,
but tonight no light will shine on me.

that you'd be comin' back in a little while
i didn't know that you were sayin' ""goodbye"" for good

sooner or later, one of us must know

that you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
an' i told you, as you clawed out my eyes

"down the street the dogs are barkin'
and the day is a gettin' dark.
as the night comes in a fallin',
the dogs 'll lose their bark.
an' the silent night will shatter
from the sounds inside my mind,
for i'm one too many mornings
and a thousand miles behind.
from the crossroads of my doorstep,
my eyes they start to fade,
as i turn my head back to the room
where my love and i have laid.
an' i gaze back to the street,
the sidewalk and the sign,

"as i was out walking on a corner one day,
i spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay.
his face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
and i guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
only a hobo, but one more is gone
leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
leavin' nobody to carry him home
only a hobo, but one more is gone
a blanket of newspaper covered his head,
as the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed.
one look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
and a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
only a hobo, but one more is gone
leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
leavin' nobody to carry him home
only a hobo, but one more is gone
does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
to look up on the world from a hole in the ground,
to wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
to lie in the gutter and die with no name?
only a hobo, but one more is gone
leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
leavin' nobody to carry him home
only a hobo, but one more is gone"
"a bullet from the back of a bush took medgar evers' blood.
a finger fired the trigger to his name.
a handle hid out in the dark
a hand set the spark
two eyes took the aim
behind a man's brain
but he can't be blamed
he's only a pawn in their game.
a south politician preaches to the poor white man,
""you got more than the blacks, don't complain.
you're better than them, you been born with white skin,"" they explain.
and the negro's name
is used it is plain
for the politician's gain
as he rises to fame
and the poor white remains
on the caboose of the train
but it ain't him to blame
he's only a pawn in their game.
the deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
and the marshals and cops get the same,
but the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
he's taught in his school
from the start by the rule
that the laws are with him
to protect his white skin
to keep up his hate
so he never thinks straight
'bout the shape that he's in
but it ain't him to blame
he's only a pawn in their game.
from the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks,
and the hoof beats pound in his brain.
and he's taught how to walk in a pack
shoot in the back
with his fist in a clinch
to hang and to lynch
to hide 'neath the hood
to kill with no pain
like a dog on a chain
he ain't got no name
but it ain't him to blame
he's only a pawn in their game.
today, medgar evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
they lowered him down as a king.
but when the shadowy sun sets on the one
that fired the gun
he'll see by his grave
on the stone that remains
carved next to his name
his epitaph plain:
only a pawn in their game."

me, my gal and my gal's son
we got met with a tear gas bomb
don't even know why we come
we're goin' back where we come from

trails of troubles,
roads of battles,
paths of victory,

"well i'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
nothing more wretched than what i must endure
i'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
i could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
sooner or later you make a mistake,
i'll put you in a chain that you never will break
legs and arms and body and bone
i pay in blood, but not my own.
night after night, day after day
they strip your useless hopes away

the more i die the more i live

you could put me out in front of a firing squad
i've been out and around with the rising men
just like you my handsome friend
my head's so hard, must be made of stone
i pay in blood, but not my own.
another politician pumping out the piss
another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
you got the same eyes that your mother does
if only you could prove who your father was
someone must of slipped a drug in yer wine
you gulped it down and you cross the line
man can't live by bread alone
i pay in blood, but not my own.
how i made it back home, nobody knows
or how i survived so many blows
i've been thru hell, what good did it do?
you bastard!!! i'm suppose to respect you!!
i'll give you justice, i'll fattem your purse
show me your moral that you reversed
hear me holler and hear me moan
i pay in blood but not my own.
you get your lover in the bed
come here i'll break your lousy head
our nation must be saved and freed
you've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
this is how i spend my days
i came to bury, not to raise
i'll drink my fill and sleep alone
i play in blood, but not my own."

"we live in a political world,
love don't have any place.
we're living in times where men commit crimes
and crime don't have a face
we live in a political world,
icicles hanging down,
wedding bells ring and angels sing,
clouds cover up the ground.
we live in a political world,
wisdom is thrown into jail,
it rots in a cell, is misguided as hell
leaving no one to pick up a trail.
we live in a political world
where mercy walks the plank,
life is in mirrors, death disappears
up the steps into the nearest bank.
we live in a political world
where courage is a thing of the past
houses are haunted, children are unwanted
the next day could be your last.
we live in a political world.
the one we can see and can feel
but there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
we all know for sure that it's real.
we live in a political world
in the cities of lonesome fear,
little by little you turn in the middle
but you're never why you're here.
we live in a political world
under the microscope,
you can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
you always got more than enough rope.
we live in a political world
turning and a'thrashing about,
as soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
what looks like the easy way out.
we live in a political world
where peace is not welcome at al,
it's turned away from the door to wander some more
or put up against the wall.
we live in apolitical world
everything is hers or his,
climb into the frame and shout god's name
but you're never sure what it is."
"a country dance was being held in a garden
i felt a bump and heard an ""oh, beg your pardon""
suddenly i saw   polka dots and moonbeams
all around a pug nosed dream
the music started, and was i the perplexed one
i held my breathe, and said ""may i have the next one""
in my frightened arms   polka dots and moonbeams
sparkled on a pug nosed dream
there were questions
in the eyes of other dancers
as we floated over the floor
there were questions
but my heart knew all the answers
and perhaps a few things more
now in a cottage, built of lilacs and laughter
i know the meaning, of the words: ""ever after""
and i'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
when i kiss the pug nosed dream"

you know it's not like that
if you're so hurt
why then don't you show it
you say you lost your faith
but that's not where it's at
you had no faith to lose
and you know it
i know the reason
that you talk behind my back

to think i'd make contact
with the one who tries to hide
what he don't know to begin with

you always act surprised
you say, ""how are you?"" ""good luck""

you'd rather see me paralyzed
why don't you just come out once
and scream it
no, i do not feel that good

perhaps i'd rob them

when men will beg god to kill them and they won't be able to die?
sister, lemme tell you about a vision i saw.
you were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law.
you were telling him about buddha, you were telling him about mohammed
in the same breath.
you never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.

what god has given to us no man can take away.
we are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves.
let us hope they've found mercy in their bone filled graves.
you're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
you're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you touch up the night.

on the way out of egypt, through ethiopia, to the judgment hall of christ.

"come around you rovin' gamblers and a story i will tell
about the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
his name was will o' conley and he gambled all his life,
he had twenty seven children, yet he never had a wife.
and it's ride, willie, ride,
roll, willie, roll,
wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
he gambled in the white house and in the railroad yards,
wherever there was people, there was willie and his cards.
he had a reputation as the gamblin'est man around,
wives would keep their husbands home when willie came to town.
and it's ride, willie, ride,
roll, willie, roll,
wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
sailin' down the mississippi to a town called new orleans,
they're still talkin' about their card game on that jackson river queen.
""i've come to win some money,"" gamblin' willie says,
when the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his.
and it's ride, willie, ride,
roll, willie, roll,
wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
up in the rocky mountains in a town called cripple creek,
there was an all night poker game, lasted about a week.
nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
when willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town.
and it's ride, willie, ride,
roll, willie, roll,
wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
but willie had a heart of gold and this i know is true,
he supported all his children, and all their mothers too.
he wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore,
he spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor.
and it's ride, willie, ride,
roll, willie, roll,
wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
when you played your cards with willie, you never really knew
whether he was bluffin' or whether he was true.
he won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair.
the man, he left a diamond flush, willie didn't even have a pair.
and it's ride, willie, ride,
roll, willie, roll,
wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
it was late one evenin' during a poker game,
a man lost all his money, he said willie was to blame.
he shot poor willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
when willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
and it's ride, willie, ride,
roll, willie, roll,
wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
so all you rovin' gamblers, wherever you might be,
the moral of this story is very plain to see.
make your money while you can, before you have to stop,
for when you pull that dead man's hand, your gamblin' days are up.
and it's ride, willie, ride,
roll, willie, roll,
wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody really knows."
"well, i wandered again to my home in the mountain
where in youth's early dawn i was happy and free
i looked for my friends but i never could find them
ev'rybody i met was a rank stranger to me.
ev'rybody i met seemed to be a rank stranger
no mother or dad, not a friend could i see
they knew not my name and i knew not their faces
ev'rybody i met, rank strangers to me.
""well, they all moved away"" said the voice of a stranger
""to some beautiful home on that bright, crystal sea""
some beautiful day, well, i'll meet 'em in heaven
where no one will be a stranger to me.
ev'rybody i met seemed to be a rank stranger
no mother or dad, not a friend could i see
they knew not my name and i knew not their faces
i found they were all rank strangers to me."
"oh all the money that in my whole life i did spend,
be it mine right or wrongfully,
i let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends
to tie up the time most forcefully.
but the bottles are done,
we've killed each one
and the table's full and overflowed.
and the corner sign
says it's closing time,
so i'll bid farewell and be down the road.
oh ev'ry girl that ever l've touched,
i did not do it harmfully.
and ev'ry girl that ever i've hurt,
i did not do it knowin'ly.
but to remain as friends and make amends
you need the time and stay behind.
and since my feet are now fast
and point away from the past,
i'll bid farewell and be down the line.
oh ev'ry foe that ever i faced,
the cause was there before we came.
and ev'ry cause that ever i fought,
i fought it full without regret or shame.
but the dark does die
as the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
must meet the dawn.
and if i see the day
i'd only have to stay,
so i'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
oh, ev'ry thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
i might go insane if it couldn't be sprung.
but it's not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes,
it's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
but the time ain't tall,
yet on time you depend and no word is possessed
by no special friend.
and though the line is cut,
it ain't quite the end,
i'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
to disgrace, distract, and bother me.
and the dirt of gossip blows into my face,
and the dust of rumors covers me.
but if the arrow is straight
and the point is slick,
it can pierce through dust no matter how thick.
so i'll make my stand
and remain as i am
and bid farewell and not give a damn."
"love is a burning thing,
can change into a firy ring.
bound for wild desire
i fell into a ring of fire.
i fell into a burning ring of fire.
i went down down down
and the flames went higher.
and it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire.
they say that love is sweet
when hearts like ours meet.
i fell for you like a child.
oh but the fire went wild.
i fell into a burning ring of fire.
i went down down down
and the flames went higher.
and it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire.
i fell into a burning ring of fire.
i went down down down
and the flames went higher.
and it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire.
i fell into a burning ring of fire.
i went down down down
and the flames they went higher.
and it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire.
and it burns burns burns,
that ring of fire,
that ring of fire."
"ring them bells, ye heathen
from the city that dreams,
ring them bells from the sanctuaries

ring them bells st. peter
where the four winds blow,
ring them bells with an iron hand
so the people will know.

on the wheel and the plow
and the sun is going down
upon the sacred cow.
ring them bells sweet martha,
for the poor man's son,
ring them bells so the world will know
that god is one.
oh the shepherd is asleep
where the willows weep
and the mountains are filled
with lost sheep.
ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
ring them bells for all of us
who are left
ring them bells for the chosen few
who will judge the many
when the game is through.
ring them bells, for the time that flies,
for the child that cries
when innocence dies.

between right and wrong."
"on the banks of the river, where the willows hang down
where the wild birds all warble with a low moaning sound
down in the hollow where the water runs cold
it's there i have listened to the lies that you told
now i lie on my bed and i see your sweet face
the past i remember, time cannot erase
the letters you wrote me were written in shame
and i know that your conscience still echos my pain
now the nights are so long, my sorrow runs deep
nothing is worse than a night without sleep
i walk out alone, i look at the sky
too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry
now if the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were thrushes
i'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
if the ladies were squirrels with them high bushy tails
i'd fill up my shotgun with rock, salt and nails"

your bones are weary
you're about to breathe your last

roll on john, roll through the rain and snow
take the righthand road and go where the buffalo roam

too late now to sail back home

tyger, tyger burning bright
i pray the lord my soul to keep in the forest of the night

i bought a joke, a trick or two,
just to bring and show you,
caught ya with the trickster too.
sometimes i wonder how ya knew
a hypnotist, fancytalker,
ruben remus ain't no doctor
i knew the man and tried to remember
just where it was that i'd seen his face.
long ago, in a movie show,
he was like that man singin' bass.
knew him by his nurs'ry rhyme:
the story of the rabbit man.
fell right in and said to him:
""i'd like to help you if i can.""
i know the film would only shock ya,
ruben remus ain't no doctor!
he only needed what you had,
asked for nothing more,
said he'd like to take you on,
but it's been done before.
you couldn't see he's a travelin' man
and he cannot take your hand.
it's very hard to understand
why his songs were never banned.
guess the man would never knock ya,
ruben remus ain't no doctor!
no one seen ya since he's been gone,
it's been a day, maybe more.
i took a walk in your yard
and knocked on your back door.
why don't you let me in?
i'm not the man who did ya in.
is mr. remus still your friend?
you say you don't remember him.
turn me down, would ya?
well, i've got news for you.

vanity.
as i look around this world all that i'm finding
is the saving grace that's over me.
the wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
there's only one road and it leads to calvary.
it gets discouraging at times, but i know i'll make it
by the saving grace that's over me."
"in scarlet town, where i was born
there's ivy leaf and silver thorn
the streets have names that you can't pronounce
gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
the music starts and the people sway
everybody says, ""are you going my way?""
uncle tom still workin' for uncle bill
scarlet town is under the hill.
scarlet town in the month of may
sweet william holme on his deathbed lay
mistress mary by the side of the bed
kissin' his face and puttin' prayers on his head
so brave and true, so gentle is he
i'll weep for him as he would weep for me
little boy blue come your blow horn
in scarlet town, where i was born
scarlet town, in the hot noon hours,
there's palm leaf shadows and scattered flowers
beggars crouching at the gate
help comes, but it comes too late
by marble slabs and in fields of stone
you make your humble wishes known
i touched the garment, but the hem was torn
in scarlet town, where i was born
in scarlet town, the end is near
the seven wonders of the world are here
the evil and the good livin' side by side
all human forms seem glorified
put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
see who will hold you and kiss you good night
there's walnut groves and maplewood
in scarlet town cryin' won't do no good
in scarlet town, you fight your father's foes
up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
you fight 'em on high and you fight 'em down in
you fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
you've got legs that can drive men mad
a lot of things we didn't do that i wish we had
in scarlet town, the sky is clear
you'll wish to god that you stayed right here
set 'em joe, play ""walkin' the floor""
play it for my flat chested junkie whore
i'm staying up late, i'm making amends
while we smile, all heaven descends
if love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
all things are beautiful in their time
the black and the white, the yellow and the brown
it's all right there in front of you in scarlet town"
"well there's one kind of favor i'll ask for you
well there's one kind of favor i'll ask for you
there's just one kind of favor i'll ask for you
you can see that my grave is kept clean.
and there's two white horses following me
and there's two white horses following me
i got two white horses following me
waiting on my burying ground.
did you ever hear that coffin sound
did you ever hear that coffin sound
did you ever hear that coffin sound
means another poor boy is underground.
did you ever hear them church bells toll
did you ever hear them church bells toll
did you ever hear them church bells toll
means another poor boy is dead and gone.
and my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
and my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
and my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
now i believe what the bible told.
there's just one last favor i'll ask for you
and there's one last favor i'll ask for you
there's just one last favor i'll ask for you
see that my grave is kept clean."
"well, i thought that the rain would cool things down
but it looks like it don't.
i'd like to get you to change your mind
but it looks like you won't.
from now on i'll be busy,
ain't goin' nowhere fast.
i'm just glad it's over
and i'm seeing the real you at last.
well, didn't i risk my neck for you,
didn't i take chances?
didn't i rise above it all for you,
the most unfortunate circumstances?
well, i have had some rotten nights,
didn't think that they would pass.
i'm just thankful and grateful
to be seeing the real you at last.
i'm hungry and i'm irritable
and i'm tired of this bag of tricks.
at one time there was nothing wrong with me
that you could not fix.
well, i sailed through the storm
strapped to the mast,
but the time has come
and i'm seeing the real you at last.
when i met you, baby,
you didn't show no visible scars.
you could ride like annie oakley,
you could shoot like belle starr.
well, i don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble,
trouble always comes to pass
but all i care about now
is that i'm seeing the real you at last.
well, i'm gonna quit this baby talk now,
i guess i should have known.
i got troubles, i think maybe you got troubles,
i think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
whatever you gonna do,
please do it fast.
i'm still trying to get used to
seeing the real you at last."

"i was thinking of a series of dreams
where nothing comes up to the top
everything stays down where it's wounded
and comes to a permanent stop
wasn't thinking of anything specific
like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
nothing too very scientific
just thinking of a series of dreams
thinking of a series of dreams
where the time and the tempo fly
and there's no exit in any direction
'cept the one that you can't see with your eyes
wasn't making any great connection
wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
nothing that would pass inspection
just thinking of a series of dreams
dreams where the umbrella is folded
into the path you are hurled
and the cards are no good that you're holding
unless they're from another world
in one, numbers were burning
in another, i witnessed a crime
in one, i was running, and in another
all i seemed to be doing was climb
wasn't looking for any special assistance
not going to any great extremes
i'd already gone the distance
just thinking of a series of dreams"
"old reilly stole a stallion
but they caught him and they brought him back
and they laid him down on the jailhouse ground
with an iron chain around his neck.
old reilly's daughter got a message
that her father was goin' to hang.
she rode by night and came by morning
with gold and silver in her hand.
when the judge he saw reilly's daughter
his old eyes deepened in his head,
sayin', ""gold will never free your father,
the price, my dear, is you instead.""
""oh i'm as good as dead,"" cried reilly,
""it's only you that he does crave
and my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all.
get on your horse and ride away.""
""oh father you will surely die
if i don't take the chance to try
and pay the price and not take your advice.
for that reason i will have to stay.""
the gallows shadows shook the evening,
in the night a hound dog bayed,
in the night the grounds were groanin',
in the night the price was paid.
the next mornin' she had awoken
to know that the judge had never spoken.
she saw that hangin' branch a bendin',
she saw her father's body broken.
these be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
that one doctor will not save him,
that two healers will not heal him,
that three eyes will not see him.
that four ears will not hear him,
that five walls will not hide him,
that six diggers will not bury him
and that seven deaths shall never kill him."
"seven days, seven more days she'll be comin'
i'll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
seven more days, all i gotta do is survive.

ever since i seen her smile, i ain't forgotten her eyes.
she had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies.
i been good, i been good while i been waitin'
maybe guilty of hesitatin', i just been holdin' on
seven more days, all that'll be gone.
there's kissing in the valley,
thieving in the alley,
fighting every inch of the way.
trying to be tender
with somebody i remember
in a night that's always brighter'n the day.

"i was in another lifetime;
one of toil and blood
when blackness was a virtue
and the road was full of mud.
i come in from the wilderness,
a creature void of form.
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm"".
and if i pass this way again
you can rest assured
i'll always do my best for her,
on that i give my word.
in a world of steel eyed death
and men who are fighting to be warm,
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm"".
not a word was spoke between us.
there was little risk involved.
everything up to that point
had been left unresolved.
try imagining a place where
it's always safe and warm.
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm"".
i was burned out from exhaustion.
buried in the hail.
poisoned in the bushes
and blown out on the trail.
hunted like a crocodile
ravaged in the corn.
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm"".
suddenly i turned around
and she was standing there
with silver bracelets on her wrists
and flowers in her hair.
she walked up to me so gracefully
and took my crown of thorns.
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm"".
now there's a wall between us.
something there's been lost.
i took too much for granted;
got my signals crossed.
just to think that it all began
on a non eventfull morn.
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm"".
well, the deputy walks on hard nails
and the preacher rides a mount,
but nothing really matters much.
it's doom alone that counts
and the one eyed undertaker;
he blows a futile horn.
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm"".
i've heard newborn babies
wailing like a mourning dove
and old men with broken teeth
stranded without love.
do i understand your question, man?
is it hopeless and forlorn?
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm"".
in a little hilltop village
they gambled for my clothes.
i bargained for salvation
and she gave me a lethal dose.
i offered up my innocence
and got repaid with scorn.
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm"".
well, i'm living in a foreign country,
but i'm bound to cross the line.
beauty walks a razor's edge.
someday i'll make it mine.
if i could only turn back the clock
to when god and her were born.
""come in"" she said, ""i'll give you
shelter from the storm""."

and i thought of me.
if i was still the same
if i ever became what you wanted me to be
did i miss the mark or
over step the line
that only you could see?
seen a shooting star tonight
and i thought of me.
listen to the engine, listen to the bell
as the last fire truck from hell
goes rolling by, all good people are praying,

the last account
the last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,

i've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em too.
don't show me no picture show or give me no book to read,
it don't satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds.
i need a shot of love, i need a shot of love.
why would i want to take your life?
you've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
mocked my god, humiliated my friends.

don't wanna be with nobody tonight veronica not around nowhere,

"they sat together in the park
as the evening sky grew dark.
she looked at him and he felt a spark
tingle to his bones.
it was then he felt alone
and wished that he'd gone straight
and watched out for a simple twist of fate.
they walked alone by the old canal.
a little confused, i remember well,
and stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright.
he felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
moving with a simple twist of fate.
a saxophone someplace far off played
as she was walking on by the arcade
as the light bust through a beat up shade
where he was waking up.
she dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
and forgot about a simple twist of fate.
he woke up; the room was bare.
he didn't see her anywhere.
he told himself he didn't care ;pushed the window open wide;
felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
brought on by a simple twist of fate.
he hears the ticking of the clocks
and walks along with a parrot that talks.
hunts her down by the waterfront docks
where the sailers all come in.
maybe she'll pick him out again. how long must he wait
one more time for a simple twist of fate.
people tell me it's a sin
to know and feel too much within.
i still believe she was my twin, but i lost the ring.
she was born in spring, but i was born too late.
blame it on a simple twist of fate."

"skylark
have you anything to say to me
won't you tell me where my love can be
is there a meadow in the mist
where someone's waiting to be kissed
oh skylark
have you seen a valley green with spring
where my heart can go a journeying
over the shadows and the rain
to a blossom covered lane
and in your lonely flight
haven't you heard the music of the night
wonderful music
faint as a will o' the wisp
crazy as a loon
sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
you may hear her laughing across a crowded room
and night after night, as strange as it seems
the sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams
who can explain it, who can tell you why?
fools give you reasons, wise men never try
some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
when you hear her call you across a crowded room
then fly to her side and make her your own

once you have found her, never let her go
once you have found her, never let her go"

so wide and deep

on the bandstand croon
september song, memphis in june
while they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a flaming red wig
i been to babylon
i gotta confess
i can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness
what looks large from a distance, close up is never that big
never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
someone's got a hold of my heart
someone's got a hold of my heart
someone's got a hold of my heart

yeah, you got a hold of my heart"
"something there is about you that strikes a match in me
is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
somethin' that crossed over from another century?
thought i'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
rainy days on the great lakes, walkin' the hills of old duluth.
there was me and danny lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was ruth
something there is about you that brings back a long forgotten truth.
suddenly i found you and the spirit in me sings
don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things.
i could say that i'd be faithful, i could say it in one sweet, easy breath
but to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
something there is about you that moves with style and grace
i was in a whirlwind, now i'm in some better place.
my hand's on the sabre and you've picked up the baton
somethin' there is about you that i can't quite put my finger on."
"something is burning, baby, are you aware?
something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair
are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign
is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
you've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while
the truth that i'm seeking is in your missing file
what's your position, baby, what's going on?
why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
i know everything about this place, or so it seems
am i no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
well, it is so obvious that something has changed
what's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
something is burning, baby, here's what i say
even the bloodhounds of london couldn't find you today
i see the shadow of a man, baby, makin' you blue
who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
we've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins
where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
but where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
i can feel it in the night when i think of you
i can feel it in the light and it's got to be true
you can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied
you can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied
got to start someplace, baby, can you explain?
please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train
answer me, baby, a casual look will do
just what in the world has come over you?
i can feel it in the wind and it's upside down
i can feel it in the dust as i get off the bus on the outskirts of town
i've had the mexico city blues since the last hairpin curve
i don't wanna see you bleed, i know what you need but it ain't what you deserve
something is burning, baby, something's in flames
there's a man going 'round calling names
ring down when you're ready, baby, i'm waiting for you
i believe in the impossible, you know that i do"
"i'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
walkin' a road other men have gone down.
i'm seein' your world of people and things,
your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
hey, hey woody guthrie, i wrote you a song
'bout a funny ol' world that's a comin' along.
seems sick an' it's hungry, it's tired an' it's torn,
it looks like it's a dyin' an' it's hardly been born.
hey, woody guthrie, but i know that you know
all the things that i'm a sayin' an' a many times more.
i'm a singin' you the song, but i can't sing enough,
'cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
here's to cisco an' sonny an' leadbelly too,
an' to all the good people that traveled with you.
here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
that come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
i'm a leaving' tomorrow, but i could leave today,
somewhere down the road someday.
the very last thing that i'd want to do
is to say i've been hittin' some hard travelin' too"
"i'm searching for phrases
to sing your praises
i need to tell someone
it's soon after midnight
and my day has just begun
a gal named honey
took my money
she was passing by
it's soon after midnight
and the moon is in my eye
my heart is cheerful
it's never fearful
i've been down on the killing floors
i'm in no great hurry
i'm not afraid of your fury
i've faced stronger walls than yours
charlotte's a harlot
dresses in scarlet
mary dresses in green
it's soon after midnight
and i've got a date with the fairy queen
they chirp and they chatter
what does it matter?
they lie and dine in their blood
two timing slim
who's every heard of him?
i'll drag his corpse through the mud
it's now or never
more than ever
when i met you id didn't think you do
its soon after midnight
and i don't want nobody but you"
"gypsy gal, the hands of harlem
cannot hold you to its heat.
your temperature's too hot for taming,
your flaming feet burn up the street.
i am homeless, come and take me
into reach of your rattling drums.
let me know, babe, about my fortune
down along my restless palms.
gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
i have fallen far beneath
your pearly eyes, so fast an' slashing,
an' your flashing diamond teeth.
the night is pitch black, come an' make my
pale face fit into place, ah, please!
let me know, babe, i got to know, babe,
if it's you my lifelines trace.
i been wond'rin' all about me
ever since i seen you there.
on the cliffs of your wildcat charms i'm riding,
i know i'm 'round you but i don't know where.
you have slayed me, you have made me,
i got to laugh halfways off my heels.
i got to know, babe, will i be touching you
so i can tell if i'm really real."
"broke my heart, lost my soul
adios,mi cora sole
spanish is the loving tongue
soft as music, light as spring
it was a girl i learned it from
living down sonora way
well, i don't look much like a lover
still i say her love words over
mostly when i'm all alone
mi amor, mi cora sole.
haven't seen her since that night
i can't cross the line you know
they want me for a gamblin' fight
like as not it's better so
still i always kind of missed her
since that last sad night i kissed her
broke her heart, lost my own
adios, mi cora sole
broke her heart, lost my own
adios, mi cora sole
adios, mi cora sole
adios, mi cora sole."
"spirit on the water
darkness on the face of the deep
i keep thinking about you baby
i can't hardly sleep
i'm traveling by land
traveling through the dawn of day
you're always on my mind
i can't stay away
i'd forgotten about you
then you turned up again
i always knew
we were meant to be more than friends
when you're near
it's just as plain as it can be
i'm wild about you, gal
you ought to be a fool about me
can't explain
the sources of this hidden pain
you burned your way into my heart
you got the key to my brain
i've been trampling through mud
praying to the powers above
i'm sweating blood
you got a face that begs for love
life without you
doesn't mean a thing to me
if i can't have you
i'll throw my love into the deep blue sea
sometimes i wonder
why you can't treat me right
you do good all day
and then you do wrong all night
when you're with me
i'm a thousand times happier than i could ever say
what does it matter
what price i pay
they brag about your sugar
brag about it all over town
put some sugar in my bowl
i feel like laying down
i'm as pale as a ghost
holding a blossom on a stem
you ever seen a ghost? no
but you have heard of them
i see you there
i'm blinded by the colors i see
i take good care
of what belongs to me
i hear your name
ringing up and down the line
i'm saying it plain
these ties are strong enough to bind
now your sweet voice
calls out from some old familiar shrine
i got no choice
can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind
i could live forever
with you perfectly
you don't ever
have to make a fuss over me
from east to west
ever since the world began
i only mean it for the best
i want to be with you any way i can
i been in a brawl
now i'm feeling the wall
i'm going away baby
i won't be back 'til fall
high on the hill
you can carry all my thoughts with you
you've numbed my will
this love could tear me in two
i wanna be with you in paradise
and it seems so unfair
i can't go to paradise no more
i killed a man back there
you think i'm over the hill
you think i'm past my prime
let me see what you got
we can have a whoppin' good time"

jukebox playing low
yesterday everything was going too fast
today, it's moving too slow
i got no place left to turn
i got nothing left to burn
don't know if i saw you, if i would kiss you or kill you
it probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
you left me standing in the doorway, crying
i got nothing to go back to now
the light in this place is so bad
making me sick in the head
all the laughter is just making me sad
the stars have turned cherry red
i'm strumming on my g** guitar
smoking a cheap cigar
the ghost of our old love has not gone away
don't look like it will anytime soon
you left me standing in the doorway crying
under the midnight moon
maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
but not tonight and it won't be here
there are things i could say but i don't
i know the mercy of god must be near
i've been riding the midnight train
got ice water in my veins
i would be crazy if i took you back
it would go up against every rule
you left me standing in the doorway, crying
suffering like a fool
when the last rays of daylight go down
buddy, you'll roll no more
i can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
i wonder who they're ringing for
i know i can't win
but my heart just won't give in
last night i danced with a stranger
but she just reminded me you were the one
you left me standing in the doorway crying
in the dark land of the sun
i'll eat when i'm hungry, drink when i'm dry
and live my life on the square
and even if the flesh falls off of my face
i know someone will be there to care
it always means so much
even the softest touch
i see nothing to be gained by any explanation
there are no words that need to be said

blues wrapped around my head"

an' it strangled up my mind,
an' now people just get uglier
an' i have no sense of time.
oh, mama, can this really be the end,
to be stuck inside of mobile
with the memphis blues again.
when ruthie says come see her
in her honky tonk lagoon,
where i can watch her waltz for free
'neath her panamanian moon.
an' i say, ""aw come on now,
you must know about my debutante.""
an' she says, ""your debutante just knows what you need
but i know what you want.""
oh, mama, can this really be the end,
to be stuck inside of mobile
with the memphis blues again.
now the bricks lay on grand street
where the neon madmen climb.
they all fall there so perfectly,
it all seems so well timed.
an' here i sit so patiently
waiting to find out what price
you have to pay to get out of
going through all these things twice.
oh, mama, can this really be the end,
to be stuck inside of mobile
with the memphis blues again."

i've got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense

the ladies down in darktown, they're doin' the darktown strut
y'always got to be prepared, but you never know for what
there ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing
sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow
you went years without me, might as well keep goin' now
every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
any minute of the day, the bubble can burst
try to make things better for someone sometimes you just end up makin' it thousand times worse
sugar baby get on down the road, you ain't got no brains nohow
you went years without me, might as well keep goin' now
your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
you got a way of tearin' the world apart, love, see what you've done
just as sure as we're livin', just as sure as you're born

by the way, that's a cute hat,
and that smile's so hard to resist
but what's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
you know, i once knew a woman who looked like you,
she wanted a whole man, not just a half,
she used to call me sweet daddy when i was only a child,
you kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
in order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear,
it's done with a flick of the wrist.
what's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
you know, a woman like you should be at home,
that's where you belong,
watching out for someone who loves you true
who would never do you wrong.
just how much abuse will you be able to take?
well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
what's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
you know you can make a name for yourself,
you can hear them tires squeal,
you can be known as the most beautiful woman
who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
you know, news of you has come down the line
even before ya came in the door.
they say in your father's house, there's many mansions
each one of them got a fireproof floor.
snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you,
they smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
what's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
got to have done some evil deed,
got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
they say that patriotism is the last refuge
to which a scoundrel clings.
steal a little and they throw you in jail,
steal a lot and they make you king.
there's only one step down from here, baby,
it's called the land of permanent bliss.
what's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?"
"well my nerves are exploding and my body's tense

i thought it would rain but the clouds passed by

i don't know what i'm gonna do

"one time in london i'd gone out for a walk,
past a place called hyde park where people talk
'bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view
to anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
there was someone on a platform talking to the folks
about the t.v. god and all the pain that it invokes.
""it's too bright a light"", he said, ""for anybody's eyes,
if you've never seen one it's a blessing in disguise.""
i moved in closer, got up on my toes,
two men in front of me were coming to blows
the man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
""the news of the day is on all the time,
all the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme,
your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see.""
""pray for peace!"". he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
my thoughts began to wander. his voice was ringing loud,
""it will destroy your family, your happy home is gone
no one can protect you fro it once you turn it on.""
""it will led you into some strange pursuits,
lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
it will scramble up your head and drag your brain about,
sometimes you gotta do like elvis did and shoot the damn thing out.""
""it's all been designed"", he said, ""to make you lose your mind,
and when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.""
""everytime you look at it, your situation's worse,
if you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse.""
the crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
there was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran.
the t.v. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me,
later on that evening, i watched it on t.v.."
"these are the words of a frontier man
who lost his love when he turned bad.

tell her that my ship set sail
you can say she'd better not wait for me
but don't tell her i'm in jail, oh don't tell her i'm in jail.
take a message to mary
but don't tell her what i've done
please, don't mention the stage coach
and the shot from a carried gun
you better tell her that i had to change my plans
and cancel out the wedding day
but please, don't mention the lonely cell
where i'm gonna pine away, until my dying day.
take a message to mary
but don't tell her all you know

"why must you always try to make me over ?
take me as i am or let me go
white lilies never grow on stalks of clover
take me as i am or let me go.

i won't be a stand in for an old love
take me as i am or let me go.
you've tried to change me ever since you've met me
take me as i am or let me go.

"here's a foreign song i learned in utah
ha va ne gei lah

"well, i was feelin' sad and feelin' blue,
i didn't know what in the world i was gonna do,
them communists they wus comin' around,
they wus in the air,
they wus on the ground.
they wouldn't gimme no peace. .
so i run down most hurriedly
and joined up with the john birch society,
i got me a secret membership card
and started off a walkin' down the road.
yee hoo, i'm a real john bircher now!
look out you commies!
now we all agree with hitlers' views,
although he killed six million jews.
it don't matter too much that he was a fascist,
at least you can't say he was a communist!
that's to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria.
well, i wus lookin' everywhere for them gol darned reds.
i got up in the mornin' 'n' looked under my bed,
looked in the sink, behind the door,
looked in the glove compartment of my car.
couldn't find 'em . .
i wus lookin' high an' low for them reds everywhere,
i wus lookin' in the sink an' underneath the chair.
i looked way up my chimney hole,
i even looked deep inside my toilet bowl.
they got away . .
well, i wus sittin' home alone an' started to sweat,
figured they wus in my t.v. set.
peeked behind the picture frame,
got a shock from my feet, hittin' right up in the brain.
them reds caused it!
i know they did . . them hard core ones.
well, i quit my job so i could work alone,
then i changed my name to sherlock holmes.
followed some clues from my detective bag
and discovered they wus red stripes on the american flag!
that ol' betty ross . .
well, i investigated all the books in the library,
ninety percent of 'em gotta be burned away.
i investigated all the people that i knowed,
ninety eight percent of them gotta go.
the other two percent are fellow birchers . . just like me.
now eisenhower, he's a russian spy,
lincoln, jefferson and that roosevelt guy.
to my knowledge there's just one man
that's really a true american: george lincoln rockwell.
i know for a fact he hates commies cus he picketed the movie exodus.
well, i fin'ly started thinkin' straight
when i run outa things to investigate.
couldn't imagine doin' anything else,
so now i'm sittin' home investigatin' myself!
hope i don't find out anything . . hmm, great god!"
"some time ago a crazy dream came to me,
i dreamt i was walkin' into world war three,
i went to the doctor the very next day
to see what kinda words he could say.
he said it was a bad dream.
i wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though,
they were my own dreams and they're only in my head.
i said, ""hold it, doc, a world war passed through my brain""
he said, ""nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane""
he grabbed my arm, i said, ""ouch!""
as i landed on the psychiatric couch
he said, ""tell me about it""
well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast,
it was all over by quarter past.
i was down in the sewer with some little lover
when i peeked out from a manhole cover
wondering who turned the lights on.
well, i got up and walked around
and up and down the lonesome town.
i stood a wondering which way to go,
i lit a cigarette on a parking meter
and walked on down the road.
it was a normal day.
well, i rung the fallout shelter bell
and i leaned my head and i gave a yell,
""give me a string bean, i'm a hungry man.""
a shotgun fired and away i ran.
i don't blame them too much though,
i know i look funny.
down at the corner by a hot dog stand
i seen a man, i said, ""howdy friend,
i guess there's just us two.""
he screamed a bit and away he flew.
thought i was a communist.
well, i spied a girl and before she could leave,
""let's go and play adam and eve.""
i took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
when she said, ""hey man, you crazy or sumpin',
you see what happened last time they started.""
well, i seen a cadillac window uptown
and there was nobody aroun',
i got into the driver's seat
and i drove 42nd street
in my cadillac.
good car to drive after a war.
well, i remember seein' some ad,
so i turned on my conelrad.
but i didn't pay my con ed bill,
so the radio didn't work so well.
turned on my player 
it was rock a day, johnny singin',
""tell your ma, tell your pa,
our loves are gonna grow ooh wah, ooh wah.""
i was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue,
i needed somebody to talk to.
so i called up the operator of time
just to hear a voice of some kind.
""when you hear the beep
it will be three o'clock,""
she said that for over an hour
and i hung it up.
well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
sayin, ""hey i've been havin' the same old dreams,
but mine was a little different you see.
i dreamt that the only person left after the war was me.
i didn't see you around.""
well, now time passed and now it seems
everybody's having them dreams
everybody sees themselves
walkin' around with no one else
half of the people can be part right all of the time
some of the people can be all right part of the time
but all of the people can't be all right all of the time
i think abraham lincoln said that
""i'll let you be in my dreams if i can be in yours""
i said that"
"i saw it advertised one day,
bear mountain picnic was comin' my way.
""come along 'n' take a trip,
we'll bring you up there on a ship.
bring the wife and kids
bring the whole family.""
yippee!
well, i run right down 'n' bought a ticket
to this bear mountain picnic.
but little did i realize
i was in for a picnic surprise.
had nothin' to do with mountains.
i didn't even come close to a bear.
took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier,
six thousand people there,
everybody had ticket for the trip.
""oh well."" i said, ""it's a pretty big ship.
besides, anyway, the more the merrier.""
well, we all got on 'n' what d'ya think,
that big old boat started t' sink
more people kept a pilin' on,
that old ship was a slowly goin' down.
funny way t' start a picnic.
well, i soon lost track of m' kids 'n' wife,
so many people there i never saw in m' life
that old ship sinkin' down in the water,
six thousand people tryin' t' kill each other,
dogs a barkin', cats a meowin',
women screamin', fists a flyin', babies cryin',
cops a comin', me a runnin'.
maybe we just better call off the picnic.
i got shoved down 'n' pushed around,
all i could hear there was a screamin' sound,
don't remember one thing more,
just remember walkin' up on a little shore,
head busted, stomach cracked,
feet splintered, i was bald, naked. .
quite lucky to be alive though.
feelin' like i climbed outa m' casket,
i grabbed back hold of m' picnic basket.
took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home,
wishin' i'd never got up that morn.
now, i don't care just what you do,
if you wanta have a picnic, that's up t' you.
but don't tell me about it, i don't wanta hear it,
'cause, see, i just lost all m' picnic spirit.
stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic. .
in the bathroom.
now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
what some people are gonna do f'r money.
there's a bran' new gimmick every day
just t' take somebody's money away.
i think we oughta take some o' these people
and put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to bear mountain . .
for a picnic."
"ramblin' outa the wild west
leavin' the towns i love the best
thought i'd seen some ups and down
""til i come into new york town
people goin' down to the ground
buildings goin' up to the sky
wintertime in new york town
the wind blowin' snow around
walk around with nowhere to go
somebody could freeze right to the bone
i froze right to the bone
new york times said
it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
i didn't feel so cold then
i swung on to my old guitar
grabbed hold of a subway car
and after a rocking, reeling,
rolling ride
i landed up on the downtown side
greenwich village
i walked down there and ended up
in one of them coffee houses on the block
got on the stage to sing and play
man there said, ""come back some other day
you sound like a hillbilly
we want folk singer here""
well, i got a harmonica job
begun to play
blowin' my lungs out for a dollar a day
i blowed inside out and upside down
the man there said he loved m' sound
he was ravin' about how he loved m' sound
dollar a day's worth
and after weeks and weeks of hangin' around
i finally got a job in new york town
in a bigger place, bigger money too
even joined the union and paid m' dues
now, a very great man once said
that some people rob you with a fountain pen
it didn't take too long to find out
just what he was talkin' about
a lot of people don't have much food
on their table
but they got a lot of forks n' knives
and they gotta cut somethin'
so one mornin' when the sun was warm
i rambled out of new york town
pulled my cap down over my eyes
and headed out for the western skies
so long, new york
howdy, east orange"
"early one morning the sun was shining.
i was laying in bed
wondering if she'd changed it all.
if her hair was still red.
her folks, they said, our lives together
sure was gonna be rough.
they never did like mama's homemade dress.
papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
and i was standing on the side of the road,
rain falling on my shoes,
heading out for the east coast.
lord knows i've paid some dues getting through,
tangled up in blue.
she was married when we first met.
soon to be divorced.
i helped her out of a jam, i guess,
but i used a little too much force.
we drove that car as far as we could;
abandoned it out west.
split it up on a dark sad night;
both agreeing it was best.
she turned around to look at me
as i was walking away.
i heard her say over my shoulder
""we'll meet again someday on the avenue.""
tangled up in blue.
i had a job in the great north woods
working as a cook for a spell,
but i never did like it all that much
and one day the axe just fell.
so i drifted down to new orleans
where i happened to be employed
working for a while on a fishing boat
right outside of delacroix,
but all the while i was alone.
the past was close behind.
i seen a lot of women,
but she never escaped my mind and i just grew
tangled up in blue.
she was working in a topless place
and i stopped in for a beer.
i just kept looking at the side of her face
in the spotlight so clear
and later on as the crowd thinned out
i's just about to do the same,
she was standing there in back of my chair.
said to me ""don't i know your name?""
i muttered something underneath my breath.
she studied the lines on my face.
i must admit i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe.
tangled up in blue.
she lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
""i thought you'd never say hello,"" she said,
""you look like the silent type.""
then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me.
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
and every one of them words rang true
and glowed like burning coal
pouring off of every page
like it was written in my soul from me to you
tangled up in blue.
i lived with them on montague street
in a basement down the stairs.
there was music in the cafe's at night
and revolution in the air.
then he started into dealing with slaves
and something inside of him died.
she had to sell everything she owned
and froze up inside
and when finally the bottom fell out,
i became withdrawn.
the only thing i knew how to do
was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue.
so now i'm going back again.
i got to get her somehow.
all the people we used to know;
they're an illusion to me now.
some are mathematicians.
some are carpenter's wives.
don't know how it all got started.
i don't what they're doing with their lives,
but me, i'm still on the road
heading for another joint.
we always did feel the same.
we just saw it from a different point of view.
tangled up in blue."
"i buyed me a little dog
color it was brown
i learned him how to whistle
sing and dance and run
his legs they were 14 yards long
his ears they were quite broad
around the world in a half a day
and on him i could ride
sing tattle o? day
i buyed me a little bull
about four inches high
everybody feared him
that ever heard him cry
when he begins to bellow
it made such a melodious sound
and all the walls in london town
came tumbling to the ground
sing tattle o? day
i buyed me a flock of sheep
i thought they were all weathers
sometimes they yield at wolves
sometimes they yield at feathers
i think mine are the very best sheep
for yielding increase
for every full change of the moon
they bring both lambs and geese
sing tattle o? day
i buyed me a little box
about four acres square
i filled it full of guineas
and silver so fair
oh now i? m bound for turkey
i travel like an ox
and in my big chest pocket
i carry my little box
sing tattle o? day
i buyed me a little hen
all speckled g** and fair
i sat her on an oyster shell
she hatched me out a hare
the hare it sprang a handsome horse
blew fifteen hens high
and him that tells a bigger tale
would have to tell a lie
sing tattle o? day"
"we carried you in our arms
on independence day,
and now you'd throw us all aside
and put us on our way.
oh what dear daughter 'neath the sun
would treat a father so,
to wait upon him hand and foot
and always tell him, ""no""?
tears of rage, tears of grief,
why must i always be the thief?
come to me now, you know
we're so alone
and life is brief.
we pointed out the way to go
and scratched your name in sand,
though you just thought it was nothing more
than a place for you to stand.
now, i want you to know that while we watched,
you discover there was no one true.
most ev'rybody really thought
it was a childish thing to do.
tears of rage, tears of grief,
must i always be the thief?
come to me now, you know
we're so low
and life is brief.
it was all very painless
when you went out to receive
all that false instruction
which we never could believe.
and now the heart is filled with gold
as if it was a purse.
but, oh, what kind of love is this
which goes from bad to worse?
tears of rage, tears of grief,
must i always be the thief?
come to me now, you know
we're so low
and life is brief."
"tell me, i've got to know.
tell me, tell me before i go.
does that flame still burn? does that fire still glow?
or has it died out and melted like the snow.
tell me.
tell me.
tell me, what are you focused upon?
tell me what i'll know better when you're gone.
tell me quick with a glance on the side.
shall i hold you close?
or shall i let you go by?
tell me.
tell me.
are you looking at me and thinking of somebody else?
can you feel the heat and the beat of my pulse?
do you have any secrets that will come out in time?
do you lie in bed and stare at the stars?
is your main friend an acquaintance of ours?
tell me.
tell me.
tell me, do those neon lights blind your eyes?
tell me, behind what door your treasure lies.
ever gone broke in a big way?
ever gone the opposite of what the experts say?
tell me.
tell me.
is it some kind of game that you're playin' with me.
am i imagining something that never can be?
do you have any morals?
do you have any point of view?
do you long to ride on that old ship of zion?
what means more to you, a lap dog or a dead lion?
tell me.
tell me.
tell me, is my name in your book?
tell me, should i come back and take another look?
tell me the truth, tell me no lies.
are you someone, anyone?
tell me.
tell me."
"i have heard rumors all over town,
they say that you're planning to put me down.
all i would like you to do, is tell me that it isn't true.
they say that you've been seen with some other man,
that he's tall, dark and handsome, and you're holding his hand.
darlin', i'm a countin' on you,
tell me that it isn't true.
to know that some other man is holdin' you tight,
it hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
all of those awful things that i have heard,
i don't want to believe them, all i want is your word.
so darlin', you better come through,
tell me that it isn't true.
all of those awful things that i have heard,
i don't want to believe them, all i want is your word.
so darlin', i'm countin' on you,
tell me that it isn't true."
"0l' black bascom, don't break no mirrors
cold black water dog, make no tears
you say you love me with what may be love
don't you remember makin' baby love?
got your steam drill built and you're lookin' for some kid
to get it to work for you like your nine pound hammer did
but i know that you know that i know that you show
something is tearing up your mind.
tell me, momma,
tell me, momma,
tell me, momma, what is it?
what's wrong with you this time?
hey, john, come and get me some candy goods
shucks, it sure feels like it's in the woods
spend some time on your january trips
you got tombstone moose up and your brave yard whips
if you're anxious to find out when your friendship's gonna end
come on, baby, i'm your friend!
and i know that you know that i know that you show
something is tearing up your mind.
tell me, momma,

ohh, we bone the editor, can't get read

but i can't tell just how far away you are from the edge
and, anyway, you're just gonna make people jump and roar
whatcha wanna go and do that for?
for i know that you know that i know that you know
something is tearing up your mind.
ah, tell me, momma,
tell me, momma,
tell me, momma, what is it?
what's wrong with you this time?"
"the river whispers in my ear
i've hardly a penny to my name
the heavens have never seemed so near
all my body glows with flame
the tempest struggles in the air
and to myself alone i sing
it could sink me then and there
i can hear the echoes ring
i tried to find one smilin' face
to drive the shadow from my head
i'm stranded in this nameless place
lyin' restless in a heavy bed
tell me straight out if you will
why must you torture me within?
why must you come down off your high hill?
throw my fate to the clouds and wind
far away in a silent land
secret thoughts are hard to bear
remember me you'll understand
emotions we can never share
you trampled on me as you passed
left the coldest kiss upon my brow
all my doubts and fears have gone at last
i've nothing more to tell you now
i walk by tranquil lakes and streams
as each new season's dawn awaits
i lay awake at night with troubled dreams
the enemy is at the gate
beneath the thunder blasted trees
the words are ringin' off your tongue
the ground is hard in times like these
stars are cold, the night is young
the rocks are bleak, the trees are bare
iron clouds go floatin' by
snowflakes falling in my hair
beneath the gray and stormy sky
the evenin' sun is sinking low
the woods are dark, the town is too
they''ll drag you down, they run the show
ain't no tellin' what they'll do
tell ol' bill when he comes home
anything is worth a try
tell him that i'm not alone
that the hour has come to do or die
all the world i would defy
let me make it plain as day
i look at you now and i sigh
how could it be any other way?"
"the pale moon rose explainin it's glory
out on the western town
she told a sad, sad story
of the great ship that went down
t'was the fourteenth day of april
over the waves she rode
sailing into tomorrow
to a golden age foretold
the night was black with starlight
the seas were sharp and clear
moving through the shadows
the promised hour was near
lights were holding steady
gliding over the foam
all the lords and ladies
heading for their eternal home
the chandeliers were swaying
from the balustrades above
the orchestra was playing
songs of faded love
the watchman, he lay dreaming
as the ballroom dancers twirled
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
into the underworld
leo took his sketchbook
he was often so inclined
he closed his eyes and painted
the scenery in his mind
cupid struck his bosom
and broke it with a snap
the closest woman to him
he fell into her lap
he heard a loud commotion
something sounded wrong
his inner spirit was saying
that he couldn?t stand here long
he staggered to the quarterdeck
no time now to sleep
water on the quarterdeck
already three foot deep
smokestack was leaning sideways
heavy feet began to pound
he walked into the whirlwind
sky splitting all around
the ship was going under
the universe had opened wide
the roll was called up yonder
the angels turned aside
lights down in the hallway
flickering dim and dull
dead bodies already floating
in the double bottom hull
the engines then exploded
propellers they failed to start
the boilers overloaded
the ship's bow split apart
passengers were flying
backward, forward, far and fast
they mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
each one more weary than the last
the veil was torn asunder
'tween the hours of twelve and one
no change, no sudden wonder
could undo what had been done
the watchman lay there dreaming
at fourtyfive degrees
he dreamed that the titanic was sinking
dropping to her knees
wellington he was sleeping
his bed began to slide
his valiant heart was beating
he pushed the tables aside
glass of shattered crystal
lay scattered roundabout
he strapped on both his pistols
how long could he hold out?
his men and his companions
were nowhere to be seen
in silence there he waited for
time and space to intervene
the passageway was narrow
there was blackness in the air
he saw every kind of sorrow
heard voices everywhere
alarm bells were ringing
to hold back the swelling tide
friends and lovers clinging
to each other side by side
mothers and their daughters
descending down the stairs
jumped into the icy waters
love and pity sent their prayers
the rich man, mister astor
kissed his darling wife
he had no way of knowing
it'd be the last trip of his life
calvin, blake and wilson
gambled in the dark
not one of them would ever live to
tell the tale on the disembark
brother rose up 'gainst brother
in every circumstance
they fought and slaughtered each other
in a deadly dance
they lowered down the lifeboats
from the sinking wreck
there were traitors, there were turncoats
broken backs and broken necks
the bishop left his cabin
to help others in need
turned his eyes up to the heavens
said, ""the poor are yours to feed""
davey the brothel keeper
came out dismissed his girls
saw the water getting deeper
saw the changing of his world
jim dandy smiled
he never learned to swim
saw the little crippled child
and he gave his seat to him
he saw the starlight shining
streaming from the east
death was on the rampage
but his heart was now at peace
the battened down the hatches
but the hatches wouldn?t hold
they drowned upon the staircase
of brass and polished gold
leo said to cleo
i think i?m going mad
but he?d lost his mind already
whatever mind he had
he tried to block the doorway
to save all those from harm
blood from an open wound
pouring down his arm
petals fell from flowers
?til all of them were gone
in the long and dreadful hours
the wizard's curse played on
the host was pouring brandy
he was going down slow
he stayed right to the end and he
was the last to go
there were many, many others
nameless here forever more
they never sailed the ocean
or left their homes before
the watchman, he lay dreaming
the damage had been done
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
and he tried to tell someone
the captain, barely breathing
kneeling at the wheel
above him and beneath him
fifty thousand tons of steel
he looked over at his compass
and he gazed into its face
needle pointing downward
he knew he lost the race
in the dark illumination
he remembered bygone years
he read the book of revelation
and he filled his cup with tears
when the reaper's task had ended
sixteen hundred had gone to rest
the good, the bad, the rich, the poor
the loveliest and the best
they waited at the landing
and they tried to understand
but there is no understanding
on the judgement of god's hand
the news came over the wires
and struck with deadly force
love had lost its fires
all things had run their course
the watchman he lay dreaming
of all the things that can be
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
into the deep blue sea"
"standing on your window, honey,
yes, i've been here before.
feeling so harmless,
i'm looking at your second door.
how come you don't send me no regards?
you know i want your lovin',
honey, why are you so hard?
kneeling 'neath your ceiling,
yes, i guess i'll be here for a while.
i'm tryin' to read your portrait, but,
i'm helpless, like a rich man's child.
how come you send someone out to have me barred?
you know i want your lovin',
honey, why are you so hard?
like a poor fool in his prime,
yes, i know you can hear me walk,
but is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime,
or is it just solid rock?
well, i rush into your hallway,
lean against your velvet door.
i watch upon your scorpion
who crawls across your circus floor.
just what do you think you have to guard?
you know i want your lovin', honey, but you're so hard.
achilles is in your alleyway,
he don't want me here,
he does brag.
he's pointing to the sky
and he's hungry, like a man in drag.
how come you get someone like him to be your guard?
you know i want your lovin',
honey. but you're so hard."
"up in the mornin', out on the job
work like the devil for my pay
but that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
but roll around heaven all day
fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
sweat till i'm wrinkled and gray
while that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
but roll around heaven all day
good lord, up above, can't you know i'm cryin'
tears all in my eyes?
send down that cloud with a silver linin'
lift me to paradise
show me that river, take me across
and wash all my troubles away
like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do
but roll around heaven all day
good lord above, can't you know i'm cryin'

"that old black magic has me in its spell
that old black magic that you weave so well
those icy fingers up and down my spine
the same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
the same old tingle that i feel inside
and then that elevator starts its slide
down and down i go
round and round i go
like a leaf that's caught in the tide
i should stay away but what can i do
i hear your name, and i'm aflame
a flame with such a burning desire
that only your kiss can put out the fire
'cause you're the lover i have waited for
you're mate that fate had me created for
and every time you lips meet mine
baby darling, down and down i go
round and round i go
in that spin of love that i am in
under that old black magic of love
in that spin, loving the spin i am in
under that old black magic of love
in that spin, loving the spin i am in
under that old black magic of love
i should stay away but what can i do
i hear your name, and i'm aflame
a flame burning desire
that only your kiss can put out the fire

you're the mate that fate had me created for
and every time you lips meet mine

oh, in that spin, loving the spin i am in
under that old black of love
in that spin, loving the spin i'm in
under that old black of love
under that old black magic of love"
"a hungry feelin' came o'er me stealin'
as the mice were squeelin' in my prison cell
and that auld triangle, oh it jingle jangle
all along the banks of the royal canal
to begin the morning with the water boilin'
""get out of bed, clean up your cell. ""
and that auld triangle goes jingle jangle
all along the banks of the royal canal
on a fine spring evenin' the lake lay dreamin'
the sea gulls beamin' high above the wall
and that auld triangle goes jingle jangle
all along the banks of the royal canal
the screw was peepin' and the lake lay sleepin'
as he lays there weepin' for his good gal sal
and that auld triangle play jingle jangle
all along the banks of the royal canal
in the female prison there are seventy women
and it took all of them where i'd like to dwell
and that auld triangle would go jingle jangle
all along the banks of the royal canal
oh the day was dyin' and the lake was sighin'
as i lay cryin' in my prison cell

"well, frankie lee and judas priest,
they were the best of friends.
so when frankie lee needed money one day,
judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
and placed them on a footstool
just above the plotted plain,
sayin', ""take your pick, frankie boy,
my loss will be your gain.""
well, frankie lee, he sat right down
and put his fingers to his chin,
but with the cold eyes of judas on him,
his head began to spin.
""would ya please not stare at me like that,"" he said,
""it's just my foolish pride,
but sometimes a man must be alone
and this is no place to hide.""
well, judas, he just winked and said,
""all right, i'll leave you here,
but you'd better hurry up and choose
which of those bills you want,
before they all disappear.""
""i'm gonna start my pickin' right now,
just tell me where you'll be.""
judas pointed down the road
and said, ""eternity!""
""eternity?"" said frankie lee,
with a voice as cold as ice.
""that's right,"" said judas priest, ""eternity,
though you might call it 'paradise.'""
""i don't call it anything,""
said frankie lee with a smile.
""all right,"" said judas priest,
""i'll see you after a while.""
well, frankie lee, he sat back down,
feelin' low and mean,
when just then a passing stranger
burst upon the scene,
saying, ""are you frankie lee, the gambler,
whose father is deceased?
well, if you are,
there's a fellow callin' you down the road
and they say his name is priest.""
""oh, yes, he is my friend,""
said frankie lee in fright,
""i do recall him very well,
in fact, he just left my sight.""
""yes, that's the one,"" said the stranger,
as quiet as a mouse,
""well, my message is, he's down the road,
stranded in a house.""
well, frankie lee, he panicked,
he dropped ev'rything and ran
until he came up to the spot
where judas priest did stand.
""what kind of house is this,"" he said,
""where i have come to roam?""
""it's not a house,"" said judas priest,
""it's not a house . . it's a home.""
well, frankie lee, he trembled,
he soon lost all control
over ev'rything which he had made
while the mission bells did toll.
he just stood there staring
at that big house as bright as any sun,
with four and twenty windows
and a woman's face in ev'ry one.
well, up the stairs ran frankie lee
with a soulful, bounding leap,
and, foaming at the mouth,
he began to make his midnight creep.
for sixteen nights and days he raved,
but on the seventeenth he burst
into the arms of judas priest,
which is where he died of thirst.
no one tried to say a thing
when they took him out in jest,
except, of course, the little neighbor boy
who carried him to rest.
and he just walked along, alone,
with his guilt so well concealed,
and muttered underneath his breath,
""nothing is revealed.""
well, the moral of the story,
the moral of this song,
is simply that one should never be
where one does not belong.
so when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin',
help him with his load,
and don't go mistaking paradise
for that home across the road."
"gather round you people and a story i will tell
about a brave young indian you should remember well
from the tribe of pima indians, a proud and a peaceful band
they farmed the phoenix valley in arizona land
down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
now ira's folks were hungry and their farms wene crops of weeds
but when war came he volunteers and forgot, the white man's greed
call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war
yes, call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war.
they started up iwo jima hill, 250 men
but only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again
and when the fight was over and the old glory raised
one of the men who held it high was the indian ira hayes
call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war
call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war.
now ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land
he was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
but he was just a pima indian, no money crops, no chance
and at home nobody cared what ira had done and the wind did the indian's
dance
call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war
call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war.
and ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
they let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone
he died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save
two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for ira hayes
call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war
yes, call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war.
yes, call him, drunken ira hayes, but his land is still as dry
and his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where ira died
call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war
yes, call him, drunken ira hayes, he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian or the marine who went to war."
"i'm just a poor boy
though my story's seldom told
i have squadered my resistance
for a pocketful of numbles
such are promises, all lies and jest
still a man hears what he wants to hear
and disregards the rest.
when i left my home and family
i was no more than a boy
in the company of strangers
in the quiet of the railway station
running scared, laying low
seeking out the poorer quarters
where the ragged people go
looking for the places only they would know.
asking only workman's wages
i come looking for a job
but i get no offers
just a come on from the whores on seventh avenue
i do declare
there were times when i was so lonesome
i took some comfort there.
then i'm laying out my winter clothes
and wishing i was gone, going home
where the new york city winters aren't bleeding me
leading me
going home.
in the clearing stands a boxer
and a fighter by his trade
and he carries the reminders
of every glove that laid him down
and cut him till he cried out
in his anger and his shame
""i am leaving, i am leaving""
but the fighter still remains."

"william zanzinger killed poor hattie carroll
with a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
at a baltimore hotel society gath'rin'.
and the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
as they rode him in custody down to the station
and booked william zanzinger for first degree murder.
but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
take the rag away from your face.
now ain't the time for your tears.
william zanzinger, who at twenty four years
owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
with rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
and high office relations in the politics of maryland,
reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
and swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling,
in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking.
but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
take the rag away from your face.
now ain't the time for your tears.
hattie carroll was a maid of the kitchen.
she was fifty one years old and gave birth to ten children
who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
and never sat once at the head of the table
and didn't even talk to the people at the table
who just cleaned up all the food from the table
and emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
that sailed through the air and came down through the room,
doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle.
and she never done nothing to william zanzinger.
but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
take the rag away from your face.
now ain't the time for your tears.
in the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
to show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
and that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
and that even the nobles get properly handled
once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
and that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
stared at the person who killed for no reason
who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'.
and he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
and handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,
william zanzinger with a six month sentence.
oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
bury the rag deep in your face
for now's the time for your tears."
"the man in me will do nearly any task,
and as for compensation, there's little he would ask.
take a woman like you
to get through to the man in me.
storm clouds are raging all around my door,
i think to myself i might not take it any more.
take a woman like your kind
to find the man in me.
but, oh, what a wonderful feeling
just to know that you are near,
sets my a heart a reeling
from my toes up to my ears.
the man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen,
but that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine.
took a woman like you
to get through to the man in me."
"there was a moon out in space
but a cloud drifted over it's face
you kissed me and went on your way
the night we called it a day
i heard the song of the spheres
like a minor lament in my ears
i hadn't the heart left to pray
the night we called it a day
soft through the dark
the hoot of an owl in the sky
sad though his song
no bluer was he than i
the moon went down stars were gone
but the sun didn't rise with the dawn
there wasn't a thing left to say
the night we called it a day
there wasn't a thing left to say
the night we called it a day"

"there was a wicked messenger
from eli he did come,
with a mind that multiplied
the smallest matter.
when questioned who had sent for him,
he answered with his thumb,
for his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.
he stayed behind the assembly hall,
it was there he made his bed,
oftentimes he could be seen returning.
until one day he just appeared
with a note in his hand which read,
""the soles of my feet, i swear they're burning.""
oh, the leaves began to fallin'
and the seas began to part,
and the people that confronted him were many.
and he was told but these few words,
which opened up his heart,
""if ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."""

my god, they killed him.
another man from atlanta, georgia,
name of martin luther king
he shook the land like a rolling thunder
and made the bells of freedom ring today
with a dream of beauty that they could not take away
just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
my god, they killed him.
the only son of god almighty
the holy one called jesus christ
he healed the sick and fed the hungry
and for his love they took his life away
on the road to glory where the story never ends

no one in front of me and nothing behind
there's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne
got white skin, got assassin's eyes
i'm looking up into the sapphire tempered skies
i'm well dressed, waiting on the last train
standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose
any minute now i'm expectin' all hell to break loose
people are crazy and times are strange
i'm locked in tight, i'm out of range
i used to care but   things have changed.
this place ain't doin' me any good
i'm in the wrong town, i should've been in hollywood
just for a second there i thought i saw something move
gonna take dancin' lessons, do the jitterbug rag
ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
only a fool in here would think he got anythin' to prove
lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too
don't get up gentlemen, i'm only passing through
people are crazy and times are strange
i'm locked in tight, i'm out of range
i used to care but   things have changed.
i've been walkin' forty miles of bad road
if the bible is right the world will explode
i'm tryin' to get as far away from myself as i can
some things are too hot to touch
the human mind can only stand so much
you can't win with a losing hand
feel like falling in love with the first woman i meet
puttin' her in a wheelbarrow and wheelin' her down the street
people are crazy and times are strange
i'm locked in tight, i'm out of range
i used to care but   things have changed.
i hurt easy, i just don't show it
you can hurt someone and not even know it
the next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high
all the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
i'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me

you've been sleepin in the rain
from the dirty words and muddy cells
your clothes are soiled and stained
but the dirty words and muddy cells
will soon be hid in shame
so only stop to rest yourself
till you'll go off again
so take off your thirsty boots
and stay for awhile
your feet are hot and weary
from a dusty mile
and maybe i can make you laugh
maybe i can try
i'm just lookin' for the evening
and the morning in your eyes
but tell me of the ones you saw
as far as you could see
across the plain from field to town
a marching to be free
and of the rusted prison gates
that tumbled by degree
like laughing children one by one
who looked like you and me
so take off your thirsty boots
and stay for awhile
your feet are hot and weary
from a dusty mile
and maybe i can make you laugh
maybe i can try
i'm just lookin' for the evening
and the morning in your eyes
i know you are no stranger down
the crooked rainbow trails
from dancing cliff edged shattered sills
of slender shackled jails
but the voices drift up from below
as the walls they're being scaled
all of this and more
your song shall not be failed
so take off your thirsty boots
and stay for awhile
your feet are hot and weary
from a dusty mile
and maybe i can make you laugh
maybe i can try
i'm just lookin' for the evening
and the morning in your eyes"

'fore night turns into day
i wonder why i'm so frightened of dawn
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
there's a moment when all old things
become new again
but that moment might have come and gone
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
i look away, but i keep seeing it
i don't want to believe, but i keep believing it
shadows dance upon the wall
shadows that seem to know it all
am i too blind to see, is my heart playing tricks on me
i'm lost in the crowd
all my tears are gone
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
everything i touch seems to disappear
everywhere i turn you are always here
i'll run this race until my earthly death
i'll defend this place with my dying breath
from a cheerless room in a curtained gloom
i saw a star from heaven fall
i turned and looked again but it was gone
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on"

from california to the new york island
from the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
this land was made for you and me.
as i went walking that ribbon of highway
i saw above me that endless skyway
i saw below me that golden valley
this land was made for you and me.
i roamed and i rambled and i followed my footsteps
to the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
while all around me a voice was sounding
saying this land was made for you and me.
the sun came shining, and i was strolling
and the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
as the fog was lifting, a voice was chanting,
this land was made for you and me.

from the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters

"three angels up above the street,
each one playing a horn,
dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
they've been there since christmas morn.
the wildest cat from montana passes by in a flash,
then a lady in a bright orange dress,
one u haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
the tenth avenue bus going west.
the dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
a man with a badge skips by,
three fellas crawlin' on their way back to work,
nobody stops to ask why.
the bakery truck stops outside of that fence
where the angels stand high on their poles,
the driver peeks out, trying to find one face
in this concrete world full of souls.
the angels play on their horns all day,
the whole earth in progression seems to pass by.
but does anyone hear the music they play,
does anyone even try?"

when she was born in hell's kitchen, i was living down the line
i'm wondering where in the world alicia keys could be
i been looking for her even clear through tennessee
feel like my soul is beginning to expand
look into my heart and you will sort of understand
you brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
the writing on the wall, come read it, come see what it say
thunder on the mountain, rollin' like a drum
gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
i don't need any guide, i already know the way
remember this, i'm your servant both night and day
the pistols are poppin' and the power is down
i'd like to try somethin' but i'm so far from town
the sun keeps shinin' and the north wind keeps picking up speed
gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need
i've been sittin' down studyin' the art of love
i think it will fit me like a glove
i want some real good woman to do just what i say
everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today
thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
some sweet day i'll stand beside my king
i wouldn't betray your love or any other thing
gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of b****es
i'll recruit my army from the orphanages
i been to st. herman's church, said my religious vows
i've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows
i got the porkchops, she got the pie
she ain't no angel and neither am i
shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
i'll say this, i don't give a damn about your dreams
thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
mean old twister bearing down on me
all the ladies in washington scrambling to get out of town
looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down
everybody going and i want to go too
don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
i did all i could, i did it right there and then
i've already confessed   no need to confess again

i don't know,

go ahead and talk.

won't come as any shock.
i must be guilty of something,
you just whisper it into my ear.

she lulled me to sleep,
in a town without pity
where the water runs deep.
she said, ""be easy, baby,
there ain't nothin' worth stealin' in here.""
you're the one i've been looking for,
you're the one that's got the key.
but i can't figure out whether i'm too good for you
or you're too good for me.
has anybody seen my love,
has anybody seen my love,
has anybody seen my love.
i don't know,
has anybody seen my love?
well, they're not showing any lights tonight
and there's no moon.
there's just a hot blooded singer
singing ""memphis in june,""
while they're beatin' the devil out of a guy
who's wearing a powder blue wig.
later he'll be shot
for resisting arrest,
i can still hear his voice crying
in the wilderness.
what looks large from a distance,
close up ain't never that big.
never could learn to drink that blood
and call it wine,
never could learn to hold you, love,
and call you mine."
"time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
we sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
catch the wild fishes that float through the stream,
time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
once i had a sweetheart, she was fine and good lookin',
we sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin',
stared out the window to the stars high above,
time passes slowly when you're searchin' for love.
ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
ain't no reason to go to the fair.
ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
ain't no reason to go anywhere.
time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
we stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right,
like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day,
time passes slowly and fades away."
"it was late last night when the boss came home
to wander early his mansion and a desolate throne
servant said boss the ladies gone
she left this morning just before dawn
you got something to tell me, tell it to me man
come to the point as straight as you can
old henry lee chief of the clan
came riding through the woods and took her by the hand
the boss he lay back flat on his bed
he cursed the heat and he clutched his head
he pondered the future of his fate
to wait another day would be far too late
go fetch me my coat and my tie
and the cheapest labour that money can buy
saddle me up my buckskin mare
if you see me go by put up a prayer
well they rode all night and they rode all day
eastward long on the broad highway
his spirit was tired and his vision was bent
his men deserted him and onward he went
he came to a place where the land was dull
his poor head pounding in his skull
heavy heart was racked with pain
insomnia raging in his brain
well he threw down his helmet and his cross handle sword
he renounced his faith he denied his lord
crawled on his belly put his ear to the wall
one way or another put an end to it all
he leaned down cut the electric wire
stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
peered through the darkness caught a glimpse of the two
hard to tell for certain who was who
he lowered himself down on a golden chain
his nerves were quickening every vein
his knuckles were bloody he sucked in the air
he ran his fingers through his greasy hair
they looked at each other and their glasses clinked
one single unit inseparably linked
got a strange premonition there's a man close by
don't worry about him he wouldn't harm a fly
from behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor
he moved his feet and he bolted the door
shadows hiding the lines in his face
with all the nobility of an ancient race
she turned she was startled by a look of surprise
with the hatred that could hit the skies
you're a reckless fool i could see it in your eyes
to come this way was by no means wise
get up stand up you greedy lipped wench
and cover your face with some other consequence
you are making my heart feel sick
put your clothes on double quick
sill boy you think me a saint
to listen no more to your words of complaint
you've given me nothing but the sweetest lies
now hold your tongue and feed your eyes
id have given you the stars and the planets too
what good are these things to you
by the heart if not the knee
or never again this world you see
oh please let not your heart be cold
this man is dearer to me than gold
oh my dear you must be blind
he's a gutless ape with a worthless mind
you've had your way too long with me
now its me who will determine how things will be
tried to escape he cussed and cursed
you'll have to try get passed me first
i dared not let your passion rule
you think my heart the heart of a fool
and you sir you can not deny
you made a monkey of me for what and for why
ill have no more of this insulting chat
the devil can have you i'll see to that
look sharp or step aside
or in the cradle you'll wish you died
the gun went boom and the shot rang clear
the first bullet grazed his ear
second ball went right straight in
and he bent in the middle like a twisted bin
he crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
he grabbed the chair and he grabbed the bed
it would take more than needle and thread
bleeding from the mouth he's as good as dead
you shot my husband down you fiend
husband what, husband what the hell do you mean
he was man of strife a man of sin
i cut him down and i throw him to the wind
hear this she said with angry breath
you too shall meet the lord of death
it was i who brought your soul to life
and she raised her robe and she drew out a knife
his face was hard and caked with sweat
his arms ached and his hands were wet
you're a murderous woman and bloody wife
if you dont mind ill have the knife
we're two of a kind and our blood runs hot
but we're no way similar in body or thought
all husbands are good men is all i knew
then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow
his knees went limp and he reached for the door
his doom was sealed he slipped to the floor
he whispered in her ear this is all your fault
my fighting days have come to a halt
she touched his lips and kissed his cheek
he tried to speak but his breath was weak
you die for me i will die for you
she put the blade to her heart and she ran it though
all three lovers together in a heap
thrown into the grave forever to sleep
funeral torches blazed away
through the towns and the villages all night and all day"

just you and me
now won't you tell me true

to hold each other tight
the whole night through
ev'rything is always right
when i'm alone with you.
to be alone with you
at the close of the day
with only you in view
while evening slips away
it only goes to show
that while life's pleasures be few
the only one i know
is when i'm alone with you.
they say that nighttime is the right time
to be with the one you love
too many thoughts get in the way in the day
but you're always what i'm thinkin' of
i wish the night were here
bringin' me all of your charms
when only you are near
to hold me in your arms.
i'll always thank the lord
when my working day's through
i get my sweet reward
to be alone with you."

"ramona, come closer,
shut softly your watery eyes.
the pangs of your sadness
shall pass as your senses will rise.
the flowers of the city
though breathlike, get deathlike at times.
and there's no use in tryin'
t' deal with the dyin',
though i cannot explain that in lines.
your cracked country lips,
i still wish to kiss,
as to be under the strength of your skin.
your magnetic movements
still capture the minutes i'm in.
but it grieves my heart, love,
to see you tryin' to be a part of
a world that just don't exist.
it's all just a dream, babe,
a vacuum, a scheme, babe,
that sucks you into feelin' like this.
i can see that your head
has been twisted and fed
by worthless foam from the mouth.
i can tell you are torn
between stayin' and returnin'
on back to the south.
you've been fooled into thinking
that the finishin' end is at hand.
yet there's no one to beat you,
no one t' defeat you,
'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
i've heard you say many times
that you're better 'n no one
and no one is better 'n you.
if you really believe that,
you know you got
nothing to win and nothing to lose.
from fixtures and forces and friends,
your sorrow does stem,
that hype you and type you,
making you feel
that you must be exactly like them.
i'd forever talk to you,
but soon my words,
they would turn into a meaningless ring.
for deep in my heart
i know there is no help i can bring.
everything passes,
everything changes,
just do what you think you should do.
and someday maybe,
who knows, baby,
i'll come and be cryin' to you."

how to enter the gates of paradise

too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, to bring him back
they got some serious people out there man
they can ring your bell and show you how to hold your tongue
they don't come to party man
they kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
they don't believe in mercy
and judgment on them is something you'll never see
they can put your face on a postage stamp
turn your home into a armed camp
anyway they want you
thats the way you'll be

too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, to bring him back

i still see him in my mind climbing up that hill
or was it a wall
i don't recall
it don't matter at all honey
and it never will
ain't nothin' left here partner
just the dust of fools that have left their mark in spades
from now on this will be where you're from

when i was in missouri
they would not let me be

i only saw what they let me see
you broke a heart that loved you
now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
i've been walking that lonesome valley
trying to get to heaven before they close the door
people on the platforms
waiting for the trains
i can hear their hearts a beatin'
like pendulums swinging on chains
when you think that you lost everything
you find out you can always lose a little more
i'm just going down the road feeling bad
trying to get to heaven before they close the door
i'm going down the river
down to new orleans
they tell me everything is gonna be all right
but i don't know what ""all right"" even means
i was riding in a buggy with miss mary jane
miss mary jane got a house in baltimore
i been all around the world, boys
now i'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door
gonna sleep down in the parlor
and relive my dreams
i'll close my eyes and i wonder
if everything is as hollow as it seems
some trains don't pull no gamblers
no midnight ramblers, like they did before
i been to sugar town, i shook the sugar down
now i'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door"

"something about you that i can't shake,
don't know how much of this i can take,
baby i'm under your spell.
i was knocked out and loaded in the naked night.
when my last dream exploded, i noticed your light.
baby, oh what a story i could tell.
it's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
if you ever want to reach me, you know where to look.
baby, i'll be at the same hotel.
i'd like to help you but i'm in a bit of a jam,
i'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where i am.
baby, caught between heaven and hell.
but i will be back, i will survive,
you'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive.
baby, can't you tell.
well it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
i'm starin' at your picture, i'm hearin' your words.
baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
everywhere you go it's enough to break hearts
someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
you were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow.
i trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
don't think i 'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
baby, is there anything left to tell?
i'll see you later when i'm not so out of my head,
maybe next time i'll let the dead bury the dead.
baby, what more can i tell?
well the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
pray that i don't die of thirst,
baby, two feet from the well."
"well, my shoes, they come from singapore,
my flashlight's from taiwan,
my tablecloth's from malaysia,
my belt buckle's from the amazon.
you know, this shirt i wear comes from the philippines
and the car i drive is a chevrolet,
it was put together down in argentina
by a guy makin' thirty cents a day.
well, it's sundown on the union
and what's made in the u.s.a.
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way.
well, this silk dress is from hong kong
and the pearls are from japan.
well, the dog collar's from india
and the flower pot's from pakistan.
all the furniture, it says ""made in brazil""
where a woman, she slaved for sure
bringin' home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve,
you know, that's a lot of money to her.
well, it's sundown on the union
and what's made in the u.s.a.
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way.
well, you know, lots of people complainin' that there is no work.
i say, ""why you say that for
when nothin' you got is u.s. made?""
they don't make nothin' here no more,
you know, capitalism is above the law.
it say, ""it don't count 'less it sells.""
when it costs too much to build it at home
you just build it cheaper someplace else.
well, it's sundown on the union
and what's made in the u.s.a.
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way.
well, the job that you used to have,
they gave it to somebody down in el salvador.
the unions are big business, friend,
and they're goin' out like a dinosaur.
they used to grow food in kansas
now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
i can see the day coming when even your home garden
is gonna be against the law.
well, it's sundown on the union
and what's made in the u.s.a.
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way.
democracy don't rule the world,
you'd better get that in your head.
this world is ruled by violence
but i guess that's better left unsaid.
from broadway to the milky way,
that's a lot of territory indeed
and a man's gonna do what he has to do
when he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
well, it's sundown on the union
and what's made in the u.s.a.
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way"
"everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
death kept followin', trackin' us down, at least i heard your bluebird sing.
now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy,
i know you're long gone,
i guess it must be up to me.
if i'd thought about it i never would've done it, i guess i would've let it slide,
if i'd lived my life by what others were thinkin', the heart inside me would've died.
i was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity,
someone had to reach for the risin' star,
i guess it was up to me.
oh, the union central is pullin' out and the orchids are in bloom,
i've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
in fourteen months i've only smiled once and i didn't do it consciously,
somebody's got to find your trail,
i guess it must be up to me.
it was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
i'd just about convinced myself that nothin' had changed that much.
the old rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key,
somebody had to unlock your heart,
he said it was up to me.
well, i watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
i would've followed you in the door but i didn't have a ticket stub.
so i waited all night 'til the break of day, hopin' one of us could get free,
when the dawn came over the river bridge,
i knew it was up to me.
oh, the only decent thing i did when i worked as a postal clerk
was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where i used to work.
was i a fool or not to try to protect your identity?
you looked a little burned out, my friend,
i thought it might be up to me.
well, i met somebody face to face and i had to remove my hat,
she's everything i need and love but i can't be swayed by that.
it frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
but she ain't a gonna make me move,
i guess it must be up to me.
we heard the sermon on the mount and i knew it was too complex,
it didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
when you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty,
somebody's got to tell the tale,
i guess it must be up to me.
well, dupree came in pimpin' tonight to the thunderbird cafe,
crystal wanted to talk to him, i had to look the other way.
well, i just can't rest without you, love, i need your company,
but you ain't a gonna cross the line,
i guess it must be up to me.
there's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to estelle,
she's the one you been wond'rin' about, but there's really nothin' much to tell.
we both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history,
somebody's got to cry some tears,
i guess it must be up to me.
so go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime,
the ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time.
and the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property,
one of us has got to hit the road,
i guess it must be up to me.
and if we never meet again, baby, remember me,
how my lone guitar played sweet for you that old time melody.
and the harmonica around my neck, i blew it for you, free,
no one else could play that tune,
you know it was up to me."
"ain't it just like the night to play tricks
when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
we sit here stranded,
though we're all doin' our best to deny it
and louise holds a handful of rain,
temptin' you to defy it
lights flicker from the opposite loft
in this room the heat pipes just cough
the country music station plays soft
but there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
just louise and her lover so entwined
and these visions of johanna that conquer my mind
in the empty lot
where the ladies play blindman's bluff
with the key chain
and the all night girls
they whisper of escapades out on the train
we can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
louise, she's all right, she's just near
she's delicate and seems like the mirror
but she just makes it all too concise and too clear
that johanna's not here
the ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
where these visions of johanna
have now taken my place
now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
he brags of his misery,
he likes to live dangerously
and when bringing her name up
he speaks of a farewell kiss to me
he's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
muttering small talk at the wall
while i'm in the hall
how can i explain?
oh, it's so hard to get on
and these visions of johanna,
they kept me up past the dawn
inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
voices echo this is what salvation
must be like after a while
but mona lisa musta had the highway blues
you can tell by the way she smiles
see the primitive wallflower freeze
when the jelly faced women all sneeze
hear the one with the mustache say,
""jeeze i can't find my knees""
oh, jewels and binoculars
hang from the head of the mule
but these visions of johanna,
they make it all seem so cruel
the peddler now speaks to the countess
who's pretending to care for him
sayin', ""name me someone that's not a parasite
and i'll go out and say a prayer for him""
but like louise always says
""ya can't look at much, can ya man?""
as she, herself, prepares for him
and madonna, she still has not showed
we see this empty cage now corrode
where her cape of the stage once had flowed
the fiddler, he now steps to the road
he writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
on the back of the fish truck that loads
while my conscience explodes
the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
and these visions of johanna
are now all that remain"

i can tell you're only lying.
if you got something better tonight,
don't mess up my mind with your crying.
walk out in the rain,
walk out with your dreams,

if it doesn't feel right
and catch the next train.
oh, darling, walk out in the rain.
i have come from so far away
just to put a ring on your finger.
you've said all that you've got to say,
so please don't feel the need to linger.

oh, darling, walk out in the rain.
it's rainin' inside of the city,

if you don't want my love, it's a pity,
i guess i can't see you no more.

"wallflower, wallflower
won't you dance with me?
i'm sad and lonely too.
wallflower, wallflower
won't you dance with me?
i'm fallin' in love with you.
just like you i'm wondrin' what i'm doin' here.
just like you i'm wondrin' what's goin' on.
wallflower, wallflower
won't you dance with me?
the night will soon be gone.
i have seen you standing in the smoky haze
and i know that you're gonna be mine one of these days,
mine alone.
wallflower, wallflower
take a chance on me.
please let me ride you home."
"oh, the age of the inmates
i remember quite freely:
no younger than twelve,
no older 'n seventeen.
thrown in like bandits
and cast off like criminals,
inside the walls,
the walls of red wing.
from the dirty old mess hall
you march to the brick wall,
too weary to talk
and too tired to sing.
oh, it's all afternoon
you remember your home town,
inside the walls,
the walls of red wing.
oh, the gates are cast iron
and the walls are barbed wire.
stay far from the fence
with the 'lectricity sting.
and it's keep down your head
and stay in your number,
inside the walls,
the walls of red wing.
oh, it's fare thee well
to the deep hollow dungeon,
farewell to the boardwalk
that takes you to the screen.
and farewell to the minutes
they threaten you with it,
inside the walls,
the walls of red wing.
it's many a guard
that stands around smilin',
holdin' his club
like he was a king.
hopin' to get you
behind a wood pilin',
inside the walls,
the walls of red wing.
the night aimed shadows
through the crossbar windows,
and the wind punched hard
to make the wall siding sing.
it's many a night i pretended to be a sleepin',
inside the walls,
the walls of red wing.
as the rain rattled heavy
on the bunk house shingles,
and the sounds in the night,
they made my ears ring.
'til the keys of the guards
clicked the tune of the morning,
inside the walls,
the walls of red wing.
oh, some of us'll end up
in st. cloud prison,
and some of us'll wind up
to be lawyers and things,
and some of us'll stand up
to meet you on your crossroads,
from inside the walls,
the walls of red wing."
"someday you'll find
that the world's left you out
no true love, no nothing
just roaming about
parties and people
and a cold heart within
and each time you're dancing
you're waltzing with sin
you're satan made over
in perfect disguise
unfaithful, unworthy
and oh so unwise
i pity the heart
of the next guy you win
like me you'll be losing
while waltzing with sin
let's try it again
some day you'll find
that the world's left you out
no true love, no nothing
just roaming about
well, parties and people
and a cold heart within
and each time you're dancing
you're waltzing with sin
you're satan made over
in perfect disguise
unfaithful, unworthy
and oh so unwise
i pity the heart
of the next guy you win
like me you'll be losing

"wanted man in california, wanted man in buffalo,
wanted man in kansas city, wanted man in ohio,
wanted man in mississippi, wanted man in old cheyenne,
wherever you might look tonight, you might see this wanted man.
i might be in colorado or georgia by the sea,
working for some man who may not know at all who i might be.
if you ever see me comin' and if you know who i am,
don't you breathe it to nobody 'cause you know i'm on the lam.
wanted man by lucy watson, wanted man by jeannie brown,
wanted man by nellie johnson, wanted man in this next town.
but i've had all that i've wanted of a lot of things i had
and a lot more than i needed of some things that turned out bad.
i got sidetracked in el paso, stopped to get myself a map
went the wrong way into juarez with juanita on my lap.
then i went to sleep in shreveport, woke up in abilene
wonderin' why the hell i'm wanted at some town halfway between.
wanted man in albuquerque, wanted man in syracuse,
wanted man in tallahassee, wanted man in baton rouge,
there's somebody set to grab me anywhere that i might be
and wherever you might look tonight, you might get a glimpse of me.
wanted man in california, wanted man in buffalo,
wanted man in kansas city, wanted man in ohio,
wanted man in mississippi, wanted man in old cheyenne,
wherever you might look tonight, you might see this wanted man."
"what's the matter with me,
i don't have much to say,
daylight sneakin' through the window
and i'm still in this all night cafe.
walkin' to and fro beneath the moon
out to where the trucks are rollin' slow,
to sit down on this bank of sand
and watch the river flow.
wish i was back in the city
instead of this old bank of sand,
with the sun beating down over the chimney tops
and the one i love so close at hand.
if i had wings and i could fly,
i know where i would go.
but right now i'll just sit here so contentedly
and watch the river flow.
people disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah,
makes you stop and all wonder why.
why only yesterday i saw somebody on the street
who just couldn't help but cry.
oh, this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,
no matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,
and as long as it does i'll just sit here
and watch the river flow.
people disagreeing everywhere you look,
makes you wanna stop and read a book.
why only yesterday i saw somebody on the street
that was really shook.
but this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,
no matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,
and as long as it does i'll just sit here
and watch the river flow.
watch the river flow,
watchin' the river flow,
watchin' the river flow,
but i'll sit down on this bank of sand
and watch the river flow."
"love that's pure hopes all things,
believes all things, won't pull no strings,
won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome,
capture your heart and hold it for ransom.
you don't want a love that's pure
you wanna drown love
you want a watered down love
love that's pure, it don't make no claims,
intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
will not deceive you or lead you to transgression,
won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
you don't want a love that's pure
you wanna drown love
you want a watered down love
love that's pure won't lead you astray,
won't hold you back, won't mess up your day,
won't pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes,
it don't make you envious, it don't make you suspicious.
you don't want a love that's pure
you wanna drown love
you want a watered down love
love that's pure ain't no accident,
always on time, is always content,
an eternal flame, quietly burning,
never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning.
you don't want a love that's pure
you wanna drown love
you want a watered down love"
"i think we better talk this over
maybe when we both get sober
you'll understand i'm only a man
doin' the best that i can.
this situation can only get rougher.
why should we needlessly suffer?
let's call it a day, go our own different ways
before we decay.
you don't have to be afraid of looking into my face,
we've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
i feel displaced, i got a low down feeling
you been two faced, you been double dealing.
i took a chance, got caught in the trance
of a downhill dance.
oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
i'm exiled, you can't convert me.
i'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways
with both eyes glazed.
you don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
i guess i'll be leaving tomorrow
if i have to beg, steal or borrow.
it'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half
look at each other and laugh.
but i don't think it's liable to happen
like the sound of one hand clappin'.
the vows that we kept are now broken and swept
'neath the bed where we slept.
don't think of me and fantasize on what we never had,
be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
oh, babe, time for a new transition
i wish i was a magician.
i would wave a wand and tie back the bond
that we've both gone beyond."
"i love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
i love you more than money and more than the stars above,
love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea,
love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
i've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
to the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun,
i love you more than ever and i haven't yet begun.
you breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
when i was deep in poverty you taught me how to give,
dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole,
quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul.
you gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life,
eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
my thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if i lie,
i'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.
the tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
we'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth,
what's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
but happiness to me is you and i love you more than blood.
it's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge,
'cause i love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend,
and if there is eternity i'd love you there again.
oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
and i was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride,
you're the other half of what i am, you're the missing piece
and i love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
you turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
just bein' next to you is a natural thing for me
and i could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
'cause i love you more than ever now that the past is gone."
"went to see the gypsy
stayin' in a big hotel
he smiled when he saw me coming
and he said, ""well, well, well""
his room was dark and crowded
lights were low and dim
""how are you?"" he said to me
i said it back to him
i went down to the lobby
to make a small call out
a pretty dancing girl was there
and she began to shout
""go on back to see the gypsy
he can move you from the rear
drive you from your fear
bring you through the mirror
he did it in las vegas
and he can do it here""
outside the lights were shining
on the river of tears
i watched them from the distance
with music in my ears
i went back to see the gypsy
it was nearly early dawn
the gypsy's door was open wide
but the gypsy was gone
and that pretty dancing girl
she could not be found
so i watched that sun come rising
from that little minnesota town"
"you have given everything to me.
what can i do for you?
you have given me eyes to see.
what can i do for you?
pulled me out of bondage and
you made me renewed inside,
filled up a hunger that had always been denied,
opened up a door no man can shut and
you opened it up so wide
and you've chosen me to be among the few.
what can i do for you?
you have laid down your life for me.
what can i do for you?
you have explained every mystery.
what can i do for you?
soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly,
he gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
who would deliver him from the death he's bound to
die?
well, you've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do.
what can i do for you?
you have given all there is to give.
what can i do for you?
you have given me life to live.
how can i live for you?
i know all about poison, i know all about fiery darts,
i don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
whatever pleases you, tell it to my heart.
well, i don't deserve it but i sure did make it
through.
what can i do for you?"
"what good am i if i'm like all the rest,
if i just turned away, when i see how you're dressed,
if i shut myself off so i can't hear you cry,
what good am i?
what good am i if i know and don't do,
if i see and don't say, if i look right through you,
if i turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky,
what good am i?
what good am i while you softly weep
and i hear in my head what you say in your sleep,
and i freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
what good am i?
what good am i then to others and me
if i've had every chance and yet still fail to see
bridge: if my hands tied must i not wonder within
who tied them and why and where must i have been
what good am i if i say foolish things
and i laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
and i just turn my back while you silently die,
what good am i?"
"what was it you wanted?
tell me again so i'll know.
what's happening in there,
what's going on in your show.
what was it you wanted,
could you say it again?
i'll be back in a minute
you can get it together by then.
what was it you wanted
you can tell me, i'm back,
we can start it all over
get it back on the track,
you got my attention,
go ahead, speak.
what was it you wanted
when you were kissing my cheek?
was there somebody looking
when you give me that kiss
someone there in the shadows
someone that i might have missed?
is there something you needed,
something i don't understand.
what was it you wanted,
do i have it here in my hand?
whatever you wanted
slipped out of my mind,
would you remind me again
if you'd be so kind.
has the record been breaking,
did the needle just skip,
is there somebody waitin',
was there a slip of the lip?
what was it you wanted
i ain't keepin' score
are you the same person
that was here before?
is it something important?
maybe not.
what was it you wanted?
tell me again i forgot.
whatever you wanted
what could it be
did somebody tell you
that you could get it from me,
is it something that comes natural
is it easy to say,
why do you want it,
who are you anyway?
is the scenery changing,
am i getting it wrong,
is the whole thing going backwards,
are they playing our song?
where were you when it started

"when did you leave heaven ?
how could they let you go ?
how's every thing in heaven ?
i'd like to know.
why did you trade heaven ?
for all these earthly things ?
where on earth did you hide your halo ?
where did you lose your wings ?
have they missed you ?
can you get back in ?
if i kiss you would it be a sin ?
i am only human
but you are so divine.
when did you leave heaven
angel mine ?"
"the iron hand it ain't no match for the iron rod,
the strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
for all those who have eyes and all those who have ears
it is only he who can reduce me to tears.
don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn
for like a thief in the night, he'll replace wrong with right
when he returns.
truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
he unleashed his power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
how long can i listen to the lies of prejudice?
how long can i stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
can i cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
will i ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease
until he returns?
surrender your crown on this blood stained ground, take off your mask,
he sees your deeds, he knows your needs even before you ask.
how long can you falsify and deny what is real?
how long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
of every earthly plan that be known to man, he is unconcerned,
he's got plans of his own to set up his throne
when he returns."
"oh, the streets of rome are filled with rubble,
ancient footprints are everywhere.
you can almost think that you're seein' double
on a cold, dark night on the spanish stairs.
got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
where i've got me a date with botticelli's niece.
she promised that she'd be right there with me
when i paint my masterpiece.
oh, the hours i've spent inside the coliseum,
dodging lions and wastin' time.
oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, i could hardly stand to see 'em,
yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory,
when i ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese.
someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
when i paint my masterpiece.
sailin' 'round the world in a dirty gondola.
oh, to be back in the land of coca cola!
i left rome and landed in brussels,
on a plane ride so bumpy that i almost cried.
clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles,
everyone was there to greet me when i stepped inside.
newspapermen eating candy
had to be held down by big police.
someday, everything is gonna be diff'rent
when i paint my masterpiece."
"in the still of the night, in the world's ancient light
where wisdom grows up in strife
my bewildered brain, toils in vain
through the darkness on the pathways of life
each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
tomorrow keeps turning around
we live and we die, we know not why
but i'll be with you when the deal goes down
we eat and we drink, we feel and we think
far down the street we stray
i laugh and i cry and i'm haunted by
things i never meant nor wished to say
the midnight rain follows the train
we all wear the same thorny crown
soul to soul, our shadows roll
and i'll be with you when the deal goes down
well, the moon gives light and it shines by night
when i scarcely feel the glow
we learn to live and then we forgive
o'r the road we're bound to go
more frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
that keep us so tightly bound
you come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
and i'll be with you when the deal goes down
well, i picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
i followed the winding stream
i heard the deafening noise, i felt transient joys
i know they're not what they seem
in this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
you'll never see me frown
i owe my heart to you, and that's sayin' it true
and i'll be with you when the deal goes down"
"look out across the fields, see me returning,
smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile.
from the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
you've had time to think about it for a while.
well, i've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
it's the end of the chase and the moon is high.
it won't matter who loves who,
you'll love me or i'll love you
when the night comes falling from the sky.
i can see through your walls and i know you're hurting,
sorrow covers you up like a cape.
only yesterday i know that you've been flirting
with disaster that you managed to escape.
i can't provide for you no easy answers,
who are you that i should have to lie?
you'll know all about it, love,
it'll fit you like a glove
when the night comes falling from the sky.
i can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
you must have been protecting someone last time i called.
i've never asked you for nothing you couldn't deliver,
i've never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
i saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
for the love of a lousy buck, i've watched them die.
stick around, baby, we're not through,
don't look for me, i'll see you
when the night comes falling from the sky.
in your teardrops, i can see my own reflection,
it was on the northern border of texas where i crossed the line.
i don't want to be a fool starving for affection,
i don't want to drown in someone else's wine.
for all eternity i think i will remember
that icy wind that's howling in your eye.
you will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
when the night comes falling from the sky.
well, i sent you my feelings in a letter
but you were gambling for support.
this time tomorrow i'll know you better
when my memory is not so short.
this time i'm asking for freedom,
freedom from a world which you deny.
and you'll give it to me now,
i'll take it anyhow
when the night comes falling from the sky."
"oh the time will come up
when the winds will stop
and the breeze will cease to be breathin'.
like the stillness in the wind
'fore the hurricane begins,
the hour when the ship comes in.
oh the seas will split
and the ship will hit
and the sands on the shoreline will be shaking.
then the tide will sound
and the wind will pound
and the morning will be breaking.
oh the fishes will laugh
as they swim out of the path
and the seagulls they'll be smiling.
and the rocks on the sand
will proudly stand,
the hour that the ship comes in.
and the words that are used
for to get the ship confused
will not be understood as they're spoken.
for the chains of the sea
will have busted in the night
and will be buried at the bottom of the ocean.
a song will lift
as the mainsail shifts
and the boat drifts on to the shoreline.
and the sun will respect
every face on the deck,
the hour that the ship comes in.
then the sands will roll
out a carpet of gold
for your weary toes to be a touchin'.
and the ship's wise men
will remind you once again
that the whole wide world is watchin'.
oh the foes will rise
with the sleep still in their eyes
and they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'.
but they'll pinch themselves and squeal
and know that it's for real,
the hour when the ship comes in.
then they'll raise their hands,
sayin' we'll meet all your demands,
but we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered.
and like pharaoh's tribe,
they'll be drownded in the tide,
and like goliath, they'll be conquered."
"ollie told me i'm a fool. so i
walked on down the road a mile, went to the house that brings a smile
sat upon my grandpa's knee, and what do you think he said to me?
when you awake you will remember ev'rything, you will be
hangin' on a string from your... when you believe, you will relieve the only
soul
that you were born with to grow old and never know
ollie showed me the fork in the road.
you can take to the left or go straight to the right,
use your days and save your nights,
be careful where you step, and watch wha cha eat,
sleep with the light on and you got it beat.
ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
the street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
but what am i supposed to do:
read the writing on the wall,
i heard itwhen i was very small.
wash my hand in lye water, i got a date with the
captains daughter. you can go and tell your brother. we sure gonna
love one another, oh! you
may be right and ya might be wrong, i ain't gonna worry all day long.
snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, my old car froze
up last night. ain't no reason to hang your head i could wake up in the
mornin' dead. oh! and
if i thought it would do any good, i'd stand on the rock where moses stood."
"there's a long distance train rolling through the rain, tears on the letter i write.
there's a woman i long to touch and i miss her so much but she's drifting like a
satellite. there's a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze, laughter down on
elizabeth street
and a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone where she bathed in a stream of pure
heat. her father would emphasize you got to be more than street wise but he practiced
what he preached from the heart.
a full blooded cherokee, he predicted to me the time and the place that
the trouble would start.
there's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
and a longtime golden haired stripper onstage
and she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
of a book that no one can write.
oh, where are you tonight?
the truth was obscure, too profound and too pure, to live it you have to explode.
in that last hour of need, we entirely agreed, sacrifice was the code of the road.
i left town at dawn, with marcel and st. john, strong men belittled by doubt.
i couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were but she had some way of finding
them out. he took dead center aim but he missed just the same, she was waiting,
putting
flowers on the shelf.
she could feel my despair as i climbed up her hair and discovered her invisible self.
there's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
there's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped,
as her beauty fades and i watch her undrape,
i won't, but then again, maybe i might.
oh, if i could just find you tonight.
i fought with my twin, that enemy within, 'til both of us fell by the way.
horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees while the law looks the other way.
your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes, the guy you were lovin'
couldn't stay clean.
it felt outa place, my foot in his face, but he should a stayed where his money was
green.
i bit into the root of forbidden fruit with the juice running down my leg.
then i dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss and who always was
too proud to beg.
there's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room and a pathway that leads
up to the stars.
if you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise, remind me to show you the
scars.
there's a new day at dawn and i've finally arrived.
if i'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know i've survived.
i can't believe it, i can't believe i'm alive,
but without you it just doesn't seem right.
oh, where are you tonight?"
"where are you, where have you gone without me
i thought you cared about me, where are you
where's my heart, where is the dream we started
i can't believe we're parted, where are you
when we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
when i gave you my love, was it all in vain
all life through, must i go on pretending
where is my happy ending, where are you
when we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
when i gave you my love, was it all in vain
all life through, must i go on pretending
where is that happy ending, where are you, where are you"
"far away where the soft wind blow,
far away from it all,
there is a place you go
where teardrops fall.
far away in the stormy night,
far away and over the wall,
you are there in the flickering light
where teardrops fall.
we banged the drum slowly
and played the fife lowly
you know the song in my heart
bridge: in the turning of twilight
in the shadows of moonlight
you can show me a new place to start
i've torn my clothes and i've drained the cup
strippin' away at it all,
thinking of you when the sun comes up
where teardrops fall.
by rivers of blindness,
in love and with kindness
we could hold up s toast if we meet
bridge: to the cuttin' of fences
to sharpen the senses
that linger in the fireball heat.
roses are red, violets are blue
and time is beginning to crawl,
i just might have to come see you
where teardrops fall."
"who killed davey moore,
why an' what's the reason for?
""not i,"" says the referee,
""don't point your finger at me.
i could've stopped it in the eighth
an' maybe kept him from his fate,
but the crowd would've booed, i'm sure,
at not gettin' their money's worth.

it wasn't me that made him fall.
no, you can't blame me at all.""

laid him low in a cloud of mist,
who came here from cuba's door
where boxing ain't allowed no more.
""i hit him, yes, it's true,
but that's what i am paid to do.
don't say 'murder,' don't say 'kill.'
it was destiny, it was god's will.""

"i'm sentimental, so i walk in the rain
i've got some habits even i can't explain
could start for the corner, turn up in spain
but why try to change me now?
i sit and daydream, i've got daydreams galore
cigarette ashes, there they go on the floor
i'll go away weekends, leave my keys in the door
but why try to change me now?
why can't i be more conventional?
people talk, people stare, so i try
but that's not for me, 'cause i can't see
my kind of crazy world go passing me by
so, let people wonder, let 'em laugh, let 'em frown
you know i'll love you till the moon's upside down
don't you remember i was always your clown?
why try to change me now?"

wiggle 'til the moon sees you.

wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, like a swarm of bees,
wiggle on your hands and knees.

"winterlude, winterlude, oh darlin',
winterlude by the road tonight.
tonight there will be no quarrelin',
ev'rything is gonna be all right.
oh, i see by the angel beside me
that love has a reason to shine.
you're the one i adore, come over here and give me more,
then winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
winterlude, winterlude, my little apple,
winterlude by the corn in the field,
winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
then come back and cook up a meal.
well, come out when the skating rink glistens
by the sun, near the old crossroads sign.
the snow is so cold, but our love can be bold,
winterlude, don't be rude, please be mine.
winterlude, winterlude, my little daisy,
winterlude by the telephone wire,
winterlude, it's makin' me lazy,
come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
the moonlight reflects from the window
where the snowflakes, they cover the sand.
come out tonight, ev'rything will be tight,
winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand."
"oh my name it ain't nothin'
my age it means less
the country i come from
is called the midwest
i's taught and brought up there
the laws to abide
and that the land that i live in
has god on its side.
oh the history books tell it
they tell it so well
the cavalries charged
the indians fell
the cavalries charged
the indians died
oh the country was young
with god on its side.
the spanish american
war had its day
and the civil war too was
soon laid away
and the names of the heroes
i's made to memorize
with guns in their hands
and god on their side.
the first world war, boys
it came and it went
the reason for fighting
i never did get
but i learned to accept it
accept it with pride
for you don't count the dead
when god's on your side.
the second world war
came to an end
we forgave the germans
and then we were friends
though they murdered six million
in the ovens they fried
the germans now too
have god on their side.
i've learned to hate the russians
all through my whole life
if another war comes
it's them we must fight
to hate them and fear them
to run and to hide
and accept it all bravely
with god on my side.
but now we've got weapons
of chemical dust
if fire them we're forced to
then fire them we must
one push of the button
and a shot the world wide
and you never ask questions
when god's on your side.
through many dark hour
i've been thinkin' about this
that jesus christ
was betrayed by a kiss
but i can't think for you
you'll have to decide
whether judas iscariot
had god on his side.
so now as i'm leavin'
i'm weary as hell
the confusion i'm feelin'
ain't no tongue can tell
the words fill my head
and fall to the floor
that if god's on our side
he'll stop the next war."

starlight by the edge of the creek

they say low wages are a reality
if we want to compete abroad
my cruel weapons have been put on the shelf

meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the frontline
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

tossed by the winds and the seas
i'll drag 'em all down to hell and i'll stand 'em at the wall
i'll sell 'em to their enemies

sometimes you can't give it away

some of them may be deaf and dumb
no man, no woman knows
the hour that sorrow will come

i can feel a lover's breath

sleep is like a temporary death
well, they burned my barn, and they stole my horse
i can't save a dime
i got to be careful, i don't want to be forced
into a life of continual crime
i can see for myself that the sun is sinking
how i wish you were here to see
tell me now, am i wrong in thinking
that you have forgotten me?
now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
they waste your nights and days
them i will forget
but you i'll remember always
old memories of you to me have clung
you've wounded me with your words
gonna have to straighten out your tongue
it's all true, everything you've heard
in you, my friend, i find no blame
wanna look in my eyes, please do
no one can ever claim
that i took up arms against you
all across the peaceful sacred fields
they will lay you low
they'll break your horns and slash you with steel
i say it so it must be so
now i'm down on my luck and i'm black and blue
gonna give you another chance
i'm all alone, i'm expecting you
to lead me off in a cheerful dance

i'm going where i'm never been before.
so i got those worries blues, lord,
i got the worried blues,
i got the worried blues ,

"stranded out in the night,
eliza took me down
to see the widow give
rain to the town.
it's against the law
to be a tonic man,
but the widow knows
she's got the upper hand.
so i went on in
feelin' kinda wheezy.
you know she soothed my mind, boys,
she rocked me kinda slow and easy
all day and all night.
pick a card before you go
it's a long trip to mexico.
eliza wait by the door,
i can't stay here anymore, no, no.
then she took a pill
she washed her feet in the mud
she said ""look out son,
you know, i just ordered a flood
for forty days and forty nights"".
then i dropped my shoes,
eliza called my name.
she said it looked to her
like it's gonna rain.
then the cotton king
came in chokin'
and the widow laughed and said:
""i ain't jokin'.
take once for all""
she said ""now don't ya tease me.
i just fell in love, boy,
so rock me kinda slow and kinda easy,
all day and all night.""
sweet william said
with a drunken head:
""if i had a boat,
i'd help y'all float"".
eliza stood there watching,
william in a trance,
as the widow did the st. vitus dance.
but just then an old man
with a boat named ""breezy""
said: ""you can ride with clyde, boys,
if you rock it kinda slow and easy,
all day and all night""."
"you harbor resentment
you know there ain't too much of a thrill
you wish for contentment
but you got an emptiness that can't be filled
you've had enough hatred
your bones are breaking  can't find nothing sacred, 
ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
in a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
the dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
and ye shall be changed
everything you've gotten
you've gotten by sweat, blood and muscle
from early in the morning 'til way past dark
all you ever do is hustle
all your loved ones have walked out the door
you're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more, but
ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
in a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
the dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
and ye shall be changed
 the past don't control you
but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning
 deep down inside
you know you need a whole new beginning
don't have to go to russia or iran
just surrender to god and he'll move you right here where you stand, and
ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
in a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
the dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
and ye shall be changed
you drink bitter water
and you been eating the bread of sorrow
you can't live for today
when all you're ever thinking of is tomorrow
the path you've endured has been rough
and when you've decided that you've had enough, then
ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
in a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
the dead will arise and burst out of your cloths
and ye shall be changed"

"you angel you
you got me under your wing.
the way you walk and the way you talk
i feel i could almost sing.
you angel you
you're as fine as anything's fine.
the way you walk and the way you talk
it sure plays on my mind.
you know i can't sleep at night for trying,
never did feel this way before.
i get up at night and walk the floor.
if this is love then gimme more
and more and more and more and more.
you angel you
you're as fine as can be.
the way you smile like a sweet baby child,
it just falls all over me.
you know i can't sleep at night for trying
never did feel this way before,
never did get up and walk the floor.
if this is love then gimme more
and more and more and more.
you angel you
you got me under your wing.
the way you walk and the way you talk
it says everything."
"our conversation was short and sweet
it nearly swept me off my feet
and i'm back in the rain
oh, and you are on dry land
you made it there somehow
you're a big girl now
bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
he's singing his song for me at his own expense
and i'm just like that bird
oh, singing just for you
i hope that you can hear
hear me singing through these tears
time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
oh but what a shame, that all we've shared can't last
i can change i swear
oh, see what you can do
i can make it through
you can make it too
love is so simple, to quote a phrase
you've known it all the time, i'm learning it these days
and i know where i can find you
oh, in somebody's room
it's a price i have to pay
you're a big girl all the way
a change in the weather is known to be extreme
but it ain't like changing horses in midstream
i'm going out of my mind
oh, with a pain that stops and starts
like a corkscrew to the heart
ever since we've been apart
rpm"
"see the pyramids
along the nile
watch the sun rise
on a tropic isle
just remember darling
all the while
you belong to me...
see the market place
in old algiers
send me photographs
and souvenirs
just remember
'til your dream appears
you belong to me....
i'll be so alone
without you
maybe
you'll be lonesome, too
maybe
you'll be lonesome too
and blue
fly the ocean
in a silver plane
see the jungle
when its wet with rains
just remember
till you're home again
or until i come home to you
you belong to me.."
"you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need
you made my heart bleed
you changed my life
you changed my life
now the nature of man
is to beg and to steal
i'd do it myself
it's not so unreal
the call of the wild's
forever at my door
want me to fly like an eagle
being chained to the floor, but
you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need
you made my heart bleed
you changed my life
you changed my life
eating with the pigs
off a fancy tray
i was bold, i was looking good
and to have a nice day
it all seemed so proper
and so elite
eating absolute garbage
while being so discreet.
you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need
you made my heart bleed
you changed my life
you changed my life
you were glowing in the light
being peaceably calm
well, how often does a man dance
to the beat of the balm?
your eyes were on fire
your feet were of brass
in a world that you made
you were an outcast
you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need
you made my heart bleed
you changed my life
you changed my life
truce makers and partakers
of every selfish whim
her running to meet me running to her
and you running back to him
their destruction of my confidence
was like a sharpness of the tongue
i said: make my faith greater
but i was a little high strung
you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need
you made my heart bleed
you changed my life
you changed my life"
"well i told my baby
i said baby, i know where you been
well, i know who you are
and what league you played in
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn.
well, the night is so empty
so quit and still
for only fifteen hundred dollars
you can have anybody killed
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn.
well, i told my baby
further down the line
i said, ?what happens tomorrow
is on your head, not mine?
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn."

"i've seen love go by my door
it's never been this close before
never been so easy or so slow
been shootin' in the dark too long
if something's not right it's wrong
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
dragon clouds so high above
i've only known careless love
it always has hit me from below
but this time it's more correct
right on target so direct
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
purple clover queen anne lace
crimson hair across your face
you can make me cry if you don't know
can't remember what i was thinking of
you might be spoiling me too much love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
blue river running slow and lazy
i could spend forever with you and never realise the time
situations have ended sad
relationships have all been bad
mine have been like verlaine's and rimbaud
but there's no way i can compare
all them scenes to this affair
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
you're gonna make me wonder what i'm doing
staying far behind without you
you're gonna make me wonder what i'm saying
you're gonna make me give myself a good talking to
i'll look for you in old honolula
san francisco, ashtabula
you're gonna have to leave me now i know
but i'll see you in the sky above
in the tall grass in the ones i love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go"
"you're gonna quit me, baby,
good as i been to you, lawd, lawd.
good as i been to you, lawd, lawd.
good as i been to you.
give you my money, honey,
buy you shoes and clothes, lawd, lawd.
you're gonna quit me, baby,
put me outta doors, lawd, lawd.
six months on the chain gang,
believe me, it ain't no fun, lawd, lawd.
day you quit me, baby,
that's the day you die, lawd, lawd.
jailhouse ain't no plaything,
believe me, ain't no lie, lawd, lawd.
day you quit me, baby,
that's the day you die, lawd, lawd."
"well i don't know why i love you like i do
nobody in the world can get along with you.
you got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
i come home last night you wouldn't even let me in.
well sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
when you get a crazy notion of jumpin' all over me
well you give me the blues i guess you're satisfied
an' you give me the blues i wanna lay down and die.
i helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
i helped you when you had no food to eat.
you're the kind of woman i just don't understand
you're takin' all my money and give it to another man.
well you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brain
you're the kinda woman drives a man insane
you give me the blues, i guess you're satisfied
you give me the blues, i wanna lay down and die
well you give me the blues, i wanna lay down and die"
"fairy tales can come true
it can happen to you
if you're young at heart
for it's hard you will find
to be narrow of mind
if you're young at heart
you can go to extremes
with impossible schemes
you can laugh when your dreams
fall apart at the seams
and life gets more exciting
with each passing day
and love is either in your heart
or on it's way
don't you know that it's worth
every treasure on earth
to be young at heart
for as rich as you are
it's much better by far
to be young at heart
and if you should survive to 105
look at all you'll derive
out of being alive
and here is the best part
you've had a head start
if you are among the very
young at heart
and if you should survive
to a hundred and five
look at all you'll derive
out of being alive
and here is the best part
you've had a head start
if you are among the very
young at heart
and if you should survive
to a hundred and five
look at all you'll derive
out of being alive
and here is the best part
you've had a head start
if you are among the very
young at heart"
