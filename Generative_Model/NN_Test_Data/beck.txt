"go it alone
i'm comin over
see me down at the station
by the lane
with my hands in my pocket
jingling a wish coin
that i stole from a fountain
that was drowning all the cares in the world
when i get older
climbin up on the back porch fence
just to see the dogs runnin
with a ring and a question
and my shiverin voice is singing
thru a crack in the window
i better go it alone
down on the corner
see me standin
on a makeshift road
with the dust storm blowin
in a long black shadow
pull a hammer from a coal mine
down where your daddy was workin
comb my hair back
strike a match on a bathroom wall
where my number was written
drivin on the sidewalk
lookin back and the sky is burning
in my rearview mirror
i better go it alone"
"you said go
you said stay
got so confused
i tried to do both
so i broke out in a sweat
cashed my check
and i spent it to death
'cause its hard to compete
it's hard to eat
when you're beating your fist on the ground
and it's rude
did you ever even think about the impression
you gave to the pigs
to the kids
with the hazardous waste in their wine
and their eyes
their gasoline hairstyles
workin' their magic for you
you said go
you said stay
you said try a combination
didn't know where to start
i was lost
i was beige
i was over and under my age
like a video
like a chick
like a dead man moving to quick
in my way
had no plan
dealin' out papers into the wastecan
tryin' hard to stay awake
and the rest of the best was a big mistake
so let's drive
right into the ground
hold it down with the garbageman clown
'cause it's a deal
it's a noose
it's news
it's pennies"
"looking for my place on assembly lines
fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes
skeleton boys hyped up in purple
smoke rings blow from across the disco
bank notes burn like broken equipment
looking for shelter, readjust your position
thought control, ghostwritten confessions
two dimensions, dumb your head down
duck, don't look now, company missiles
power is raunchy, rent a cops are watching
make your dreams out of paper mache
cliched wasted hate taste tested
hell yes now i'm moving this way, i'm doing this thing
please enjoy
hell yes now i'm turning it on, i'm working my legs
hell yes now i'm calling you out, i'm switching my plates
please enjoy
hell yes now i'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct
stretched to the limit, attention spans back
retract, collapsin' the laugh tracks
noise response, applause and handclaps
floodgates open to the sound of the rainbow
breakin' points on the verge of pointless
fools anointed to the follower's fanfare
look for the common, not superficial
code red cola war conformity crisis
perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles
with magic markers running out of their ink
lives in white out, turn the lights out
fax machine anthems, get your damned hands up
hell yes now i'm moving this way, i'm doing this thing
please enjoy
hell yes now i'm turning it on, i'm working my legs
hell yes now i'm calling you out, i'm switching my plates
please enjoy
hell yes now i'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct
i like your bass.
your beat is nice.
hell yes.
hai.
hell yes."
"in the time of chimpanzees
i was a monkey
butane in my veins
so i'm out to cut the junkie
with the plastic eyeballs,
spray paint the vegetables
dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
kill the headlights

stock car flamin' with a loser
and the cruise control
baby's in reno with the vitamin d
got a couple of couches,
sleep on the love seat
someone keeps sayin'
i'm insane to complain
about a shotgun wedding
and a stain on my shirt
don't believe everything that you breathe
you get a parking violation
and a maggot on your sleeve
so shave your face
with some mace in the dark
savin' all your food stamps
and burnin' down the trailer park

i'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
soy un perdedor
i'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
banned all the music with a phony gas chamber
'cuz one's got a weasel
and the other's got a flag
one's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
with the rerun shows
and the cocaine nose job
the daytime crap of the folksinger slop
he hung himself with a guitar string
slap the turkey neck
and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
you can't write if you can't relate
trade the cash for the beef
for the body for the hate
and my time is a piece of wax
fallin' on a termite
who's chokin' on the splinters

fearful of the death

shaken to the core

trembled in the skys
sparks shot forward
causing us to fly

and everywhere around us
starvation broke on through
my husband stood a starin
at the plentiful disaster
god was in his eyes
but death was in his heart

breakdancing in the food court by yourself
with the honor and your attitude
and your jeans full of prison food
does the police chalk outline where you last been seen?
i was lacerated by my indiscretions
i was sanitized by the pinefresh smell
of a damsel in stonewashed denim
the way that her sideways ponytail fell
where were you this evening, candy apple sweetheart?
playing bass solos up on the sun
with your syntax in the post
and a clothes pin on your nose
and a septic tank full of all the stories you told
well she called me up on a chainstore pay phone
she invited me up to a condo door
way down in a neon park
to play lazer tag with her cousin, rick
where were you this morning, blue randy?
doing capoeira up on the rooftop again
with your dry ice machine
and a fist full of creatine

cause i got no mind to go or to stay,
or be left behind

with nothin' to shoot
and nowhere to lose

and pose alone
like black balloons
all banged and blown
on a backwoods river

in the stench of belief

i'm over the rails
and out of the race
and the crippled psalms
of an age that won't thaw
are ringing in my ears

that's planted on their lips
curse the sleek machine
and their iron colored ships
curse every wave that
pounds a wicked shore
curse every salesman
knocking on their door

and i am not a dog
i have no claim to be there
in the evening fog
and i am not a bone
staring through the air
have no say in anything

some of them have worn

harness the highways
lets don't be, like everyone else
with the one trip rooms,
and the halfway house
big black drums,
beating the night,
running away... thats what i like!
abandoned coal mine,
we'll have a good time
red tape rivals,
recycling bibles
lets don't be, like everyone else
with the one trip rooms,
and the halfway house
big black drums,
beating the night,"
"1, 2, you know what to do
alright
i'm uptight super
gathered out of the frame
i shake a leg on the ground
like an epileptic battery man
i'm making my move
lettin' loose like a belt
little worse for wear
but i'm wearing it well
tell me what's wrong
with a little grind n' bump?
when the stereos erupt
with a kick drum punch?
let's do it once
probably do it again and again
like you did it before
but you're more erratic than then
and you had a rough night
and the night's just begun
let a little bit of this
pass with this gun
don't let it hold you back
but you're already set
no dead flowers gonna grow
'til the dirt gets wet
put the elevator music on
pull me back where i belong
the ambulance sings along
the fly on the wall
doesn't know what's wrong
if i could forget myself
find another lie to tell
if i had a soul to sell
i'd buy some time
to talk to my brain cell
gutbucket and a bottle of paint
it's like the schoolhouse lights
will never turn on again
til the bottom wears off
of these high heeled boots
the bodies all move
some backbone roots
everybody workin' hard
'til the yard is all clean
the dishes wash good
in the washin' machine
now you brush your teeth
and you comb back your hair
you drive your vehicle
like you just didn't care
you're walkin' to work
with the boys and the girls
and you're doin' it there
it's the end of the world
now everybody's sweatin'
forgettin' what's on their mind
with your hand like a mirror
you can see what's inside
when you're down and out
conquer it, there's nothing that's real
it's like a platinum card
too amputated to feel
i got a silicon bible song
paranoid jumbotron
?? with the weekend off
the fly on the wall
doesn't know what's wrong
if i could forget myself
i'd find another lie to tell
the bottom of an oil well
cell phone's ringing
i could talk to my brain cell
all the dudes with banjos
chicks with wicks
animals with bananas
got my hand like a mirror
you can see what's inside"
"heyyy heyyy heyyy heyyy
fourteen miles away from a landfill grave
never pawned my watch and chain
to the landlord living inside my head
never paid my rent 'til the lights went dead
and i saw my sign coming up the road
dead ditch waitin' for to bury my load
on the avenues in the plain of day
threw a roosevelt dime in a bucket of rain
ohh ohh oh oh
ohh ohh oh oh
now hold your hand up to the plow
work the dirt til the sun goes down
what's left of death is more than fear
let dust be dust and the good lord near
it's a little too much to ask of faith
a little too late to wait for fate
so tell the angels what you've seen
scarecrow's shadow on the nazarene
ohh ohh oh oh
ohh ohh oh oh
kindness will find you
when darkness is falling round your bend
kindness will follow
children will wander 'til the end"
"i've seen the end of the day come too soon
not a lot to say, not a lot to do
you played the game, you owe nothing to yourself
rest a day, for tomorrow you can't tell
you can't tell
i've seen the end of the day come too late
seen the love you had turning into hate
had to act like i didn't even care
but i did so i got stranded standing there
standing there
it's nothing that i haven't seen before
but it still kills me like it did before
no it's nothing that i haven't seen before
but it still kills me like it did before
i've seen the end of the day come too soon
like the prison dogs they set out after you
you owe nothing to the past but wasted time
to serve a sentence that was only in your mind
in your mind
it's nothing that i haven't seen before
but it still kills me like it did before
no it's nothing that i haven't seen before"

we'll shoot out the great white crescent

your tangled brain,
a tired old refrain,
you’d be singing it in the tired old silence.

look at me, i'm wearing your shirt and it's burnt
dissentious morons are dissing you, dissing me
keeping the friendship in massive supply
that's why
i got no mind
i got no mind
i got no mind
give the finger to the folk singer
i'm sure he'll appreciate it deeply
and where there's smoke
and there's grease and an unperfect peace
the free 'n' easy letdown will make it all come alive
that's why
i got no mind
i got no mind
i got no mind
that's why
i got no mind
i got no mind
i got no mind
makeshift scene, mildly insulting
you really said it when you said i was just a scavenger
there's a headbangin' corpse, just take it to the source
take the plug, unplugged, plug it up, rip the plug right outta the wall
that's why
i got no mind
i got no mind

"tonight the city is full of....radios
and all the distortion pedals are melted
there's sonic youth posters nailed up onto the...ceiling
and the roof is falling down on my brain
that's why
i got no mind
i got no mind
got no mind
somebody burned down the picnic
and somebody kissed their own ass by mistake
and the cliches are gettin eaten up
by the termites with the malt liquor
and the guitar tuners and the p**** galore song
that's why
i play all night
i got no mind
feel so fine
and the big radio sound is pumping up and down
jumpin thru the hoops
making every motion seem like forever
there's air conditioning and brand new nails
and phone calls from people in chicago
...why
pay no mind
got no mind
stay outside
so turn up the levels
and talk to your devils
and bust out your tennis shoes and your mayonnaise
it's all the situations and all the celebrations
and all the contaminations that make you
breed off the carpet
that's why
i pay no mind
 got no mind
might need a cough drop
well there's verses and sounds
falling like pounds and pounds of
sand weights from the heavens
and she dangles like a bottle
talkin thru the steering wheels
and broken pantyhose
that's why
i pay no mind
sleep in slime
put out cds
the amplifiers are amplifying
the things that you never knew
could ever be the same as you
there's wires and plugs
and slugs slithering out into the paint thinner
that's why
i pay no mind
i pay no mind
got no mind
your swivel chairs and sunglasses
and your fully blown out scenes of ecstasy
turn up the volume and the treble
and call them all the nasty things that you can
stick into your paper
with your pen
shove your pen up into the air
write everything and
like you just don't care
but it feels good
when you pull off the scenery
and there's puppets and dollar bills
and there's weight loss pills
and there's cherries and there's potato chips
and the time is runnin low
and there's nowhere else to go
so let's go down
666 up into
i'm raising all my lows"
"there's a bluebird at my window
i can't hear the songs he sings
all the jewels in heaven
they don't look the same to me
i just wade the tides that turned
till i learn to leave the past behind
it's only lies that i'm living
it's only tears that i'm crying
it's only you that i'm losing
guess i'm doing fine
all the battlements are empty
and the moon is laying low
yellow roses in the graveyard
got no time to watch them grow
now i bade a friend farewell
i can do whatever pleases me
it's only lies that i'm living
it's only tears that i'm crying
it's only you that i'm losing
guess i'm doing fine
press my face up to the window
to see how warm it is inside
see the things that i've been missing
missing all this time
it's only lies that i'm living
it's only tears that i'm crying
it's only you that i'm losing

"have you got a fine place to slip to
when you're feeling down
have you had a week or two
just to get your troubles down
found a lot of life and laughter
with a grandfather in the bowery
she had a body of sixteen or seventeen
she had a mind of forty
i met her on a cold day
in a city far away
with the worlds about zero
and i saw at once,
into her soul
she's gonna call me her hero
never like a walk in the rain or the lane
i found a lot of death that day
with the grandfather in the bowery
cause i like her like the world
she had a halo of gold
told me stories of her life and the courage was sublime
pantomime
i walk the line
cause you're blind
i walk the line"
"you said go
you said stay
got so confused
i tried to do both
so i broke out in a sweat
cashed my check
and i spent it to death
and it's hard to compete
and it's hard to eat
when you're beating your teeth on the ground
and it's rude
did you ever even think about the impression
that you gave to the pigs
to the kids
with the hazardous waste in their wine
and their eyes
and their gasoline hormones
accessories accessorising
you said go
you said stay
you said try a combination
but i din't even know where to start
i was lost
i was beige
i was over and under my age
like a video
like a chick
like a dead man moving too quick
in my way
had no plan
passin' out flyers for some punk rock band
from san diego
a freak show
it's purposely out of control
soakin' it like a sponge
she's tidying up the grunge
the expectations were pulsing so pure
over rated bleakness
so hard, so easy to endure
'cause it's plain and it's real
back to the future
make a new deal
with the distortion soundin' fake
and the rest of the best was a big mistake
so let's cruise
let's freak
'cause it's payday everyday of the week"

"look up heaven's ladder
watch the angels climb down
as if they knew what was the matter
with those down on the ground
oblivious to danger
those who walk up on the clouds
they'll tumble down, down on the ground

but only further down into the hole
you could see the whole world
down below, down below, down below
where there's nowhere else to go
just as far as nowhere
and then you're on your own
anyone who's learned their lesson
and burned their hand
they'll still look at someone else's
answers if they can
'cause cheating's better than guessing
when the answer is that there's none to be had
but you'll still wonder if there's nowhere else to go
but only further down into the hole
you could see the whole world
down below, down below, down below
where there's nowhere else to go
just as far as nowhere
and then you're on your own

from the highest rung down to the lowest low

my cadillac pants going much to fast
karaoke weekend at the suicide shack
community service and i'm still the mack
shocked my finger spicing my hand
i been spreading disease all across the land
beautiful air conditioned sitting in the kitchen
wishing i was living like a hit man
face down in the guarantees
jaundiced marshalls getting busy with ease
because i get down i get down i get down all the way

western unions of the country westerns
silver foxes looking for romance
in the chain smoke kansas flashdance ass pants

you never lose in your razor blade shoes
stealing pesos out of my brain
hazard signs down the alamo lanes
radar systems using the souls
you never get caught with the wax so rotten

hijacked flavors that i'm flipping like birds

and everything will feel the same
there's no patience there's no peace
i have seen the land beyond
where the gravestones never cease

wanna clip my toenails down, down, down, down, down
and put 'em in clear plastic ziplock bags
and take them down
down to the town
in a monte carlo
with stevie nicks
the interior, white leather
and you're the last thing on my list
but you're the first thing i'm gonna remember
when i wake up
it's all gonna come to be
the same bad video for twenty years
it's all gonna come to be
optimistic xerox of yourself
it's easier when you're self made
you can pack it up and put it on the highway
you can fill up the air with bad breath
'cause it's already polluted and reconstituted
and filtered back into the system
and packaged up
and the space age is running out of distance
it can leap out
and disconnect all the connections
program the appliances to puke on the floor
it's all gonna come to be
self indulgent
yeah, it's all gonna come to be
the same old noise you never wanted to see
mexican speed metals, things
casserole fruit salad hairgel
self inflicted life affirming hell
is that slack?
is that crack?
are those dogs or are those dogmas?
are those clogs or platform shoes
on your feet
take your johnny cashmachine
and your talk about fashions that come crashin' in late at night
like a plane crash
survivors comin', pickin' out the fiberglass and styrofoam
and the love that is breathin'
is the love that is spraypainting
vandalizing everything you own
'cause it's all gonna come to be
the same bad scene for 20 years
yeah, it's all gonna come to be
optimistic xerox of yourself
predictions of debilitating health
whining all night long
whining and dining
climbing into the rafters
shredding your afro
taking karate lessons"

to harness dead horses
to ride in the sun

written in the dust
out in the mangroves

in the shadows of sulphur

they're chewing dried meat
house of disrepute
the dust of opiates
and syphilis patients
on brochure vacations
fear has a glare that traps you
like searchlights
the puritans stare
their souls are fluoresecent
the skin of a robot
vibrates with pleasure
matrons and gigolos
carouse in the parlor
their hand grenade eyes
invalid and blind
vanishes in thin air

we thought we'd get some money, we thought that we might go
spend a weekend pleasant down in mexico
i was workin at mcdonalds, doin' the latenight run
when a car pulled up the drive thru and pointed out a gun
said give us all your money and three big macs to go
i stuffed them all in a bag and i ducked down below
well the boss got angry when he found out i didn't call the police
i guess i was kinda nervous, there was a warrant out on me
concernin' some jaywalkin tickets i couldn't afford to pay
needless to say i got the axe that same day
well me bein' outta work just then i didn't wanna go home
my mom said if i lost this job i'd have to go out on my own
so i went over to dave's house and got really stoned
called up some girls but none o' them were home
steve came over and he brought some alcohol
we're all gettin really depressed just starin' at the wall
thought we'd get some money, we thought that we might go
spend a weekend pleasant down in mexico
steve's dad had a huntin' rifle and we went and picked it up
and we stopped into the 7 11 to try our luck
we raised up that huntin' rifle but the counter guy just laughed
as he pulled out an uzi we turned and hauled ass
we were runnin so fast 'til we came to the mcdonalds where i used to work
we walked up to the drive thru and gave my boss a jerk
said give us all your money and three big macs to go
and suck on this you weasel we're goin to mexico
down south we all got really wasted, dave got a case of the runs
we're all really hungover and gettin low on funds

man alive! i can't drive my two bit cares away"
"well if it ain’t your time to go
then you’d better stay put for now
cuz everybody’s gotta do their time until it’s time
and if it ain’t broken, then break it
and say you knew me way back when
when fools were fools, and all rest were swine waiting to be defiled
well i could hang up my single
out by the side of the road
and try to bang a flame out of the cinders you left behind
like a driftwood in the night
that was washed up by the light
of the moon that bleached my bones
that sent me to the pile
mustard in your smile
lend a hand on the radio dial
and the breezes of the seasons
have blown us back to hell
it’s a stolen telephone
that i dialed blind and alone
just to hear the voice of a bargain center soul
now the deserts are in flames
and the bandages are the same
and the factories, casualties are looking for mangled jewels
and if it ain’t your time to go
then you’d better stay put for now
cuz anybody gotta put their hand
upon the hand of the clock
like the minds of misers grinding down their gears to a halt"
"now i'm a seasick sailor
on a ship of noise
i got my maps all backwards
and my instincts poisoned
in a truth blown gutter
full of wasted years
like blown out speakers
ringin' in my ears
oh it's nausea, oh nausea
and we're gone
it's nausea, oh nausea
and we're gone
now i'm a straight line walker
in a black out room
i push a shopping cart over
in an aztec ruin
with my minion fingers
working for some god
who could see his own reflection
in a parking lot
oh it's nausea, oh nausea
and we're gone
no it's nausea, oh nausea
and we're gone
now i'm a priest teenager
on a tower of dust
i'm a dead generator
in a cloud of exhaust
i eat alone in the desert
with skulls for my pets
i rate the days, one to ten
with lead cigarettes
it's nausea, oh nausea
and we're gone
it's nausea, oh nausea
and we're gone"
"when the ocean's are dark
the heavens are foreboding
a chain link wind
is breaking you open
and lessons of day
on the blackboard of night
that seem to be erased
and the beacon has no light
the eyes of confusion
looking for a stray
and everything they need
keep the dogs at bay
there's no escape hatch
no submarine
can take you to the moon
and rake you in the leaves
and keep you just as safe
as you are in my arms
and someday someday
say bye bye
bye bye
bye bye
bye bye
you're smaller than a stone
bigger than a road
farther than an ocean
closer than a soul
every little word
and every little step
every new direction
closer you will get
and farther away
you go from where we are
and try to keep him with you
and hold him like a star
that has fallen frozen lake
to a heart to break
and push yourself beyond
the wall that coffins you
when you bring it down
all the false sides
when you make him yours
don't forget he's yours
bye bye"
"i'll be your chauffeur on a midnight drive
it takes a miracle just to survive
buried animals call your name
you keep on sleeping
through the poignant rain
i think we're going crazy
her left eye is lazy
she looks so israeli
nicotine and gravy
i'll feed you fruit that don't exist
i'll leave graffiti
where you've never been kissed
i'll do your laundry
massage your soul
i'll turn you over
to the highway patrol
i think we're going crazy
things don't even faze me
her left eye is lazy
nicotine and gravy
miracles amaze me
she looks so israeli
love the way she plays me
i think i'm going crazy
i don't want to die tonight
i don't want to die tonight….."
"we are aimless
and the target is an empty wall
we're out of patience
with smiles that cut across her face
no complaints
but i wish i had my top of my brain
i'd like to walk
but the sun doesn't know we're awake
we're in spaceships
take a visit to the pyranees
paid vacations
send a brochure from the agency
no complaints
but my girlfriend dug a ditch in my room
walking papers and a hole
straight out from my shoes
no complaints
but it's harder
to believe in the truth
she'll write a message
on a billboard
and i'll send it to you
we feel painless
check the status on the info line
in some ways tainted
radiation from the factory
no complaints
but it's overrated, that's for sure
take a bus back
from little rock, arkansas
or modesto

seen the love you had turning into hate
had to act like i didn't even care
but i did so i got stranded standing there
standing there
it's nothing that i haven't seen before
but it still kills me like it did before
no it's nothing that i haven't seen before

we can learn to leave these burdens to burn

with the fossils and the gypsy bones

i was the last to see me down on my knees
these antibodies learn to be the disease
and i learn to be what fights against me
make a replica, a place you can sleep
we can live in a hollow tree
grow up old and bury the sea
but when this replica begins to look cheap
i'd throw it out and now it's home to me
it's so unreal, it's all i need

mother laid in bed

gather all your worldly jewels
and scatter them like fools

days so perilous

who cares what we find
another misspent night

"satan gave me a taco and it made me really sick
the chicken was all raw and the grease was mighty thick
the rice was all rancid and the beans were so hard
i was gettin' kinda dizzy eatin' all the lard
there was aphids on the lettuce an' i ate every one
an' after i was done the salsa melted off my tongue
pieces of tortilla got stuck in my throat
an' the stains on my clothes burned a hole through my coat
my stomach was a tremblin' and i broke out in a rash
i was so dry and thirsty and i didn't have no cash
so i went and found a hose, tore off all my clothes
turned on the water and it shot right up my nose
some old lady came along and she thought i was a freak
so she beat me with a handbag till i could hardly speak
i was lying there naked, my body badly bruised
in a pool of my own blood, unconscious and confused
well, the cops came and got me and threw me in their van
and i woke up on the ceiling and i couldn't find my hand
they took me to the judge, his eyes a glowin' red
the courtroom was filled with witches and the dead
well, the sheriff was a hellhound with fangs and claws
the prisoners were tied up and chained to the walls
the air was gettin' thick; the smoke was gettin' thicker
the judge read the verdict: said, ""cut off his head!""
well, they placed me on the altar, and they raised up the axe
my head was about to explode when i noticed the marshall stacks
i noticed all the smoke machines, cameras and the lights
some guy with a microphone, runnin' around dancin' in tights
and i noticed the crew and the band playin' down below
and i realized i was in a rock video
so i went and joined the band
and i went out on tour
and i smoked a lot of heroin
and i passed out in manure
i made out with the groupies
come on here
started fires backstage
oh, yeah, started 'em all
made a lot of money
oh, yeah, i'm makin' it
and i gave it all away
give it all to me
well, the band got killed
ah, bunch of losers
so i started a solo career
aha, yeah
and i won all the awards
get 'em all now
and i drank all the beer
drink it all up; get funky
i opened up a taco stand

the quiet street we're standing on

with the devil tryin to take my mind

thru the dust and the clouds

and the junkyard piles
i wanted hope from a grave
i wanted strength from a slave

might be the end of you then
crows are pullin at my clothes

over all the treasures we lost

like a guillotine rose
a photograph
a low life laugh
we'll shoot for the empire
land in the dust pile
i want to wake up
in the shadow of a fever pitch
with the gold glass heart
sending messages
i hear the voice over the phone
she pauses
says 'i'll never, never, never go'
oh can i stay here with you?
oh can i stay here with you?
now i'm dead to the world

going by
going by

another ship in a bottle

tell me what i know
about the kind of life
i never thought i'd live
till the ugly truth
showed me what it did

what a friend could tell me now
on a borrowed dime
in different light
you might see what
the other side looks like
in a random room
behind an iron door
kick an empty can
across an empty floor

what a friend could tell me now"
"a town of disrespect
the trains are wrecked
the night is younger than us
and nowhere is anywhere else
you sleep to yourself
stirring the dregs
where i have laid
the exit signs are flashing
dead ends, they won't
come to life anymore
well i pledged the rest
i should have guessed
your love was hangin by threads
tongues tied under the moon
your love is a room
of broken bottles and tangled webs
the miser's wild
them eyes like clocks
that cock their gears
on and on
and if it's meant some accident
or some coincidence
crumbs fall out of the sky
as you wander by
the dust clouds roam,
nobody's home
so lay my bags upon
all the funeral fire
and sing it again"

i have to warm this frozen, icy, lonely heart to thaw
i like being wrapped with warmness more than anything else for sure
i'm gonna make my coming days to be filled with laughter and joy
i let myself down that i'm more cruel than i thought i would be
i'm just a loser who ends up by caring for my soul
i don't give my heart to no one cause i don't wanna waste my time
i tried to love this loneliness to slip out of lonesome hole
sorrow is what i hate but it's grown by sensations
regrets tought me how to make any hard decisions
peace is always by my side but i've never felt it once
love is not the word only for the sweet romance
well i'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
and i'm scared to keep on going on my way
well i'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
and i'll tell myself i'm special 'till the end
recalling my torn, broken, aching heart of these long days
and all the memories i wanted to forget for making leaps
recalling, breaking, aching, crying, making sure to me
and i take all and grin at my future on the way
sorrow is what i hate but it's grown by sensations
regrets tought me how to make any hard decisions
peace is always by my side but i've never felt it once
love is not the word only for the sweet romance
well i'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
and i'm scared to keep on going on my way
well i'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
and i'll tell myself i'm special 'till the end...
i don't give my heart to no one cause i don't wanna waste my time
i tried to love this loneliness to slip out of lonesome hole

sooner or later at the end of the world
see you on the other side of love all alone

"yea
she said you better stay, stay right where you are
i might get knocked down by a falling star
set you straight before you hurt yourself somewhere
sinking like a stone 
and she's working at the meaning of the game
on the taciturn reflection of her face
days and days i've faced so amazed
i take myself on the georgia main
she's got the coin of the realm
and the hounds of hell
she's ringing the bell
holding on to herself
she's got the light in her eyes
and the proof of the sky
she's crossing my mind
better hold on to myself
shimmy shimmy shake, the lights are on
taking the time to get me gone
she's walking crooked down the hall
falling down the waterfall
shimmy shimmy shake, the lights are on
taking the time to get me gone
she's walking crooked down the hall
falling down the waterfall

"can you feel it in the airwaves
rollin down the lane
black out in the background
standin in your veins
mmmmm
nothin that i wouldn't say to you
can you teach it to the prisoners
can you throw it at the wall
you leap into the altitudes
see just where you fall
mmmmm
nothin that i wouldn't take from you
can you fit it in the system
can you put it in a word
static and distortion
is all you ever heard
mmmmm"
"put me in a hole in the ground
with the money and the towel
and the women all runnin' around
can't complain about the mess
momma killed the only dress
now she's longin' for the pines
watch my troubles all unwind
drinkin' gasoline and wine
catch a chill off the stove
on the train they cannot feel
lost my head beneath the wheel
now she steals my body home
the trees are fake, the air is dead
the birds are stuffed with poison lead
and the ground is much too clean
and if it's only me who's scared
strap 'em to the electric chairs
ring the moon like a broken bell
when she drags you from the hill
daddy's gonna burn down the still
we can watch it from the rooftop
lay in to the fryin' pan
now she kisses her own hand
with the fiddle on the fire
i took a leap into the fog
sleepin' on a hollow log
now i'm coughin' with no mouth
you can keep yourself inside
but you know you cannot lie"

the street fair was an ocean
when he took three tabs of bad acid

"lord, please don't forsake me
in my mercedes benz
all the riches and the ruins
now we all know how that story ends
strange apparition
haunting my brain
standing on the last legs
of a dream that walked away
when the lord rings my front door
and asks me what i got to show
besides the dust in my pockets
and the things that just eat away my soul
strange apparition
haunting my brain
there's some permissions
of a dream that got cremated
the least i had to lose from
is the most i seem to care
anything should make you happy
nothing could make you scared
we'll be on the shoreline
when that heavy ship goes down
did you think that you were lucky?
you should see yourself now"

and we will rise in the cool of the evening
i remember the way that you smiled
when the gravity shackles were wild
and something is vacant when i think it's all beginning
i've been drifting along in the same stale old shoes
loose ends tying a noose in the back of my mind
if you thought that you were making your way

vision goes with the sun
far above the ground
halfway to oblivion
in the stratosphere
there's nowhere to go from here

high as the moon
earth below to comfort me
needle to the spoon
strike a match and let it be
in the stratosphere
there's nowhere to go from here

somewhere i can disappear
in the stratosphere
there's nowhere to go from here

sirens and people and everything
the driver tried to swerve
but he just didn't see ya
now you're buried 'neath the wheel
just like a tortilla
here comes that bus
right into your face
now you're flying
now you're flying home

sometimes you meet a fireman
sometimes you meet a dancer
this is one ride where you won't need no transfer

stranded in infinity rooms
and they're safe from any harm

sweating in the meadow of fate
scratch me gently

it breaks for you and me

decisions lie with foolish man
alone with my life
and they're chockin' and holdin' me
expecting me to fall
but only if i threaten
we'll see the tables turn
and when the thunder breaks
it breaks for you and me

"i got a room down in hollywood
rent was cheap
it was this rooming house
there was an old man who lived in the room next to me
we shared a bathroom in the hall
stare at me through a crack in the door
day i moved in i was playin' my guitar
started bangin' on the wall with a boot
then he came out, started banging on my door
kicked it open
watch out son, i got a tasergun
watch out son, i got a tasergun
he's on the loose
he's got the juice
like a mad dog with no teeth
spent his pension in adult bookstores
bringin strange young men home
he'd leave me notes in the bathroom
accusin' me of stealin' his toilet paper
come out into the hallway
dressed up in a greasy bathrobe
tryin' to start a fight
he became known as the electric old man
and i still see him with his taser
comin' at me
watch out son, i got a tasergun
watch out son, i got a tasergun
he's on the loose

"i got a room down in hollywood

he was so wretched
he ate up everything
the day i moved in
i got weird feelings
i played my guitar
he hit the ceiling
he ran out into the hall and he yelled
""watch out, son, i've got a taser gun!
watch out, son, i've got a taser gun!""
he's on the loose
he's got the juice
like a mad dog with no teeth
he left me notes
said all kinds of things
""you little creepy slob,
why don't you get a job?
why don't you cut your hair?
why don't you get out of here?
why don't you move away?
why don't you just get lost?""
he spent his days
down in adult book stores
bringing home all kinda weirdos
and blasting his tv back at me
so one day i get pissed
we got into a fight
i kicked him in the nuts
he yelled with all his might

it's a treacherous road
with a desolated view

the nations repainted
the chain gang chatelaine

the anthem of normal
the horrible fanfare
the horns get distorted

cowards towered around it
power line buzzards
surveilling the night
talons in flight
the fake horizons ignite
banality lives where hysteria kills
civilian jungles with malaria pills
animals bleed to buy a star from the night
avenue kids wear a scar like a stripe
send up a signal to the heavenly rescue
when the poison's coming from the person you're next
to
let the voltage of thought pull the plug from the
wound
cos if the soul is a symptom the condition is you
   
we know its a letterbomb hand me down
this thought is a perjury blindfold
when she crawls from the himalayan highway rain
with her birds of prey and her weapons on the fire
she?s riding a land slide down to me
she?s cutting the shackles off of me
she?s shaking the dead birds from the trees
she?s takin the only air i breathe
iron lungs and a plate glass sermon
don?t call it death on the installment plan
she pulling the armor from my back
and raking the coals over the tracks
and taking the knife out from the stack
she?s bringing the blood that i had back
she?s coming to see its all a sin
coming to see the sun again
coming to wash it off again
coming to see her self again"

rockin' softly

funk so illegal i think i might need a lawyer
not a firestarter but my beats get hotter

hanukkah pimp on a check
like a micro rock gettin' in a sweat neal's mackin' track
ejaculatin' on buffet tables and record labels
willin' and able
bring my funk in place of each beat lifestyles of the slick and sleazy
spin around and around like a dreidel
kind of science that puts you back in the cradle
shit, sometimes this track's so poignant
somebody please pass me some kind of ointment
put these rhymes together like a thief
clear up your nose like a eucalyptus leaf
dropping science, you don't even know what hits you
next thing you know you're 13 and get a bar mitzvah

"hello, can i help you?
yeah, do you do fat grafting?
yes.
oh great. i had a tail put on by dr. gordon.
ok.
and i want to have some fat grafted onto it. i want to thick it up.
you have some fat where?
well, i have a tail attached to my spine and i want to thicken it up. i want it to be bigger.
oh.
would that be the botox injection? or would that be the fat grafting?
ok, hold on a second. i don't think you have the right person.
ok, no problem.
thanks for holding. may i help you?
hi, yeah. i had a tail put on about 4 years ago, attached to my spine and i've got some hair growing on it that i need to get...
well, come and get rid of it!
that's why i'm calling you! can i come in tonight?
actually, you can come in for a consultation. let me tell you how we work here.
ok, please.
sure. first of all, one session is not going to get rid of your hair. that's because hair grows in three phases. all human bodies need at least three sessions of laser treatment. and i say ""at least"" because if you're talking about let's say your beard, you may need up to eight.
well, this is my tail.
right, so then you obviously will need less. but i just want to educate you about, you know, different body parts.
right.
so depending on the amount of hair you have, it will tell you how many sessions you will need.
but here is the best part of how we work.
what's that?
we offer you different types of enrollment. so if, let's say, we quote you a price... let's say, fifty dollars. you can pay as you go, every time you come in, fifty dollars. or if you pay for three sessions up front, we will give you two complementary sessions. and that's our way of guaranteeing that your hair won't come back. because we definitely don't want to see you five times for the same area. we try to give you the type of treatment that's gonna be effective. so if we do see you, hopefully it will be for a different body part.
do you need to get the other line?
umm, no, let's let it go. i'm fascinated by what you're saying. ok, so this is what we do here. you come in, you watch a five minute video, because we like our patients to be astute about what they're getting into. we do guarantee the lowest price, that the machine we use is the latest technology in the market today for hair removal. and we basically take a deposit from you because without the deposit we cannot book the time of the machine for your use.
ok.
and that's how we work.
that sounds great. i see here upper lip is 29 dollars, underarm is $39, bikini line $49, arm $119.
yep.
how much for a tail?
umm, it really depends. it really depends. it really...
it's about four feet long.
four feet?
yeah.
ok. you're talking about your head, right? your head tail?
no. i have a tail attached to my spine.
a tail attached to your spine? on the lower spine?
yeah.
and that was because of a surgery?
yeah.
i see. and uh, ok, when you say four feet. .four feet is the length of your hair?
no, it's the length of my tail.
wow. that's a long tail.
and you guys just do laser hair removal?
no, actually we do microderm abrasion. we do lazer resurfacing. we do body contouring with endymology.
do you do botox injections?
i'm a semi amateur bodybuilder and weightlifter.
then you should do your whole chest, your back, your legs!
well, i want my face just to look like, you know, like, like care, you know.
i know what you mean.
let me tell you how it works. they take a virus, they beat it up with a hammer, literally. ok, they make you weak, then they inject that weak virus into your muscle. botulism virus causes paralysis, ok? so it basically temporarily paralyzes a muscle. usually facial muscles, whatever.
right.
well, here's what happens. the body's normal reaction to a traditional virus is antibody release. ok, so now antibodies are going to come up to fight this virus.
you know what? i don't have time for this. i'm not wasting time here.
ok, i'm a semi amateur weightlifter and i've got a competition coming out. and i don't know what the hell i'm gonna do. i look like an idiot. she injected the botox into my face and it completely killed my face."
