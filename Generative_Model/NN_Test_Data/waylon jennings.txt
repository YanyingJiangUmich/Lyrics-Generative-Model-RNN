i guess its too late now but somehow i must make you see
what we thought wes our world was only a dream world
and we just can't go on like this
anita your dreaming of a world that can never exist
anita it's over there's nothing that's left now to say
anita your dreaming and i know it's better this way
anita come closer and close your pretty blue eyes
your young dreams just can't be and somehow you must realize
that each time your with me my conscious reminds me
of someone who's waiting alone

anita your dreaming and i know it's better this way"

i'm no child of destiny and no fortune's son
i've just chased you so long now i'm too weak to run
a new day is here but nothing is new alone in my room i tremble for you
i know i'll return to the backstreets again to find what i need to prove i'm a man
and there i'll treat shame like an old friend from home
that i can lean on till my mis'ry is gone
a new day is here and nothing is new i'm a picture of weakness as i tremble for you"
"down the street a baby just cried when he woke up all alone
a train's leavin' town and that lonesome old sound is chilling me right to the bone
a song is playing i can barely hear about a love that's gone wrong
the freezing rain on my window pane listen they're playing my song
taps being played by a soldier's grave so sad it torments your soul
just listen to that north wind moan tonight it's so dark and cold
somewhere a siren cuts through the night sounds like a whole world's gone wrong
thunder just warned but it's coming a storm listen they're playing my song"

god only knows why she gave herself to a guy like you
she called me cryin' said she was gonna have your baby
you just turned your back on her like all cowards do
i swore i'd get you for what you're puttin' her through
and the only reason i ain't got you jamie cried and begged me not to
she still loves you for some reason

"today there's no salvation band's packed up and gone
i'm left standing with my penny in my hand
down at railroad station a blind man sings his song
i think he sees things i don't understand
it's the 33rd of august and i'm finally touching down
eight days from sunday finds me saturday bound
i stumbled through the darkness tumble to my knees
a thousand voices screaming in my brain
wound up in a squad car busted down for vacancy
outside my cell it's sure as hell looks just like rain
it's the 33rd of august...
i've put my dangerous feelings under lock and chain
killed my violent nature with a smile
let the demons danced and sang their songs within my fevered brain
not all my god like thoughts were defiled
it's the 33rd of august..."

and a little on the carpet and floor
i covered it up with mom's coat from the closet

not like i thought it would be
i've had a bad,bad day

i put some sand in my grandpa's tobacco
and he frowned at me all day
then i hid his pipe 'cause it smells when he smokes it

she's a good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man
she loves him in spite of his wicked ways she don't understand
through teardrops and laughter

i'll admit i've taken things i never should of took
you can read a different story in a lot of different books
but even then you won't really know
how it was a long time ago
women have been my trouble since i found out they weren't men
in spite of that i stopped and took a wife now and then
they built their fences high but they couldn't hold me in
i was born with a fire down below
and i learned to fly a long time ago
don't ask me about the years i spent out in the rain
about the ones i spent in love or the ones i spent insane
don't ask me who i gave my seat to on that plane
i think you already know
i told you that a long time ago
me and ol' willie,lordy we've been sold and bought
i guess you all heard about some kind of system that we fought
we ain't the only outlaws just the only ones they caught
they tried to run us off but willie's slow
i quit running a long time ago"

suddenly it got real lonely here
i know the words i could have said
to make her turn around

the rest would have been easy
together in the dark
we could have found that old time feeling
that we lost somewhere somehow
but a lot of good it's gonna do me now
still thinking about the things i could have said
and looking at her picture by the bed
i realized just what i've lost as i pulled the covers down
but a lot of good it's gonna do me now
i could have told her i was sorry
and really meant it from the heart

since the whiskey and the women started winnin' his time
they rode him high and hard to the ground
he remembers the thrill of bein' a winner in the days of his first rodeo
but there's somethin' about winning that didn't last forever
maybe tomorrow things'll get better if devil lets loose of his soul
he'll be be the all around cowboy again

i have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
all lies and jests still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest
when i left my home and my family
i was no more than a boy in the company of strangers
in the quiet of the railway station running scared
laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
looking for the places only they would know
asking only workman's wages
i come looking for a job but i get no offers
just a come on from the whores on seventh avenue
i do declare there were some times when i was so lonesome
and i took some comfort there
in the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
and he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down
and cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
i am leaving i am leaving but the fighter still remains"

"when you're weary feeling small when tears are in your eyes i'll dry them all
i'm on your side oh when times get rough and friends just can't be found
like a bridge over troubled water i will lay me down
like a bridge over troubled waters i will lay me down
when you're down and out when you're on the street
when evening falls so hard i will comfort you
i'll take your part when darkness comes and pain is all around
like a bridge over troubled water i will lay me down
like a bridge over troubled waters i will lay me down
sail on silver girl sail on by your time has come to shine
all the dreams are on their way
see how they shine if you need a friend i'm sailing out behind
like a bridge over troubled water i will lead your mind
like a bridge over troubled water i will lead your mind"
"verse:
there's a bible on the dresser,
and a sign hung on the door,
and a woman in my arms that shouldn't be.
i'm to the point of no returning,
but i've been here before.
this cheating life is nothing new to me.
there's someone to be considered,
i call her on the phone,
and say the job is taking longer than i planned
i dont have the heart to tell her,
that a stranger turned me on,
and i'm heading for the broken promise land
chorus:
tonight i'm crossing over
and i'll reach the cheating side
and i'll hate myself for coming here again.
where the streets are paved with misery
and lives are built on lies,
the place they call the broken promise land
verse:
found the note left on the dresser,
and the key left in the door,
and on the floor i found her golden wedding band.
guess she finally had to tell me,
she's not waiting here no more,
and she heading for the broken promise land.
chorus:
tonight she's crossing over
and she'll reach the cheating side
and i'll hate myself for giving her the chance.
'cause the streets are paved with misery
and lives are built on lies.
the place they call the broken promise land.
...and its more than i can stand."
"flying across the desert in a twa
i saw a woman walking across the sand
she been a walkin' thirty miles en route to l.a.
to get a brown eyed handsome man
her destination was a brown eyed handsome man
milo venus was a beautiful lass
she had the world in the palm of her hand
but she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
to get a brown eyed handsome man
she fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man
chorus:
way back in history three thousand years
back every since the world began
there's been a lot of good women shed a tear
for a brown eyed handsome man
that's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man
beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
between a doctor and a lawyer man
her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
a brown eyed handjust like your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man
arrested on charges of unemployment
he was sitting in the witness stand
the judge's wife called up the district attorney
said you free that brown eyed man
you want your job you better free that brown eyed man
way back in history three thousand years
back every since the world began
there's been a lot of good women shed a tear
for a brown eyed handsome man
that's what the trouble is brown eyed handsome man"
"my bills are all due and the baby needs shoes but i'm busted
cotton is down to a quarter a pound and i'm busted
i got a cow that's gone dry and a hen that won't lay
a big stack of bills gettin' bigger each day
the county will haul my belongings away cause i'm busted
i went to see my brother gonna ask him for a loan i was busted
i hate to beg like a dog for a bone but i'm busted
my brother said there ain't one thing i can do
wife and the kids they're all down with the flu
i was just thinking about calling on you cause i'm busted
i ain't no thief but a man can go wrong when he's busted
the food that we canned last summer is gone and i'm busted
well the fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow
me and my family gotta pack up and go
i'll make a living but where i don't i'm just busted"
"i gave my heart i gave my all you built me up then you let me fall
you wore my ring upon your hand but then you changed your mind
but that's all right i looked around and found true love
you made me laugh you made me cry i wished that day that i could die
you never dreamed that by and by i'd be glad you changed your mind
yes that's all right i looked around and found true love"
"when the morning sun streaks across my room
and i'm wakened up from another dream of you
yes i'm on the road once again it seems
all i've left behind is a chain of broken dreams
but you know i love you yes i love you oh i love you
how i wish this love was all we'd need to live
what a life we'd have cause i've got so much to give
and it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
that the dollar sign chould be keeping us apart
but you know i love you yes i love you oh i love you
and if only we could find our way back to the times
when the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
for the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
i'd come running back to you i'd come running back to you
but you know we can't live on dreams alone
and to pay the rent got us leave you all alone
but you know i made my choice many years ago
now this traveling life is the only one i know
but you know i love you yes i love you oh i love you
yes you know i love you yes i love you oh i love you"
"do you remember cactus texas nothing but a wide place in the road
eighteen wheelers never go there main street's just too narrow for the load
a little town of honest people some we haven't seen for quite awhile
i was young and restless and we both were full of dreams and running wild
we left our old hometown and family barely had a nickel to our name
we were out to win the world not once looking back or losing aim
we hit the big town and the big time not a lot of effort in the deal
but in the bargain we lost touch with one another and old feelings that were real
in a big house up on easy street where too much never seems to be enough
we're not the same two people far away from all the days when the times were rough
including you and i is separated by a wall
it's not something we can talk about in fact we seldom even talk at all
i don't think we realize how or why we ever came this far
let's go back to cactus texas maybe once we're there we'll find out where we are"
"go west young man the signs all seem to say there's san diego frisco or la

expose the lonely corners of your mind to a little dad of that california sunshine
i need a change i've headed up to here she's just playing game that's very clear
but her play mate will soon be hard to find cause i'll be in that california sunshine
they say those california girls are fine they know how to really walk your mind
well one of you get ready cause you're mine i'm headin' for that california sunshine
i need a change i've headed...
baby i'll be in that california sunshine"
"gonna catch a freight train as far as i can lord i don't care which way it goes

"i've been quite the traveler ever since i hit the road
and the sullen county carnival has been my earn in gold
i've been quite alone since i remember when
i turned my ultimatums into chips and cashed them in
i used to run the ferris wheel but that'd be hard to prove
i can't stand to see a rolling wheel propped up so it can't move
i used to run the carousel hell that's just round and round
never liked to see them ponies painted up and bolted down
the only thing that keeps me from staying here is leaving
the only thing that saves me from it all is i'll be gone
just when i could trust in all the things that i believe in
i had to pack it up and move along
and i'll tell you the boys i'm not the only one
i was a straight man at the ring toss but that was just a jaunt
i can't see throwing rings around things you don't really want
i could run the roller coaster but that might break my heart
so much hard travelin' just to wind up where you start
now i just work the gateway and i'm pretty satisfied
little booth is red and blue and i just sit inside
i just take your money and give tickets out in trade
think about my life and all the promises i made
the only thing that keeps me from staying here is leaving...
who's running from the things they've left undone"
"casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walkin' down
the stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
of silent desperation never speaking to a soul
the poison air he's breathing has the dirty smell of dyin'
cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
of the clicking of the turn stops and the rattle of his chains
oh she said casey it's been so long since i've seen you
here she said just a kiss to make a body smile
see she said i've put on new stocking just to please you
lord she said casey can you only stay a while
casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown
for something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
who reach for anything they can to keep from goin' home
standing in the corner casey drinks his final bitter
never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
then he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
oh she said i suppose you seldom think about me
now she said now that you've a family of your own
still she said it's so blessed good to feel your body
lord she said casey it's a shame to be alone hmm"
"i got a gal in cedartown georgia
used to have to walk nearly three miles to court her
she never had much; just a sharecropper's daughter
but i married her and took her down to new orleans, got a little house in the south french quarter
got a job hookin' bait an’ loadin ‘um on the steamboat
i gave her seven days pay, next day i’m broke
when she ain't a’sleepin' all day, she's a primpin'
every evenin' when the sun goes down, she starts a’swarmin' on orlean town
walkin' to work this mornin' at daybreak
caught her with a tall dark dandy from canebreak
she walked right by me and she looked right through me
i made up my mind what i'm a gonna do: eased in the pawnshop and bought a 22
i watched as the room clerk gave them a room key
standin' outside i could read room 23
tonight i'll put her on a train for georgia
gonna be a lotta kinfolk squallin' and a’grieving, ‘cause that cedartown gal ain't breathing"
"if i should get a look of leavin' in my eyes
put your arms round me woman and change my mind
if i ever seem too restless or dissatisfied
put your arms round me woman and change my mind
don't let me seperate your love from mine
don't let me leave you i might get the urge some time
if i do you'll know what to do to keep me by your side
put your arms round me baby and change my mind
if the g** life of the barrooms beckons me at night
put your arms round me baby and change my mind
and if a new love ever tempts me that i should search to find
put your arms round me woman and change my mind
put your arms round me woman and change my mind"
"i only meant to love you don't you know it babe
why couldn't you be contented with the love i gave
i've given you my heart and now you want my mind
your love scares me to death girl it's the chokin' kind
you can kill a man with bullets poison or a knife
but it hurts him more to take his pride and run his life
whatever it is you want girl i hope you find
but that hat don't fit my head it's the chokin' kind
when you fall in love again girl take a tip from me
if you don't like the peaches walk on by the tree
find what you want and keep it treat it sweet and kind
but let it breathe don't make your love the chokin' kind"
"their eyes were upon me as they sat they're drinking
their hands reach up for you with lust in their hearts
as you dance away i know just what they're thinking
as i watch them watch you it just tears me apart
dance while my heart breaks christina
dance to the strings of your shame and my sorrow
i'll take you home when it's over to dream all the dreams of a brighter tomorrow
your eyes fall out at them and the crowd all goes wild
to them you're just a woman to go with their wine
i look at you and all i can see is a child
hating the world makes you old before your time
dance while my heart breaks christina...
dance while my heart breaks christina..."
"down by the river where the big boats go by
each day you could see them as evening was nigh
they planned to be married at the first sign of spring
and jim would take cindy to see new orleans
the town folks would smile as they sat there alone
jim talked of the day he'd make cindy his own
he saved his money to buy her a ring and take his sweet cindy to see new orleans
one day a riverboat gambler chanced by
and captured her heart with his sweet words and lies
he told her come with me and you'll be a queen
so they left together to see new orleans
each day you can see jim though years have gone by
down by the river where the big boats go by
she wrote she'd return at the first sign of spring
he's waiting for cindy to see new orleans"

i see her face in every wave her lips kiss every breeze
her loving arms reach out for me through calm and stormy seas
at night i pace the lonely deck caressed by memories
cindy oh cindy...
i know my cindy's waitin' as i walk the dock alone
her loving arms reach out for me soon i'll be headin' home
then my sailing days will be over and no more will i roam

rain is in my eyes and i can't see life's become just cloudy days
why she's done me like she's done i guess i'll never know
she knows i need her more than anyone i've made a point to let it show
cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore stormy weather will you always be around
when i'm down i can't stand cloudy days
i recall the time when times were good lord they seem so long ago
but you know they say if rain don't come then love has no chance to grow
cloudy days don't the sun..."

just another day
before the meeting of our minds and
what you had to say
it's been a long time comin' and
i guess i never saw
i'll have a short time adjusting to it all
you have come to your conclusion
you no longer care for me
and that we don't belong together
i suppose we sould agree
there is nothing i can do
now that you've made up your mind
but could you come back and see me sometime
chorus:
is there any way that you could leave a little at a time
i need the time to make adjustments of the heart and of the mind
it might be that you'll remember some old feeling left behind
and if you do would you come back and see me sometime
i am left with no defenses
for i have no control
and for the first time in my manwood
i'll do what i am told
it's all over but the leaving you're
determined now to do
i'll have the burden of gettin' over you
there's no need to be suspicious i have
nothing left to hide
it's all out in the open i have
nothing left inside
just seeing you would be enough
it's all i have in mind
so could you come back see me sometime

come on home and sing the blues to daddy
when things don't work out the way you planned
come on home and sing the blues to daddy tell it all to one who understands
like a child that's found a brand new plaything
each one is more fun than those before

to be picked up and kicked around once more

"now blue ain't the word for the way that i feel
and the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
this ain't no crazy dream i know that it's real
you're someone else's love now you're not mine
crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
while my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
my troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed

so take all the treasured dreams i had for you and me

pretending out loud but it don't seem the same

and my part of the crowd is not with me tonight
i remember the times each dance with you all those crazy things that we used to do
sometimes we'd wait for the dance and then steal away
from the crowd and the dance till i hide away
oh but you're gone and it's not the same old game
i fall apart everytime i hear your name
i'll go on with the crowd of make believe
till you come back to me run back to me hurry back to the crowd and me"

i could smile for a while
but when i saw you last night
you held my hand so tight
when you stopped to say hello
and though you wished me well
you couldn't tell
that i'd been
crying over you
crying over you
then you said so long
left me standing all alone
alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
it's hard to understand
that the touch of your hand
can start me crying
i thought that i was over you
but it's true, so true
i love you even more
than i did before
but darling, what can i do
oh you don't love me
and i'll always be
crying over you
crying over you
yes, now you're gone
and from this moment on
i'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
i'm crying, crying

"just a kid with a song when he wandered from home in
search of the phantom of fame
she promised she'd wait but he got back too late
just a scene from the dark side of fame
in the wrong frame of mind he took to the wine
holding pieces of love's broken chain
it was colder than jade in this world that he'd made
all alone on the dark side of fame
his songs were soon curled on the lips of the world
they earned him the highest of claim
and yet his greatest desire was the simple warmth of
love's fire
cause it's cold on the dark side of fame
the wine took its toll and soon he grew old much
younger than most people do
but there's no trace of shame in the sound of his name
though he lived on the dark side of fame he lived on
the dark side of fame"
"deep in the west where the tall mountains grow i've gone home
where the heavens above turn red from the fire down below
are you listening to me when i'm talking to you
said together we're one divided we're through
divided we're through
silver friend at night yellow friend you come with the dawn
back in my heart i've been drying my eyes see me run
so you hang on to me and i'll hang on to you
said together we're one divided we're through
divided we're through
refusing to talk i suppose that it's all for love's sake
and learning to give that's important before you can take from me
are you listening to me when i'm talking to you
said together we're one divided we're through
so you hang on to me and i'll hang on to you
said together we're one divided we're through
divided we're through"

prettiest woman you ever had laid eyes on

delta dawn what's that flower you have on could it be a faded rose of days gone by
did i hear you say he was meetin' you here today
to take you to his mansion in the sky
she's forty one and her daddy still calls her baby

looking for a mysterious dark haired man

didn't we shine
didn't we share and care

maybe it wasn't meant to last

in the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table

here i sit drivin' nails in the wall...
in the wilted patterns of my mind find that i've left you behind
sowing up my torn memories
surviving living three bed room electric kitchen and living room

i ain't seen it all but it's plain to see
i just might be an endangered species

with the new hats snapping at my heels
i ain't sure what it's all about
i ain't in but don't count me out
bridge 2:
they all like to dance but if you want to dance with me
you might be dancing with an endangered species
i wasted some time
with some women i found
at no time ever settlin' down
with one over here and one over there

i am the entertainer had to pay my price
things i didn't know at first i learned by doing twice
but still they come to haunt me still they want their say
so i learn to dance with my hands in my pants
rub my neck and just write 'em a check and they'll be on their way

when i walk along some railroad track and find
that you're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry

though the wheet fields and the clothes lines
and the junk yards and the highways come between us
and some other woman 's cryin' to her mother cause she turned and i was gone
i still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
and the summer sun might burn me till i'm blind
but not to where i cannot see you walking on the back roads
by the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
i dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin' cracklin' caltron in some train yard
my beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
through cupped hands round a tin can i pretend to hold you to my breast and find
that you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry

is dead but for a dreaming grey eyes you know
we never had much money grey eyes you know
more rainy days than sunny grey eyes you know
and life has been a long hard road to hoe
but you stuck right by me smiling grey eyes you know
hard times took the blue from your eyes
leaving them grey as the winter's skies

and only one way out of a motel room
payments on the cadillac and too many questions
and old guitars that just won't stay in tune
you know there's good and bad breaks you learn from your mistakes
it's all in how you handle them do's and don'ts

my love keeps a growing cause your love keeps a showing
just enough to keep me hangin' on

hank you were my inspiration
and i was obsessed with your ways
but to tell you the truth
it's no thanks to you

you'll always be
a hero to me

our day is slipping on by

"he went to paris lookin' for answers to questions
that bothered him so
he was impressive,young and agressive
savin' the world on his own
warm summer breezes,french wine and cheeses
put his ambition at bay
the summers and winters scattered like splinters
and four or five years slipped away
he went to england,played the piano,and married
an actress named kim
they had a good life,she was a good wife
and bore him a young son named jim
all of the answers and all of the questions
he locked in his attic one day
'cause he liked the quiet clean country livin'
and twenty more years slipped away
war took his baby,bombs killed his lady and left him
with only one eye
his body was battered,his whole world was shattered
all he could do was just cry
while the tears were fallin' he was recallin'
answers that he never found
so he hopped in a freighter,skidded the ocean
and left england without a sound
now he lives in the islands,fishes the pilin' and drinks
his green label each day
writing his memoirs,losin' his hearin'
but he don't care what most people say
after eighty six years of perpetual motion
if he likes you he'll smile and say
""jimmy,some of it's magic,probably tragic,
but i had a good life all the way""

that bothered him so"

heartache number two was when you came back again
you came back but never meant to stay

every day you love me less each day i love you more
i've got heartaches by the numbers a love that i can't win
but the day that i stop counting that's the day my world will end
heartache number three was when you called me
you said that you were coming back to stay
with hopeful heart i waited for your knock on my door
i waited but you must have lost your way
i've got heartaches by the numbers..."
"i called you on the phone to say i love you that i stop by for you at nine
my heart broke when you said that it's all over
someone else would take up all your time
and that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
i'll never know what made you change your mind
i only know i've held you close and kissed you my last time
that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
i went downtown to join the marry makers i told myself that here's where i belong
i thought that i was doin' fine without you and then i heard somebody play our song
and that's a lot of heartaches for a dime...
that's a lot of heartaches for a dime"

i'm turning over a new leaf gonna get myself in gear
cause i've got a woman who's better than most
and i've made a mess of her plans
so startin' today all i'm gonna be is her man
i've been a wild catter and a go go getter
been an sob right down to the letter
i've had misadventures i even got pictures
of even more than i can stand
so startin' today all i want a be is her man
i'm gonna give it all back cause all i've done is take
i've put her on the back burner while i was out on the make
but i've got a woman who's good enough to give me
a second chance again
so starting today all i'm gonna be is her man
i've been a wild catter and a go go getter...
i'm a little bit late but i'm wise enough
i'm taking her by the hand
startin' today all i want a be is her man"

that i could be a child again
take my 50 cents and go down to the local picture show
to watch my heroes rope and ride
most times they'd win but when they'd lose it always made me cry
ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die
one by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all
well i guess the fish just ain't bitin' just as well it don't feel like fightin'
all in all it just ain't that great a fishin' day that old newspaper headline
kind of wrapped around this old heart of mine another big one got away

one by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all"

as of today there's gonna be some changes made

anything to the talk i hear over town
is it really true girl that you go on the deck up and down
now the word as well as i can recall
everywhere you've been you've been the belle of the ball
it's high time you quit your lowdown ways
i remember one time now way back down on the farm
my daddy had a dominiker hen but she wouldn't stay home
well now she could fly higher than a jet airplane
but not after daddy clipped her little ol' wings
it's high time you quit your lowdown ways"

no need to talk cause i'm alone
if i stay here they're gonna lock me in

hittin' the bottle again ever than i've drunker been

in and out of every joint in this town
the city life has really got me down

i'm gonna slap my boogie underneath my arm
scud right back in my pappy's farm

did everything that needs done

why was it always turning out be me

where does it go,the good lord only knows
it seems like it was just the other day
i was down at green gables,hawking them tables

for loveable losers,no luck can't boozers
and honky tonk heroes like me

she tried to make me upstairs for a ride
she had to carry me right across her shoulder

gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme the honky tonk girl
i met her either say in new york city i had to put het a one heck of a fight
the lady said she'd covered me with roses
she broke my nose and then she broke my mind

i've turned away from everything and everyone that wanted to be mine
somehow i always shot my eyes and heart to anything that i might share
now i'm standing still and i wonder how long have you been there
every path i've taken i've turned around and quickly closed the door
it seems that all i knew if i ever stop to feel i want more
i kept a steady run so my eyes could never focus anywhere
now i'm standing still and i wonder how long have you been there
how long have you been standing there protecting me from love that shouldn't be
knowing all alone that i would realize that you were meant for me
now i've got to mend every broken fence and bridge that i have burned
and clear away the cobwebs in my heart so i can start to learn
for now i realize that you've been waiting just to teach me how to care
now i'm standing still and i wonder how long have you been there
now i'm standing still and i wonder how long have you been there"
"like a raging flood that ruins a poor man's land
you keep doing things to hurt me all you can
but the thickness that we knew is growing thin how much rain can one man stand
how much rain can one man stand i gave you everything but my right hand
if you won't let me love you then don't let me be your friend
how much rain can one man stand
i can see them big ol' storm clouds movin' in
there's a stranger in your big brown eyes again
and you've told him that i'm just an old time friend how much rain can one man stand
how much rain can one man stand...
how much rain can one man stand"
"they said in her younger days her beauty was enough to drive men wild
but the hunger in her body then was not the hunger of some lonely child
like a butterfly in springtime searching every field for loving's sweetest rose
the embrace of many strangers still could not release her from the hold
in the backstreets and the bedrooms all she's found is disappointments bitterly
while the love that she's too often found was enough to satisfy her needs
she's older than the years she holds and ageing fast with each day passing by
on a downhill run to nowhere cause the hunger never can be satisfied
the reflection in her mirror's not the image she remembers in her mind
her beauty has been eaten by the hunger and the acid winds of time
she has danced the tune her demons played and payed the piper dearly for his song
empty now of all her pride but still inside her hunger's just as strong
they said in her younger days..."

i do believe in a higher power
one that loves us one and all

and to know what's right or wrong
he is that inner spirit

i'm all alone and need someone i guess that it shows
but the things you make me want to do i'll regret i know
so don't say things that you don't mean cause i just might believe
don't you be so nice to me i fall in love so easily
i'm gonna leave tonight with you go on and have your fun
i don't want to be a part of what i might have done
i'm tempted when i think about the things that might have been

cause you been so nice to me and i fall in love so easily

i got you and you got me and baby that's all we will ever need
looking through the window of a fancy diamond store
going window shopping for the things we can't afford
people all around us with their noses in the air
they walk right on by us just like we're not even there

i got you and you got me...
i got you and you got me and baby that's all we will ever need"

there's no way but yours where you're concerned
i tried till finally i lost my own identity and somewhere along the way i lost me
somewhere along the way i lost the man i used to be
a man who smiled enjoyed life loved you with all of me
you'd never once considered how i felt so go ahead and live my life yourself
i've tried so hard to be what you wanted me to be

little girl you'd better go before i'd change my mind
little girl walk away while you still have the time
it's just a part of growin' up someday you'll see
then you'll wonder what you ever saw in me
don't you know i may never pass this way again
mama sets home awaitin' you to call by now daddy's lookin' tired
wonder what can she be and what she's doin' out now late at night
little girl you better go before i lose all sense and my control
i'll be crossed bridge down on the road and you'll be left behind to pay the toll
i may never pass this way again
little girl wait for him he'll soon be on his way
little girl you think within what i'd do today

"silver coins that jingle jangle fancy shoes that dance in time
oh the secrets of her dark eyes they did sing a gypsy rhyme
yellow clover in tangled blossoms in a meadow silky green
where she held me to her bosom, lord, just a boy of seventeen
i recall a gypsy woman silver spangles in her eyes
ivory skin against the moonlight and the taste of life's sweet wine
soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows stir the darkness in my mind
oh gentle woman you sleep beside me and little know who haunts my mind
gypsy lady i hear your laughter and it dances in my head
while my tender wife and babies slumber softly in their bed
i recall a gypsy woman..."

think i'm gonna kill myself, think i'm gonna myself.
apart we've grown, now i can't go on alone.

now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.
send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.
send the rest to my hole in the ground.
i bow my head, cause in the mornin' i'm a gonna be dead.

have i done all that i can do to show my love for you

"if heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game
i'd be a legend a living legend in my time
if they gave gold statues for tears and regrets
i'd be a legend a living legend in my time
but they don't give awards and there's no praise or fame
for a heart that's been broken over love that's in vain
if loneliness meant world acclaim everyone would know my name

if you’re goin’ girl in the winter time
then you’d better take all the sparkling snow
and you’d better take the fresh cut firewood
and the smooth red wine that kept us warm
‘cause if i ever walk in the sun again
it’d be too much for me to understand
and if i ever drink warm red wine again
i’d find myself reaching for your hand

"i've learned to turn the other cheek is not what love's about
i've turned mine so many times that i damned near wore 'em out
i've grown used to your abuse and i thought i'd never quit
but i woke up this morning couldn't find my shiv a git
you've always liked to play your games well i got one for you
pretend we're playing checkers girl and it's your time to move
you'll find your suitcase on the porch and the taxi in the drive
so get your tongue out of my mouth i'm kissing you goodbye
i see you've finally made it home you been out all night
your artificial hair's a mess and your clothes don't fit you right
i've given and forgiven till there ain't nothing left
but all you gave was just enough to satisfy yourself
i can smell that whisky in your hair and sen sen on your breath
if you ever tried to tell the truth you'd choke yourself to death
i don't want your nasty kisses and don't tell me no more lies
get your tongue out of my mouth i'm kissing you goodbye
get your tongue out of my mouth i'm kissing you goodbye"

"this is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
the music is sad as they're singing along another piece of america's lost
he rides a feed lot and clerks in a market
on weekends selling tobacco and beer
his days're spent surrounded by fences
but he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here
the old chisholm trail is covered by concrete
they truck 'em to market in fifty foot rigs
they blow by his market never slowing to reason
like living and dying was all he did
this is the last cowboy song...
this is the last cowboy song...
this is the last cowboy song"
"why do you treat me as if i were only a friend
what have i done that has made you so distant and cold
sometimes i wonder if you'll be contented again
will you be happy when you are withered and old
i can't offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
and i can't offer you clothes your young body crave
but if you'd love me and say that you'll always be mine
think of the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll save honey
when you are weary and tired of another man's gold
if you ever get lonesome remember this letter my own
but don't try to answer though i've suffered sorrow untold
if you don't love me i wish you would leave me alone"

"i want to be free from the noise of the grind
so i live on the outskirts of the back of my mind
with a strong hand a songman and god on my side
i'm writing that freedom a line at a time
on the highway to nowhere that runs through my mind
a yellow line stretches out into the night
broken in places it's my guiding light
so i'm writing that freedom a line at a time
i'm walking a fine line between wrong and right
i can live with the problems of this day and time
consider me lucky cause i'll be all right
in my mind i'm having a beautiful life
i'm lost in the feelings of this heart of mine
in search of the border of infinite time
and i find peace of mind in the songs and their rhymes
so i'm writing my freedom a line at a time"

from monday morning till friday night oh those lonely weekends
since you left me i'm as lonely as i can be oh those lonely weekends

i'll make it alright from monday morning till friday night oh those lonely weekends

thought she was the queen of the basin street queens
she got tired of that smoky wine dream she began to feel lonesome on'ry and mean
we got together and we cashed in our sweeps
gave onto beggar who was mumblin' through the streets
there's no escaping from his snowy white dream

i'm down in this valley where the wheels turn so low
at dawn i pray to the lord of my soul
i say do lord do right by me you know i'm tired of being lonesome on'ry and mean"

"i don't look the way the average cowboy singer looks
i'll admit i've taken things i never should of took
you can read a different story in a lot of different books
but even then you won't really know how it was a long time ago
women have been my trouble since i found out they weren't men
in spite of that i stopped and took a wife now and then
they built their fences high but they couldn't hold me in
i was born with a fire down below and i learned to fly a long time ago
don't ask me about the years i spent out in the rain
about the ones i spent in love or the ones i spent insane
don't ask me who i gave my seat to on that plane
i think you already know i told you that a long time ago
me and ol' willie lordy we've been sold and bought
i guess you all heard about some kind of system that we fought
we ain't the only outlaws just the only ones they caught
they tried to run us off but willie's slow i quit running a long time ago"
"look into my teardrops and darling you will see
the reflection of an angel that made a fool of me
look into my teardrops and you will see the eyes
that promised me so many things but all of them were lies
look into my teardrops the mirror of my soul
and you will see the girl who stilled my only world but i couldn't hold
look into my teardrops and you will see the one
that broke my heart forever aren't you proud of what you've done
look into my teardrops..."
"i'm lookin' for a feeling that i once had with you
lookin' for a feeling i have grown accustomed to
i've had love and i've had lovers but they never seem to do
i keep lookin' for a feeling that i lost when i lost you
i said when it was over i'd be over you in time
because nothing lasts forever it's all a state of mind
i found one love i'll find another heaven knows how hard i've tried
but there's something always missing something never satisfied
i keep lookin' for a feeling..."
"i'm just a stranger in this town i'm just a drifter looking round
i might stay a lifetime or a week it all depends if i'll find what i seek
you're looking at a heart that needs a home and a little girl to love me and me alone
one who wants a gentleman and accepts me like i am
you're looking at a heart that needs a home
i thought i had found her many times but love preserves the right to change its mind
i guess perhaps my ways are strange but without this cast i can't change
you're looking at a heart...
you're looking at a heart that needs a home"

"i have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as i lay dying
healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
wiping out the traces of the people and the places that i've been
teaching me that yesterday was something that i never thought of trying
talking of tomorrow and the money love and time we have to spend
loving her was easier than anything i'll ever do again
coming close together with a feeling that i've never known before in my time
she ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
i don't know the answers to the easy way she's opened every door to my mind
but dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
loving her was easier than anything i'll ever do again mhmm"

"one two three four
in a barroom in toledo across from the depot on a barstool she took off her ring
i thought i'd get closer so i walked on over i sat down and asked her her name
when the drinks fin'lly hit her she said i'm no quitter
but i finally quit livin' on dreams
hungry for laughter and here ever after i'm after whatever the other life brings
in the mirror i saw him i closely watched him i saw the look in his eyes
he came to the woman who sat there beside me and slowly started to cry
his big hands were calloused he looked like a mountain
for a minute i thought i was dead
but he started shaking his big heart was breaking as he turned to the woman and said
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
with a four hungry children and a crop in the field
i've had some sad times lived through some bad times
but this time your hurtin' won't heal
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
after he left us i ordered more whiskey she said let's go have a ball
from the lights of the barroom to a rented hotel room we walked without talkin' at all

she must've thought that i'd lost my mind
i couldn't hold her cause the words that he told her came back to me time after time

there will be another dream for me someone will bring it
i will taste the wine while it is warm and never let you catch me looking in the sun

i will take my life into my hands and i will use it
i will win the worship in their eyes and i will lose it

when you start to feel at home out on the highway
you're damn sure qualified to sing the blues
always send a big guy for the money
don't give 'em no excuse to do you wrong
even when you lose you're still the winner
at least you've got the making's of a song
don't compromise your feelings when they matter
they'll come back to haunt you don't you know

for saturday's date and i restlessly counted the hours
then today in the mail i recieved a short little note

mary ann regrets she's unable to see you again
we'll leaving for europe next week she'll be busy till then
they know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
goodbye true love goodbye my sweet mary ann
the weeks have gone by not a word have i heard since then
i read in the papers of far away places she's been
i can't eat i can't sleep for over and over again
my mind reads that letter and i cry for my mary ann
mary ann regrets...
my mary had died too sad she just wasted away
if i could have seen her i know she'd be living today
for we loved each other and if they'd have left us alone
today she'd be wearing my ring not a blanket of stone
mary ann regrets...

"lord it's been rough and rocky travelin' but i'm finally standing upright on the ground
after taking several readings i'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound
i thought nashville was the roughest but i guess i've said the same about them all
upon hell of an education in the cities of this nation me and tompaul
i got busted in laredo for reasons that i'd rather not disclose
if you're stayin' in a motel there and leave there don't leave nothin' in your clothes
at the airport in milwaukee they refused to let us board the plane at all
they said we looked suspicious but i think they like to pick on me and paul
on a package show in buffalo with us and kitty wells and charlie pride
the show was long and i just hung around
and i'd come there to pick not for the ride
we drunk a lot of whiskey so i ain't sure we went on that night at all
i don't think they even missed us i guess buffalo ain't geared for me and tompaul"

"the reflections of the trees are cut by the bow of my pirogue
and spattered by the paddle of my eager hand
that mississippi woman is a wavin' over yonder
wavin' her lantern for her louisiana man
how i love that mississippi woman how i love that mississippi girl
how i love that mississippi woman but her heart does not belong to me
the lantern light and moonbeams are dancing patterns on the water
she doesn't seem to realize i've learned her secret plans
my jealous mind is thinking as i paddle through the sleeping alligators
she don't know i know about her louisiana man
how i love that mississippi woman...
the reflections of the trees are cut by the bow of my pirogue
and splattered by the paddle of my shaky hand
the silence from behind me is alive with the splashing alligators
and the lantern light is blinking on the bottom in the sand
how i love that mississippi woman...
how i love that mississippi woman..."
"i can give you golden tinkling bells to even dangle through your long black hair
i can give you magic satin slippers woven just to take you anywhere
i can give you all the love and tenderness a broken heart can spare
but mona take the love i give don't ask for love i gave away back there
you could take the hand of any man and show him how to dream
why do you look back into my dark and bitter past can't you see
mona when you found me all i had was sad and broken dreams
mona please be satisfied walking through tomorrow here with me
i can give you golden tinkling bells to even dangle through your long black hair
i can give you magic satin slippers woven just to take you anywhere"
"so long i've been trying to give you the things that you've wanted
but your thirst for riches is more than my pockets can stand
and i know that you're dreaming of things you could have with another
cause to your way of thinking the money is what makes the man
you like to be seen in the richest and finest of places
you're always emarrassed by the callouses here on my hands
and i know that it's only a matter of time till you leave me
cause to your way of thinking the money is what makes the man
you may find a rich man to give you the things that you long for
but if you're still lonely then darling you may understand
that with all of his gold he can't give you the love that i gave you
for a man can make money but money cannot make the man
you may find a rich man...
a man can make money but money cannot make the man"

even against all the odds i've rolled the dice
count me in on any deal that comes around
right or wrong never slowed me down
i've always loved you silent but strong
deep down in your heart you've always known
it's just that i've made more mistakes than any man under the sun
you're the only sensible thing i've ever done
never complaining back when the times were bad
even when your faith in me was all we had
loving me wasn't worth the price you paid
darling i've been wrong this is all i can say
i've always loved you silent but strong...
you're the only sensible thing i've ever done"
"tell us once again this morning old friend how did you win the war
everybody loves a hero it don't matter if they've heard the tale before
and tell us of the time when almost everybody knew you were a star
and how intelligent you are
prove that you're alive mr shuck and jive
you can tell us of the man who stole your fortune and nearly ruined your life
or better still the one about the tv and the couch and your best friend's wife
tell us of grand projects never finished with somebody else to blame
and all the reasons that your fame
just never did arrive mr shuck and jive
if you can get yourself together kindly write a criticism of this song
how it's exquisitely constructed and yet mechanical and somehow slightly wrong
and you can put it in your book about the enemy you never even met
you know you just might make it yet
but somehow you'll survive mr shuck and jive"
"what is it that brings you to this part of town curiosity conscience or fate
i know it's not love for i once gave you love and all you gave me was the gate
i got a feeling you've come back to just rub it in and it really put me in my place
you've already put big old tears in my eyes why must you throw dirt in my face
must you keep telling me you've got a new love i don't need you to remind me
must you keep telling me i look so lonesome and that my better days are behind me
must you keep showing me pictures of him and boasting of his warm embrace
you've already put big old tears in my eyes must you throw dirt in my face
you've already left me and broken my heart told me how much you don't want me
believe i'm happier when we're apart why must you come back now and haunt me
must you keep showing me pictures...
you've already put big old tears in my eyes must you throw dirt in my face"

they say she's changed a lot since i've been gone
they say she may not be too glad to see me
cause ramona doesn't know i'm coming home
but everybody's wrong about ramona
they're just going by the way she's actin' now
i just can't believe the things they say about her
cause ramona knows the things i wanna allow
ramana's gonna be the way she used to be
and i'll be proud of her just like i was before
she never was the kind to like those crowded bars
and ramona won't be seen there anymore
they say i may not recognize ramona and going by the picture they describe
the life they say she's living sure don't fit her
but i know she's still the same sweet girl inside
ramona's gonna be the way..."

for too long i've had nothing new to show you
goodbye dry eyes i watched your plane fade off west of the moon
it felt so strange to walk away alone
no regrets no tears goodbye don't want you back we'd only cry again
say goodbye again
the hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
the toughts we used to share i now keep alone
i awoke last night and spoke to you not thinking you were gone
and it felt so strange to lie awake alone
no regrets no tears goodbye...
our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
strange faces in your place can't keep the ghosts away
just beyond the darkest hour just behind the dawn
it feels so strange to leave my life alone
no regrets no tears goodbye..."

so i bent my back till i think it's gonna break
try to keep a thinkin' how much i'm gonna make
pickin' white gold pickin' white gold
there's a little girl i call bellie all day she works alongside of me
pickin' white gold pickin' white gold
her lips are soft as a cotton in a hand and side by side we're makin' our plans
pickin' white gold pickin' white gold
there's a little house with a little solid ground that would make a mighty pretty home
all we lead is little money down and we could call it our rome
i can't rest till i get through i need the money for what it can do
pickin' white gold pickin' white gold pickin' white gold pickin' white gold"
"as i wander on life's pathway know not what the future holds

precious mem'ries how they linger how they ever flood my soul
in the stillness of the midnight precious sacred scenes unfold

precious mem'ries how they linger..."

"somewhere in vietnam a 19 year old soldier walked out of a barroom
and he said i must be seeing things that bourbon hit me like a baseball bat
in bellfast ireland a little lady dropped her shovel in her garden
she raced across the yard and ask her neighbor mrs clancy what was that
in memphis tennessee a teacher raised the window closest the river
and the children in her classroom swore they'd heard a choir singing down the street
in washington dc a private secretary's lips began to quiver
and the president just put aside his papers and rose quickly to his feet
i lay in a cheap motel in the arms of someone else's woman
when a loud explosion rocked the room and turned the morning into night
i jumped out of bed and ran into the street with hardly any clothes on
as the sky lit up my heart stood still and i could feel my face was turnin' white
all at once the clouds rolled back and there stood jesus christ in all his glory
and i realized the saddest eyes i'd ever seen were lookin' straight at me
i guess i was awakened by the penetrating sounds of my own screamin'
and it didn't take me long to stumble out of bed and fall down on my knees
as tears rolled down my face i cried dear god i'm thankful i was only dreamin'
and if i never go to hell lord it'll be because you scared it out of me"

just because i love you so i overlook your lies
let you make a fool of me yes that's what i'll always be

love is blind and i can't see what's right before my eyes
i can't make myself believe what's right before my eyes
i thought your love belong to me but now i realize
you couldn't care and act this way there's nothing i can do or say

"almost out of adolescence and into a world we didn't know
not necessaryly love but in trouble with a fire down below
looking back for a feeling it's just something far away and long ago
i can still recall the name but she's really someone i don't even know
but she was right for the time
she was right for the time but time has a way of moving on
i do recall a gypsy lady and a younger man in over his head
i was her believer taken in by every loving word she said
it was there for the first time the sweet and the bitter taste of love
when you're young and alive too much never seems to be enough
it seems the young and the innocent are drawn like a moth to a flame
to the wild and the reckless believing they are one in the same
she never found a way to separate the good from the bad
and she never understood that love was all we ever really had
she was right for the time but time has a way of moving on
with her eyes on tomorrow one day she turned around and i was gone
i'd have to say in a way she just might be better off alone
she was right for the time but time has a way of moving on"

now you've gone betrayed my trust rings of gold have turned to rust

love before was clean and pure never more can i be sure
you will not betray mu trust rings of gold have turned to rust
plans we made just yesterday sands of time have chipped away
now they've crumbled into dust rings of gold have turned to rust
rings of gold have turned to rust"

when you're nothin' but a river boy
i do a lot of fishin' on the river
to make my livin' you see
when i take my catch to the market place
the people call out to me
and they say, river boy, hey river boy
you got any fish today there, river boy
i sell my ware, but nobody cares
about the feelin's of the river boy
there's a pretty girl works at the market place
i see her there everyday
but when i try to talk to her
i can hear her papa say
come away from that river boy, he's a river boy
nothin' but riff raff, them river boys
no girl of mine is gonna waste her time
on a good for nothin' river boy
so i head my boat back up the river
back to my old fishin' place

"disappointments weigh so heavy leave its wreckage all around
once a good man once respected sorrow breaks a good man down
had a good love had a good life now the sadness all around
dread the darkness hate the daylight sorrow breaks a good man down
i remember all the good times when the world was ours to flame
then she left me took the sunshine every night wind speaks her name
can't stop loving can't stop living there's no answer to be found
no ambition just existing sorrow breaks a good man down
i remember all the good times...
sorrow breaks a good man down"
"there's a ramshackle shack in old caroline it's callin' me back to the woman of mine
guess if i had the wings of a beautiful dove
don't you know i'd fly away to the woman i love
when the whippoorwills called on the hills far away
we're gonna sing a little song we're gonna hear them say
my love for you will never ever die we bid everything sail away to the by sweet and by
those two brown eyes that sparkle with love came down to me from heaven above
guess if i had the wings of a beautiful dove
don't you know i'd fly away to the woman i love
there's a ramshackle shack..."
"new york woman tryin' to make me love her a sad eyed girl with rollers in her hair
down the hall somebody's cooking cabbage kids're running up and down the stairs
i'd like to leave this god forsaken city but i can't go no matter how i try
but once again i'll be in oklahoma tonight when i lay down and close my eyes
i'll be standing in that oklahoma sunshine just got off a bus from another world
kissing mom and shaking hands with papa dryin' the teras of an oklahoma girl
standing in that oklahoma sunshine a dream that i have dreamed so many times
the blue eyed girl with the golden hair still loves me
when i go back to oklahoma in my mind
when the cold wind blows in this big city a part of me flies home to where it's warm
new york woman thinks that i'm still with her just because i'm sleeping in her arms
but i'll be standing...
oh i'll be standing in that oklahoma sunshine just got off a bus from another world"
"can't go home if you're goin' by the mill
cause the bridge's washed out at the bottom of the hill
big creek's up and little creek's level plow my corn with a double shovel
stay all night stay a little longer dance all night dance a little longer
pull off your coat throw it in the corner don't see why you can't stay a little longer
sittin' in the window singin' to my love slop bucket fell from the window up above
mule and the grasshopper eatin' ice cream
mule got sick so they laid him on the green
stay all night...
well you ought to see my blue eyed sally she lives away down on shinbone alley
the number on the gate the number on the door
the next house over is the grocery store
stay all night...
stay all night...
don't see why you can't stay a little longer"
"stop the world and let me off i'm tired of going round and round

stop the world and let me off...
stop the world and let me off..."

"a tiger always walks at night and marks his prey while everything's still
he waits until it's unaware and then he strikes and makes his kill
that's the way you've done me girl you never let me brieve
couldn't feel the way i felt so you'd tried to punish me
baby it's time to straighten my mind
a spider's always busy spinning webs that no one can get through
somehow that spider always has reminded me babe of you
you took the love i gave you but you'll never let it live
that's the hang of girl you know how to take but not to give
baby it's time to straighten my mind
you've kept me like a river always clinging to the ground
i've got to get away from you before i sink and drown
baby it's time to straighten my mind"
"oh such a waste of love true love and devotion
oh such a waste of love on a heart so cold with no emotion
i might as well just wrap it up and wash it down the drain
cause the little happiness i knew just wasn't worth the pain
you build me up and for a little while you let me live
but love is the only thing i find you never learned to give
oh such a waste of love...
oh such a waste of love..."
"i left the old farm down in texas and bummed all around for a time
then one day i found myself staring at a sign that read sunset and wine
the big cars and the beautiful women put beautiful thoughts in my mind
i decided to be a great actor on the corner of sunset and wine
then a man with a cigar approached me and he put his face right to mine
and declared a great star hit this cover on the corner of sunset and wine
well i thought he was right for a while for the band seemed to thrill with each line
and they put my name in the sidewalk near the corner of sunset and wine
now six wives and six divorces later i'm down to one very thin dime
and i wish i was back home in texas and i'd never seen sunset and wine
i wish i'd never seen sunset and wine"

it sure didn't take him long changing her mind
sure didn't take her long to leave me behind
she had breakfast with me met him at three by suppertime she was gone
to take my ann took a hell of a man but it sure didn't take him too long
now ann never was a righteous girl but you really couldn't call her bad
i'd have to say as long as she stayed lord she gave it all that she had
one look at them two looks at him i knew i'd be a living alone

first was the spring and spring became the summer who'd believe you'd come along
hands touching hands reaching out touching me touching you

i'm inclined to believe they never would
look at the night doesn't seem so lonely fill it up with only two

warm touching warm reaching out touching me touching you
oh sweet caroline...

cause i won't be there to hold your hand like i used to
i'm through with you
you're a hell of a singer and powerful man
but you surround yourself with people who demand so little of you
you touched my soul with your beautiful song
even had me singin' along right with you you said i need you
then you changed the words and added harmony
sang the song you had written for me to someone new
nobody sings love songs quite like you do nobody else can make me sing along
nobody else can make me feel the things are right when i know they're wrong
nobody sings love songs quite like you
sing your song sweet music man
travel the world with a six piece band that does for you
what you ask me to
and you try to stay young but the songs are sung
to so many people who've all begun came back on you
sing your song sad music man makin' your living doing one night stands
they're through with you they don't need you
you're still a hell of a singer but a broken man
but you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to
nobody sings a love song quite like you do nobody else can make me sing along
nobody else can make me feel the things are right
when they're wrong with a song
nobody sings a love song quite like you
she said sing your song sweet music man i believe in you"

if the blue coats wearin' soldiers crossed the river that night
sure as hell that sundown came a hundred thousand men
and it's sure did shock me lord, kin killing kin
the cannonballs were heavy filled
with iron and steel and lead
and the james river water ran a bloody red
lord is it right?
did you mean for me to kill my brother here tonight?
it's been one hundred years and as i look around

out on the road that lies before me now there are some turns where i will spin
i only hope that you can hold me now till i can gain control again

woke up a freezin' with rain pourin' down so hard i can open my eyes
i been chased from the yard with dogs at my heels searchin' for shelter at times
but there's nothing so hard for a man on the bum as the time between bottles of wine
the time between bottles of wine
beggin' for pennies just one sweet taste of the nectar that kills the man's soul
sweet piece of mind excuses my pride just somethin' that keep out the cold
it's too late for me to start living again the good life is too far behind
i never remembere the things that i've had till the time between bottles of wine
the time between bottles of wine
if mama could see me she wouldn't believe i even resemble her son
she would throw her life to make me a man and she's proud the child that she's done
what one love created another destroy the story is older than time
the tale of a man who just can't stand the time between bottles of wine
the time between bottles of wine the time between bottles of wine
the time between bottles of wine"

"it was winter time in nashville down on music city row
i was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
to warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
and keep the chilly winds off my guitar
my thirsty wanted whiskey and my hunger needed beans
but i guess it'd been a month of payday since i heard that eagle scream
so with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
i left my pride and stepped inside a bar
actually i guess you'd call it a tavern
cigarette smoke to the ceiling sawdust on the floor friendly shadows
i saw that there was just an old man sittin' at the bar
in the mirror i could see him checkin' me and my guitar
he said come up here boy show us what you are i said i'm dry he bought me a beer
he nodded at my guitar said it's a tough life ain't it i just looked at him
and he said you ain't makin' any money are you i said you been readin' my mail
he just smiled and said let me see that guitar
i got somethin' you oughta hear then he laid it on me
if you waste your time a talkin' to the people who don't listen
to the things that you are sayin' who do you thinks gonna hear
and if you should die explainin' how the thing they complain about
or the things they could be changing who do you thinks gonna care
there were lots of other singers in the world turned deaf and blind
who were crucified for what they tried to show
now their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
and the truth remains that no one wants to know
well the old man was a stranger but i'd've heard his song before
back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
and lonesome was more than a state of mind
you see the devil haunts a hungry man
and if you don't wanna join him well he's gotta figure out someway to beat him
and i ain't sayin' i beat the devil but i drink his beer for nothin'
and then i stole his song
you can still hear me singin' to the people who don't listen
to the things that i am sayin' prayin' someone's gonna hear
and i guess i'll die explaining how the things that they complain about
are things they could be changin' hopin' someone's gonna care
i was born to be a singer and i'm bound to die the same
but i've got to feed this hunger in my soul
if i never have a nickel i won't even die in shame
cause i don't believe that no one wants to know"
"today i started loving you again i'm right back where i've really always been
i got over you just long enough to let my heartaches mend
and today i started loving you again
what a fool i was to think i could get by with only these few million tears i cried
i should have known the worst was yet to come
and that crying time for me had just begun
oh today i started loving you again...
i got over you just long enough..."

"i can tell that somewhere there's someone you loved more than me
someone you loved more than me
and it hurts to say it but you have the right to be free
i know that's the way it should be
but i'm too far gone too far gone
i've loved you so much for so long i'm too far gone
if ever your new love should hurt you or make you feel blue
hurt you or make you feel blue
remember your old love will still be around loving you i'll be around loving you
cause i'm too far gone..."
"verse 1:

i was so ugly the doctor slapped my momma when i was born
then he took out his pocket knife and cut off my horns
he said lady if you ain't already picked out a name
go ahead on and call him trouble man

he's gonna be wild,i'm giving you warning

he's gotta have room,keep an eye on him

out of control,trouble man

"he's a sad song singer he plays a gut stringer
with vagabond fingers that follow his mind
to far away places he reaches for traces
and touches the faces he's long left behind
he'll keep you from knowing where he's been or going
you'll see the distance right there in his eyes
just short of stealing he'll take your feelings
pull at your heart strings till they come untied
once was a woman who made him turn lonesome
her memory turns over and over again
like an old stallion who's longing for freedom
trying to outrun the wind
well i've laughed with the sunshine cried with the rains
i've had some bad nights with the best of the blues
and i go on pretending with long haired women
i still get crazy when i think of you
once was a woman who made him turn lonesome...
he's like an old stallion who's longing for freedom

"you load the horses i'll pack the rigger
let's tell 'em goodbye and walk out the door
one drink and one kiss can lead to too many
we ought to know cause we been there before
eight hours of ridin' will put us in houston
two hours of sleep to make it or bust
eight seconds of glory you stay in the money
and five year old whiskey to wash down the dust
that ain't no hill for a couple of climbers
that's all we ever intended to be
that ain't no hill for a couple of climbers
two old sidewinders like you and me
let's find us a place and a couple of ladies
someone to lie to someone to trust
someone who's impressed by a couple of outlaws
who's gold plated trophies have turned into rust
now we're damned near broke and we keep buyin' whiskey
do you think they might settle for a bottle of wine
well those two over there right there by the jukebox
yours don't look back hoss but just look at mine
that ain't no hill for a couple of climbers..."
"two streaks of steel stretchin' cross the land too far to reach for my baby's hand
i stood and watched her disappear and in the distance i could hear whooe
tomorrow i'll see coming down the track
that same old train that she ain't coming back
for her sweet love that once was mine faded just like a whistle's whine whooe
two streaks of steel i've been standing beside
where all that mattered in my life just died
i want to lay across those tracks when that train
crossed those two streaks steel once again
two streaks of steel took my love away no reason now for me to wanna stay
next time i'll hear that whistle moan that all my troubles will be gone whooe whooe"
"i swore the last time that you let me down that i wouldn't see you if you came around
i can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
and i've been so lonely since you've been gone
you've got me under your spell again saying those things again
making me believe that you're just mine
dreaming those dreams again scheming those schemes again
i've gotta take you back just one more time
everybody tells me that i'm a fool that i never should have put my faith in you
way down deep inside i guess i know it's true
no one else can make me feel the way you do
you've got me under your spell again...
i've gotta take you back just one more time
i've gotta take you back just one more time
i've gotta take you back just one more time"
"my woman goes about her way hangin' on from day to day god knows she's tried
to do her best for her and me knowin' that she'll always be unsatisfied
she tells me everything's alright but when she should be sleepin' nights
i've heard her cry
but she greeds me like the morning sun makes me wish i was the one unsatisfied
but soon the warmer wind will blow her way i know
and warm her like she never has been warmed before
lord she deserves the very best with me she'll never be addressed we'd tried and tried
but a man can tell when somethin's wrong woman can go just so long unsatisfied
soon the warmer wind will blow her way i know
and warm her like she never has been warmed before
she deserves the very best with me she'll never be addressed god knows i've tried
but i can't be what i can't be she can't live a life with me unsatisfied unsatisfied
unsatisfied unsatisfied"

"about fourteen miles out of abilene
at a curve in the road and a little stream
i found out what love's about
so long ago wonder what i found out
we all got together at the buffalo gap
granpa gus ain't got no lap
he went to heaven in a rocking chair
what a surprise if he ain't the only one there
you've got a man over eight feet tall
he can sleep in the kitchen with his feet in the hall
you ain't much more than five feet two
i bet you can do anything you've a mind to
this little song means nothing to you
wouldn't matter at all if you wanted it to
just part of my life and part of the show
ain't that good but i thought you might want to know"
"i hear the echo of your footsteps they're right in step with marching time
since you've walked out of my life and out of my world please walk on out of my mind
i know you're hidin' there in the darkness and it's got me running scared and blind
since you've walked out of my life out of my world please walk on out of my mind
you've got footprints all over my mem'ries i must erase them if i can
you keep stumbling through my hopes and dreams kickin' around my future plans
you've got me walking round in circles looking for something i'll never find
since you've walked out of my life and out of my world please walk on out of my mind"

it's a fairyland tale that's come true
when you look at me girl with those stars in your eyes
i could waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas with you in my arms
waltz across texas with you
like a storybook ending i'm lost in your charms
and i could waltz across texas with you
my heartaches and troubles are just up and gone
the moment you come into view
with your hand in mine dear i could dance on and on
and waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas with you in my arms..."

how many love songs
and how many dance floors
have lovers like us waltzed across

so waltz me to heaven tonight
to the waltz of the angels we'll blissfully blind
on past the milkyway to paradise

waltz me to heaven tonight
honky tonk angels in heavenly flight
with the moon as our halo and the stars in our eyes
won't you waltz me to heaven to   night.

waltz me to heaven tonight
hold your heavenly body against mine so tight
as the band softly plays on this magical night
we'll dance past the milkyway to paradise

won't you waltz me to heaven tonight"

just wave goodbye to me and i'll be gone gone gone gone
wave goodbye to me and i'll be gone

that might not be so easy to explain

"honey how you've changed it makes me wonder have i ever really known you
how could you abuse and use the kindeness and tenderness that i have shown you
if i have known then i have shown the strenght on which my love could make a stand
but you've mistaken tenderness and kindness for the weakness in your man
i can give you almost anything if i know what you're looking for
i can give you everything any other man can give and more
he may promise you the world but i can give you everything he can
so don't mistake my tenderness for any sign of weakness in your man
i may live my life alone with walls of stone inside some lonely cell
but no man's gonna take the love i own and never live to tell the tale
so don't forsake the vows you made and don't remove my little golden band
and don't mistake my tenderness for any sign of weakness in your man
don't mistake my tenderness for any sign of weakness in your man"
"i could lay aside my better judgement
i could turn my back on all the pain
make believe you mean it when you touch me
and be fool enough to think you'd change
i'm no fool and you're not changing
you know i'm telling the heartbreaking truth
you've gone wild and i'm going crazy
and what bothers me most is i don't bother you
late at night you're such a great temptation
i'm too weak to fight you everytime
lying in my bed of desperation
i want you lying in these arms of mine
i'm no fool and you're not changing...
oh what bothers me most is i don't bother you"
"what makes me wanna roam when i got so much love at home
what makes a man wander what makes a man wander
the whistle of a train does something to my brain
what makes a man wander what makes a man wander
i know i love you as much as i ever could love anyone yet i'm still gone
i come back and i vow to settle down now then i'm gone with the dawn
what makes me wanna roam when i got so much love at home
what makes a man wander what makes a man wander
i know i love you as much...
oh what makes a man wander what makes a man wander"

but don't you ever dream about a life where corn don't grow
he just sat there silent staring in his favorite coffee cup
i saw a storm of mixed emotion in his eyes when he looked up
he said son i know at your age it feels like this old world is turning slow
and you think you'll find the answer to it all where corn don't grow
but hard times are real there's dusty fields no matter where you go
you may change your mind cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow
i remember feeling guilty when daddy turned and walked back in the house
i was only seventeen back then but it seems like i knew more than i do now
i can't say he didn't tell me this city life's a hard row to hoe

love has gone there's nothing left i wanna leave i can't help myself
i don't want to live haven't another try in some old house where love has died

i've got buses and trucks and stuffs that all make loud noises
why i even own things that i ain't never seen
and it fills me with pride when i hear them say
there goes a good ol' boy who made it through
i count my blessings with each of your kisses
when you add it all up where would i be without you
you helped me along like an angel of mercy my nature is such that i could've strayed

where others would leave you always have stayed

"willie and laura mae jones were our neighbours a long time back

we worked the fields together learned to count on each other
when you live off the land you ain't got time to think of another man's color
the cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
that was another place and another time
sit out on the front porch every evening when the sun went down
willie would play and laura would sing and them younguns'd dance around
i'd bring out my guitar and we'd play on through the night
every now and then ol' willie would grin and say boy you play all right
the cotton was high...
the years rolled past our land and took back what they'd given
we all knew we'd had to move if we were gonna make a livin'
so we all moved off and went about our separate ways
it sure was hard to say goodbye to willie and laura mae
the cotton was high...
the years rolled past our doors and we heard of them no more
when i saw willie downtown the other day

well i don't give a damn when i choose to no it don't hurt so bad when you're high
oh say does the future of the homesick and the brave even matter anymore
there ain't no more reason for them boys to run away than there was to fight before
would you tell me why the hell we'd try to win back in a war
what we wasted in the last
might just ain't as righteous as it used to be before when your army's out of gas

"i remember the day that clayton delaney died
they said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
it made a big impression on me although i was a barefoot kid
they said he got religion at the end and i'm glad that he did
clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
i thought he was a hero and i used to follow clayton around
i often wondered why clayton who seemed so good to me
never took his old guitar and made it down in tennessee
well daddy said he drank a lot but i could never understand
i knew he used to picked up in ohio with a five piece band
clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
there ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early gray
i guess if i'd admit it clayton taught me how to drink booze
i can see him half stoned pickin' up the lovesick blues
when clayton died i made him a promise i was gonna carry on somehow
i'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now
i remember the year that clayton delaney died
nobody ever knew it but i went out in the woods and i cried
i know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than i do
but it could be the good lord likes a little picking too
i remember the year that clayton delaney died"

most lovely creature that i've seen

yellow woman flows across this rich satin bed
magnificed of perfect feature leaving nothing left unsaid
as i listen to her breathing suddenly i find no escape i'm weary kind

knowing how much i love you
and after all that i've been through
i'd turn and walk away from you
just because you asked me to.

seen the beauty of this land made by nature and by men
but when i leave i don't look back for i've only left my tracks
i've crossed the burning bridges and walked through miles of sand
seen the lawlest in the law you beat all i ever saw
i've dreamed a million miles about your eyes and smiles
i know i've loved the best i can't be content with last
i've scanned the skies of blue for just one glimpse of you
but they threw away the mold of a love that's grown so cold
your heart would never thought you beat all i ever saw"

that i was broken down and out i'd reach and you'd be gone

but the ties that bind keep holding on and they're strong
you'll think of me being with her like i thought of her being with them

when the moon peeps through the pines and there's mem'ries on your mind
you're gonna wonder about me babe you're gonna wonder about me
pretty soon you may find that you miss me but by then i'll be many miles away
i may be in baltimore with old friends i knew before

how can i even try i can never win hearin' them seein' them in the state i'm in
how could she say to me love will find a way
gather round all you clowns let me hear you say
you've got to hide your love away you've got to hide your love away"

reminding me you were here
long after the glow has faded from the moonlight
and the stars have given way to greet the dawn
long after the night has faded to sunlight
your love lingers on
it's still in the air, it's everywhere
it never disappears
it's surrounding me, like a melody
reminding me you were here
long after your whisper has faded from my ears
and the curtains are no longer drawn
long after the passion fades into memories
your love lingers on
it's still in the air, it's everywhere
it never disappears
it's surrounding me, like a melody
reminding me you were here
your love lingers on
your love lingers on"
"may the fruit of my toil be yours love may the fruit from my soil be yours love
and from this moment on may a love true and strong
and lives on and on be yours love
may the sons that i raise be yours love may the comforts i praise be yours love
if i ever get weak may the love words i speak and the arms that i seek be yours love
may the lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
may the last fingertips that touch these two lips as life from me slips be yours love"
