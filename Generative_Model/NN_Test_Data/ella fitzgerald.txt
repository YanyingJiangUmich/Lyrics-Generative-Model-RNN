"look at me,
i'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
and i feel like i'm clingin' to a cloud,
i can' t understand
i get misty,
just holding your hand.
walk my way,
and a thousand violins begin to play,
or it might be the sound of your hello that music i hear,
i get misty, the moment you're near.
can't you see that you're leading me on?
and it's just what i want you to do,
don't you notice how hopelessly i'm lost
that's why i'm following you.
on my own,
when i wander through this wonderland alone,
never knowing my right foot from my left
my hat from my glove
i'm too misty, and too much in love.
too misty, and too much
in love..."
"every time i look down on this timeless town,
whether blue or gray be her skies,
whether loud be her cheers, or whether soft be her tears,
more and more do i realize that...
i love paris in the spring time
i love paris in the fall
i love paris in the summer when it sizzles
i
love paris in the winter when it drizzles
i love paris every moment
every moment of the year
i love
paris, why oh why do i love paris
because my love is here"
"why do you grieve?
try and believe
life is always sunshine
when the heart beats true
banish your fears
smile through your tears
when you're sad
it makes me feel the same as you...
come to me my melancholy baby
cuddle up and don't be blue
all your fears are foolish fancy, maybe
you know, dear, that i'm in love with you;
every cloud must have a silver lining
wait until the sun shines through
come on and smile, my honey dear,
while i kiss away each tear"

"heaven, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
heaven, i'm in heaven
and the cares that hung around me through the week
seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
when we're out together dancing  cheek to cheek
oh i love to climb a mountain
and reach the highest peak
but it doesn't thrill  me half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek
oh i love to go out fishing
in a river or a creek
but i don't enjoy it half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek
 dance with me
i want my arm about you
that  charm about you
will carry me through...
 to heaven, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together dancing, out together dancing out together dancing cheek to cheek"
"our love
is a dream, but in my reverie
i can see that this love was meant for me
only a poor fool
never schooled in the whirlpool
of romance could be so cruel
as you are to me
my dreams are as worthless as tin to me
without you life will never begin to be
so love me
as i love you in my reverie
make my dream a reality
let's dispense with formality
come to me in my reverie"
"have you seen the well to do
up and down park avenue
on that famous thoroughfare
with their noses in the air
high hats and narrow collars
white spats and lots of dollars
spending every dime
for a wonderful time
now, if you're blue
and you don't know where to go to
why don't you go where fashion sits
puttin' on the ritz
different types who wear a daycoat
pants with stripes and cutaway coat
perfect fits
puttin' on the ritz
dressed up like a million dollar trooper
trying hard to look like gary cooper
super duper
come, let's mix where rockefellers
walk with sticks or ""umberellas""
in their mitts
puttin' on the ritz
       short instrumental break       
tips his hat just like an english chappie
to a lady with a wealthy pappy
very snappy
you'll declare it's simply topping
to be there and hear them swapping
smart tidbits
puttin' on the ritz"
"summer journeys to niag'ra

in the whiles
and starve together dear, in chiles
we'll go to coney

soul to soul

verse
summer journeys to niag'ra
and to other places aggra 
vate all our cares.
we'll save our fares;
i've a cozy little flat in
what is known as old manhattan,
we'll settle down
right here in town.
chorus 1
we'll have manhattan,
the bronx and staten
island too.
it's lovely going through the zoo.
it's very fancy
on old delancey
street you know.
the subway charms us so,
when balmy breezes blow
to and fro.
and tell me what street
compares with mott street
in july?
sweet pushcarts gently gliding by.
the great big city's a wondrous toy
just made for a girl and boy   
we'll turn manhattan
into an isle of joy.
chorus 2
we'll go to greenwich,
where modern men itch
to be free,
and bowling green you'll see with me.
we'll bathe at brighton,
the fish you'll frighten
when you're in,
your bathing suit so thin
will make the shellfish grin,
fin to fin.
i'd like to take a
sail on jamaica
bay with you,
and fair canarsie's lakes we'll view.
the city's bustle cannot destroy
the dreams of a girl and boy   
we'll turn manhattan
into an isle of joy.
chorus 3
we'll go to yonkers,
where true love conquers
in the wilds
and starve together, dear, in childs'.
we'll go to coney
and eat bologny
on a roll,
in central park we'll stroll
where our first kiss we stole,
soul to soul.
and south pacific
is a terrific
show they say,
we both may see it close some day.
the city's clamour can never spoil
the dreams of a boy and goil   
we'll turn manhattan
into an isle of joy.
chorus 4
we'll have manhattan,
the bronx and staten
island too,
we'll try to cross fifth avenue.
as black as onyx
we'll find the bronix
park express,
our flatbush flat, i guess,
will be a great success,
more or less.
a short vacation
on inspiration
point we'll spend,
and in the station house we'll end.
but civic virtue cannot destroy
the dreams of a girl and boy   
we'll turn manhattan"
"i was blue, just as blue as i could be
ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
then good luck came a knocking at my door
skies were gray but they're not gray anymore
blue skies
smiling at me
nothing but blue skies
do i see
bluebirds
singing a song
nothing but bluebirds
all day long
never saw the sun shining so bright
never saw things going so right
noticing the days hurrying by
when you're in love, my how they fly
blue days
all of them gone
nothing but blue skies
from now on
i should care if the wind blows east or west
i should fret if the worst looks like the best
i should mind if they say it can't be true"
"now ella, it's you i'm adoring,
ella, your sweetness is calling
in my heart you started a song;
now in my arms is where you belong!
ella, don't keep me imploring,
let's steal away, just we two.
you need no fortune teller
for you, my cinderella,
i love you, sweet ella, i do!
now if you love me like you sing it,
then you really have to swing it!
take your trumpet down from your side
and really play your part!"
"strawberry woman
oh dey's so fresh an' fine
an' dey's jus' off de vine
strawberries, strawberries, strawberries,
oh, dey's so fresh an' fine
an' dey's just off de vine,"
"i wake up every morning with a smile on my face
everything in its place as it should be
i start out every morning just as free as the breeze
my cares upon the shelf
because i find myself with
no strings and no connections
no ties to my affections
i'm fancy free and free for anything fancy
no dates that can't be broken
no words that can't be spoken
especially when i am feeling romancy
like a robin upon a tree
like a sailor that goes to sea
like an unwritten melody
i'm free, that's me
so
bring on the big attraction
my decks are cleared for action"
"i fetch his slippers, fill up the pipe he smokes
i cook the kippers, laugh at his oldest jokes
yet here i anchor, i might have had a banker
boy! what love has done to me
his nature's funny, quarrelsome half the time
and as for money, he hasn't got a dime
and here's the joker, i might have had a broker
boy! what love has done to me
when a guy looks my way
does he get emphatic, say he gets dramatic?
i just wanna fly 'way
but if i left him i'd be all at sea
i'm just a slavey, life is a funny thing
he's got the gravy, i got a wedding ring
and still i love him, there's nobody above him
boy! what love has done to me
his brains are minus,
never a thought in sight
and yet his highness
lectures me day and night;
oh where was my sense
to sign that wedding licence?
boy! what love has done to me!
my life he's wrecking, bet you could find him now
out somewhere necking somebody else's frau
you get to know life when married to a low life
boy! what love has done to me
i can't hold my head up
the butcher, the baker, oh no he's a faker
brother i am fed up
but if i left him he'd be up a tree
where will it wind up, i don't know where i'm at
i make my mind up, i oughta leave him flat
but i have grown so, i love that dirty so and so
boy! what love has done to me."
"somewhere there's music
how faint the tune
somewhere there's heaven
how high the moon
there is no moon above
when love is far away too
till it comes true
that you love me as i love you
somewhere there's heaven
it's where you are
somewhere there's music
how near, how far
the darkest night would shine
if you would come to me soon
until you will, how still my heart
how high the moon
somewhere there's music
how faint the tune
somewhere there's heaven
how high the moon
the darkest night would shine
if you would come to me soon
until you will, how still my heart
how high the moon"
"i got a guy
chick webb & his orchestra
v_ella fitzgerald 
i got a guy
he don't dress me in sable
he looks nothing like gable
but he's mine
and i think he's too divine
i got a guy
when he starts into pet me
he's the sauce on spaghetti
he's the kind that you can't keep off you mind
i got a guy
and he's tough
he's just a gem in the rough
but when i polish him up
i swear, he'll be a tiffany solitaire
i'm riding high
'cos i'm happy and carefree
there is nothing can scare me
'cos i got a guy
i got a guy
and he's tough
he's just a gem in the rough
but when i polish him up
i swear, he'll be a tiffany solitaire
i'm riding high
'cos i'm happy and carefree
there is nothing can scare me
'cos i got a guy"
"there are many many crazy things
that will keep me loving you
and with your permission
may i list a few
the way you wear your hat
the way you sip your tea
the memory of all that
no they can't take that away from me
the way your smile just beams
the way you sing off key
the way you haunt my dreams
no they can't take that away from me
we may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
still i'll always, always keep the memory of
the way you hold your knife
the way we danced till three
the way you changed my life"
"april skies are in your eyes
but darling, don't be blue
don't cry,
oh honey please
don't be that way
clouds in the sky
should never make you feel that way
the rain
will bring the violets of may
tears are in vain so honey please don't be that way
as long as we
see it through
you'll have me
i'll have you
sweetheart
tomorrow is another day
don't break my heart
oh honey, please don't be that way
don't cry,
oh honey please
don't be that way
clouds in the sky
should never make you feel that way
the rain
will bring the violets of may
tears in vain
so honey please don't be that way
as long as we
will see it through
you'll have me
and i'll have you
sweetheart
tomorrow is another day
don't break my heart
oh honey, please don't be that way
don't cry
don't cry, don't cry
oh honey, please don't be that way
oh honey, please don't be that way
clouds in the sky
dig those crazy sky
should never make you feel that way
so don't be that way
dig the rain
pitter pitter pitter pitter patter
bring the violets of may
pitter patter of the rain drops
tears in vain
tears, tears
so honey please don't be that way
don't be that way
as long as we
will see it through
oh baby, you'll have me
and i'll have you
sweetheart
tomorrow is another day
tomorrow is another day
don't break my heart
oh honey, please don't be that way
looky here, baby don't cry
oh honey, please don't be that way
clouds in the sky
should never make you feel that way
yeah, don't cry
honey, please don't be that way
clouds in the sky
oh honey, please don't be that way
no honey, i'll never be that way"
"missed the saturday dance
heard they crowded the floor
couldn't bear it without you
don't get around much anymore
thought i'd visit the club
got as far as the door
they'd have asked me about you
don't get around much anymore
darling, i guess my mind's more at ease
but nevertheless, why stir up memories
been invited on dates
might have gone but what for
awfully different without you
don't get around much anymore"
"the sleepless nights   the daily fights
the quick toboggan   when you reach the heights
i miss the kisses   and i miss the bites
i wish i were in love again
the broken dates   the endless waits
the lovely loving   and the hateful hates
the conversation   with the flying plates
i wish i were in love again
no more pain   no more strain
now i'm sane   but i would rather be punched   drunk
the pulled out fur   of cat and cur
the fine mismating   of a him and her
i've learned my lesson   but i wish i were
in love again
the furtive sigh   the blackened eye
the words: ""i love you   'til the day i day""
the self deception   that believes the lie
i wish i were in love again
when love congeals   it soon reveals
the faint aroma   of performing seals
the double crossing   of a pair of heals
i wish i were in love again
no, no more care   no, no despair
now i'm all there    but i'd rather be puncdrunk
believe me sir   i much prefer
the classic battle   of a him and her
i don't like quiet   and i wish i were"
"try to think that love&acute;s not around
but it&acute;s uncomfortably near
my old heart ain&acute;t gaining no ground
because my angel eyes ain&acute;t here
angel eyes, that old devil sent
they glow unbearably bright
need i say that my love&acute;s mispent
mispent with angel eyes tonight
so drink up all you people
order anything you see
have fun you happy people
the laughs and the jokes on me
pardon me but i got to run
the fact&acute;s uncommonly clear
got to find who&acute;s now number one
and why my angel eyes ain't here
oh, where is my angel eyes
excuse me while i disappear
angel eyes, angel eyes."
"it's a lovely day today
so whatever you've got to do
you've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true
and i hope whatever you've got to do
is something that can be done by two
for i'd really like to stay
it's a lovely day today
and whatever you've got to do
i'd be so happy to be doing it with you
but if you've got something that must be done
and it can only be done by one
there is nothing more to say
except it's a lovely day for saying
it's a lovely day
it's a lovely day today
and whatever i've got to do
i've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true
but perhaps whatever i've got to do
is something that can be done by two
if it is then you could stay
it's a lovely day today
but you're probably busy too
so i suppose there's nothing we can do
for if you've got something that must be done
and it can only be done by one
there is nothing more to say
except it's a lovely day for saying
it's a lovely day
it's a lovely day today
if you've something that must get done
now don't forget two heads are better than just one
and besides i'm certain if you knew me
you'd find i'm very good company
won't you kindly let me stay?
it's a lovely day today
and whatever we've got to do
we've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true
and i know whatever we've got to do
is something that can be done by two
i'll say it's a lovely day for saying"
"some folks were meant to live in clover,
but they are such a chosen few.
and clover being green is something i've never seen
'cause i was born to be blue.
when there's a yellow moon above me,
they say there's moonbeams i should view
but moonbeams being gold are something i can't behold
'cause i was born to be blue.
when i met you the world was bright and sunny
when you left the curtain fell
i'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny
now my world's a faded pastel
well, i guess i'm luckier than some folks,
i've known the thrill of loving you.
and that alone is more than i was created for"
"if a custom tailored vet
asks me out for something wet
when the vet begins to pet  i cry hooray.
but i'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
yes, i'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
i've been asked to have a meal
by a big tycoon in steel,
if the meal includes a deal, accept i may.
but i'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
yes, i'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
there's an oil man known as tex
who is keen to give me checks.
and his checks, i fear, means that tex is here to stay.
but i'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
yes, i'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
from ohio mister thorn
calls me up from night till morn
mister thorn once cornered corn and that ain't hay
but i'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
yes, i'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
from milwaukee mister fritz
often dines me at the ritz
mister fritz invented schlitz and schlitz must pay
but i'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
yes, i'm always true to you, darlin', in my way.
mister harris, plutocrat, wants to give my cheek a pat
if the harris pat means a paris hat, pay, pay!
but i'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
yes, i'm always true to you, darlin', in my way."
"at any gambling casino
from monte carlo to reno
they tell you that a beginner
comes out a winner
beginner fishing for flounder
will catch a 17 pounder
that's what i always heard
and thought absurd,
but now, i believe every word
for i've got beginner's luck
the first time that i'm in love
i'm in love with you
gosh, i'm lucky
i've got beginner's luck
there never was such a smile
or such eyes of blue

where the first time is the last time
i've got beginner's luck
lucky, through and through

i'm in love with you
the thing we've begun

"a fine romance, with no kisses
a fine romance, my friend this is
we should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
but you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
a fine romance, you won't nestle
a fine romance, you won't wrestle
i might as well play bridge
with my old maid aunt
i haven't got a chance
this is a fine romance
a fine romance, my good fellow
you take romance, i'll take jello
you're calmer than the seals
in the arctic ocean
at least they flap their fins
to express emotion
a fine romance with no quarrels
with no insults and all morals
i've never mussed the crease
in your blue serge pants
i never get the chance"
"i was a stranger in the city
out of town were the people i knew
i had that feeling of self pity
what to do, what to do, what to do
the outlook was decidedly blue
but as i walked through the foggy streets alone
it turned out to be the luckiest day i've known
a foggy day, in london town
had me low, had me down
i viewed the morning, with much alarm
british museum, had lost its charm
how long i wondered,
could this thing last
but the age of miracles, hadn't passed
for suddenly, i saw you there
and through foggy london town,
the sun was shining everywhere
for suddenly, i saw you there
and through foggy london town,
the sun was shining everywhere
everywhere
everywhere"
"the moon is the same moon above you
aglow with its cool evening light
but shining at night, in tunisia
never does it shine so bright
the stars are aglow in the heavens
but only the wise understand
that shining at night in tunisia
they guide you through the desert sand
words fail, to tell a tale
too exotic to be told
each night's a deeper night
in a world, ages old
the cares of the day seem to vanish
the ending of day brings release
each wonderful night in tunisia
where the nights are filled with peace"
"i don't know what day it is
or if it's dark or fair
somehow, that's just the way it is
and i don't really care
i go to this or that place
i seem alive and well
my head is just a hat place
my breast an empty shell
and i've a faded dream to sell
all alone, all at sea
why does nobody care for me?
when there's no love to hold my love
why is my heart so frail?
like a ship without a sail.
out on the ocean,
sailors can use a chart
i'm on the ocean
guided by just a lonely heart
still alone, still at sea
still there's no one to care for me
when there's no hand to hold my hand
life is a loveless tale
for a ship without a sail
still alone, still at sea
still there's no one to care for me
when there's no hand to hold my hand
life is a loveless tale"

"verse:
i've just finished writing an advertisement
calling for a boy.
no half hearted romeo or flirt is meant;
that's the kind i'd not employ.
though anybody interested can apply,
he must know a thing to qualify.
for instance:
refrain 1:
teddy:
he must be able to dance.
he must make life a romance.
i said a boy wanted,
one who can smile;
boy wanted,
lovable style.
he must be tender and true,
and he must know how to woo.
i know we'll get acquainted mighty soon,
out in a garden 'neath a harvest moon;
and if he proves to be the right little laddie,
i'll make him glad
he'll answer my ad!
refrain 2:
toots:
to be the boy of my choice,
he needn't own a rolls royce.
the kind of boy wanted*
needn't have gold;
boy wanted,
mustn't be cold.
if he has oodles of charm,
i'll even life on a farm.
if he fits into my picture of a home,
i'll be so nice he'll never have to roam.**
yes, if he proves to be the right little laddie,
i'll make him glad
he answered my ad.
refrain 3:
babe:
he must like musical shows,
and he must wear snappy clothes.
yes, that is my story,
and to it i'll stick;
there's no glory
in having a hick.
he must know how to say ""yes!""***
when i look at a new dress.
oh, i'll be ready when the right one calls,
and i'll start vamping him until he falls;
and if he subsidises me, oh, sweet daddy!
i'll make him glad
he answered my ad!
refrain 4:
bunny:
the movies he must avoid,
he'll know his nietzsche and freud.
i said a boy wanted,
one who knows books;
boy wanted
needn't have looks.
he must be such a saint,
but, oh! he dassent say 'ain't.'
i don't care if his bankroll totals naught,
for we can live on love and food for thought.
if he's a scholar, when i see him i'll holler,
'my lad, i'm glad
you answered my ad!'

no half hearted romeo or flirt is meant;
that's the kind i won't employ.

the sort of boy wanted
must have a smile

he must be tender and true,

i'll want him morning, night and afternoon.
so if you know of one who's wanting employment,
just tell him that
i'm wanting a boy!
refrain 2:
to be the boy of my choice,
he's got to own a rolls royce.
he must be quite reckless
buying me things:
pearl necklace,
diamond rings.
he must be ready to pay
a dozen bills ev'ry day.
i'll simply smothing him with tender care
if i could find a multimillionaire.
so if you could seen one dining at the savoy oh!
just tell him
i'm wanting a boy!
refrain 3:
i won't have anyone small,
he must be handsome and tall.
i said a boy wanted,
beautifully dressed;
boy wanted,
trousers well pressed.
he must have wonderful eyes;
he must wear wonderful ties.
i want a boy who'll always look as though
he's only just come out of savile row.
so if some paris wants a helen of troy oh!
just tell him that
i'm wanting a boy."

"do nothing till you hear from me
pay no attention to what's said
why one should tear the seam of anyone's dream
is over my head
do nothing till you hear from me
at least consider our romance
if you should take the word of others you've heard
i haven't a chance
true, i've been seen with someone new
but does that mean that i'm untrue?
while we're apart, the words in my heart
reveal how i feel about you
some kiss may cloud my memory
and other arms may hold a thrill
but please do nothing till you hear it from me
and you never will!"

get that cheek to cheek look in your eye
little boy, go, better grab your honey
girl, you’d better grab your guy
it’s time for dream, dream dancing
dream, dream dancing.
out on the dance floor everybody’s all alone
just squeeze my hand and then let’s close our eyes
and listen to the man play on the saxophone
as we swerve cross the floor, just there, stars in the sky
dream, dream dancing
dream, dream dancing.
close your eyes, hold me tight
let the night last forever .
and i don’t mind if the sun never shines
and i don’t care if tomorrow never comes
as long as we are … dream, dream dancing
dream, dream dancing.
when the joint shuts down
and i’m still feeling up
we go on home for a little cosy cover
for our favorite station on the radio
we’ll be dancing close
we’ll be dancing slow.

why do i dream silly dreams that i feel won't come

caught in the dark of the sea.
i long to speak of my love,
but you don't come to me.
so i go on asking if maybe one day you'll care.
i tell my sad little dreams to the soft evening air.
i am quite hopeless it seems.
two things i know how to do.
one is to dream,
two is loving you.

"when an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
and touches with her hand the summer trees,
perhaps you'll understand what memories i own.
there's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,
a winding country lane all russet brown,
a frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
that spring of ours that started so april hearted,
seemed made for just a boy and girl.
i never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
so early, early.
darling if you care, please, let me know,
i'll meet you anywhere, i miss you so."
"i know too well that i'm just wasting precious time
in thinking such a thing could be
that you could ever care for me
i'm sure you hate to hear
that i adore you, dear
but grant me
just the same
i'm not entirely to blame
for love
you'd be so easy to love
so easy to idolize
all others above
so worth the yearning for
so swell to keep every homefire burning for
we'd be so grand at the game
so carefree together
that it does seem a shame
that you can't see
your future with me"

"everytime we say goodbye, i die a little,
everytime we say goodbye, i wonder why a little,
why the gods above me, who must be in the know.
think so little of me, they allow you to go.
when you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
i can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
there's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to
minor,
everytime we say goodbye.

"verse 1
don't stamp your foot at me,
it's impolite
to stamp your foot at me
is not quite right.
at man's ingratitude
a woman winks,
but such an attitude just stinks.
refrain 1
i have eyes for you to give you dirty looks.
i have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife i'm learning to do
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
i've a powerful anesthesia in my fist,
and the perfect wrist to give your neck atwist.
there are hammerlock holds,
i've mastered a few,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
share for share, share alike,
you get struck each time i strike.
you for me  me for me 
i'll give you plenty of nothing.
i'm not yours for better but for worse,
and i've learned to give the well known witches' curse.
i've a terrible tongue, a temper for two,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
verse 2
don't raise your voice at me,
that's very rude.
to raise your voice at me
is rather crude.
it's wrong essentially when woman yells,
and confidentially, it smells.
refrain 2
i'll converse with you on politics at length,
i'll protect you with my superhuman strength.
if you're ever attacked i'll scream and say , ""boo!''
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
i will never stray from home, i'll just stay put,
'cause i've got a brand new thing called athlete' s foot.
i'm a victim of colds, anemia, too,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
off to bed we will creep,
then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
till the birds start to peep.
i'll give you plenty of nothing.
i'll be yours forever and a day
if the first good breeze does not blow me away.
you're enough for one man, that's why i'll be true,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
encore
you may have some things that i can't use at all.
when i look at you, your manly gifts are small.
i've a wonderful way of saying adieu,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
you won't know how good i am until you try
and you'll let my well of loneliness run dry.
i've a marvelous way of telling you no,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
and ev'rything you want belongs to me!
and ev' rything you need belongs to me!
reprise
verse
life has no shape or form
and no design.
it isn't life without
that fool of mine.
i used to gad about
with any chap
and now i'm sad about my sap.
refrain
he's a living thing that isn't quite alive,
he has brains enough for any child of five.
oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim,
but ev'rything i've got belongs to him.
he's a naughty brat that can't be left alone.
he has eyes for ev'ry skirt except my own.
even under a tree, he grabs for the limb,
but ev'rything i've got belongs to him.
something beats in his chest,
but it's just a pump at best.
i'm for him, he's for him.
he gives me plenty of nothing.
when i see that funny face, i know
something scared his mother twenty years ago.
but i'll never let go, he'll never be free!
till ev'rything he's got belongs to me!
coda

"you left me a horse from texas,
a house with installments due,
a letter with lots of x s
everything but you.
you left me some beans from boston,
a bicycle built for two,
a memory to get lost in,
everything but you.
each day was so g** and so daring,
i loved every breathtaking minute,
for how could i know i was sharing
a kiss without a future in it.
you left me a dream to room with,
a coffee pot from peru,
a knife and fork to spoon with,
everything but you.

"got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
that pit a pats through my brain;
so darn persistent,
the day isn't distant
when it'll drive me insane.
comes in the morning
without any warning,
and hangs around me all day.
i'll have to sneak up to it
someday, and speak up to it.
i hope it listens when i say:
refrain:
fascinating rhythm,
you've got me on the go!
fascinating rhythm,
i'm all a quiver.
when a mess you're making!
the neighbours want to know
why i'm always shaking
just like a flivver.
each morning i get up with the sun  
start a hopping,
never stopping  
to find at night no work has been done.
i know that
once it didn't matter  
but now you're doing wrong;
when you start to patter
i'm so unhappy.
won't you take a day off?
decide to run along
somewhere far away off  
and make it snappy!
oh, how i long to be the man i used to be!
fascinating rhythm,"
"""never know how much i love you
never know how much i care
when you put your arms around me
i get a fever that's so hard to bear
you give me fever
when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight

in the morning
fever all through the night
sun lights up the daytime
moon lights up the night
i light up when you call my name
and you know i'm gonna treat you right
you give me fever
when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
fever
in the morning
fever all through the night
everybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
fever isn't such a new thing
fever started long ago
romeo loved juliet
juliet she felt the same
when he put his arms around her,
he said julie, baby, you're my flame.
thou givest fever
when we kisseth
fever with thy flaming youth
fever, i'm a fire
fever, yay, i burn forsooth
captain smith and pocahontas
had a very mad affair
when her daddy tried to kill him,
she said daddy, no, don't you dare
he gives me fever,
with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
fever i'm his mrs.
daddy, won' t you treat him right
now you've listened to my story,
here's the point that i have made
chicks were born to give you fever
be it farenheit or centigrade
they give you fever
when you kiss them
fever if you live, you learn
fever, till you sizzle
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn.
what a lovely way to burn."""

it's bound to be forever more
it's plain to see
we found, by finding each other
the love we waited for

with a world of love in store

only two for tea dear, from this moment on,
from this happy day, no more blue songs,
only whoop dee doo songs,

got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight,

every care is gone, from this moment on."
"frosty the snowman
was a jolly happy soul
with a corncob pipe and a button nose
and two eyes made out of coal
frosty the snowman
is a fairytale they say
he was made of snow
but the children know
how he came to life one day
there must have been some magic
in that old silk hat they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around
frosty the snowman
was alive as he could be
and the children say
he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me
frosty the snowman
knew the sun was hot that day
so he said let's run
and we'll have some fun
now before i melt away
down to the village
with a broomstick in his hand
running here and there all around the square
saying catch me if you can
he led them down the streets of town
right to the traffic cop
and he only paused a moment when
he heard him holler stop
frosty the snowman
had to hurry on his way
but he waved goodbye
saying don't you cry
i'll be back again some day
thumpety thump thump
thumpety thump thump
look at frosty go
thumpety thump thump
thumpety thump thump"

my man's gone away
he left his mama cold

in light and free jubilee days
in that sunny land of milk and honey

when cares pursue ya, hallelujah!
gets you through the darkest day

here this! here that!
shine your shoes and square your hat
they'll give 'ya the boot if 'ya don't salute
hup one two!
satan lies a waitin'

it gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...
here's to my best romance, here's to my worst romance
here's to my first romance   ages ago
here's to the boys i've kissed, and to complete the list
here's to the boys who said ""no!""
love, love, hooray for love
who was ever too blase for love
make this the night for love
if we have to fight, let's fight for love
some sigh and cry for love
ah, but in pa ree they die for love
some waste away for love
just the same   hooray for love!
<musical interlude>
it's the rocket to the moon, with a touch of ""clare de lune""
it gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...
some trust to fate for love,
others have to take off weight for love
some go berzerk for love
loafers even go to work for love
sad songs are sobbed for love
people have their noses bobbed for love
some say we pay for love
just the same   hooray for love!"

a baby
will climb upon your knee and put its arms about you

how can i measure each and every part?
how can i tell you how much i love you?
how can i measure just how much i do?
how much do i love you?
i'll tell you no lie
how deep is the ocean?
how high is the sky?
how many times a day do i think of you?
how many roses are sprinkled with dew?
how far would i travel
to be where you are?
how far is the journey
from here to a star?

how much would i cry?
how deep is the ocean?"

often i've had to caress men
five or ten, dollars then, i'd collect from all those yes men
don't be sad, i must add, that they meant no more than chess men
darling, can't you see?
'twas for charity?
though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
who'd have thought, i'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?
i could cry salty tears
where have i been all these years?
little wow, tell me now
how long has this been goin' on?
there were chills up my spine
and some thrills i can't define
listen sweet, i repeat
how long has this been goin' on?
oh, i feel that i could melt
into heaven i'm hurled
i know how columbus felt
finding another world
kiss me once, then once more
what a dunce i was before
what a break, for heaven's sake
how long has this been goin' on?
kiss me twice, once more, thrice, make it four
what a break, for heaven's sake"

i know where to find the boys
i don't go through a club or two
i just find you and there are the boys
to get you alone i strive
you ask me to tea at five
i find you then with other men
and wonder when my chance will arrive
how's chances, say, how are the chances
of making you love me the way i love you
how many young men must i fight with
to be in right with
in right with you
how's chances for one of those glances
a glimpse of the heaven i'm longing to see
how's chances to end all your romances
and start taking your chances with me
my castle will need some restoring

oh, what is this sudden jolt?
i feel like a frightened colt,
just hit by a thunderbolt. i am in love.
i knew the odds were against me before,
i had no flair for flaming desire,
but since the gods gave me you to adore,
i may lose but i refuse to fight the fire,
so come and enlighten my days and never depart.

for i am wildly in love with you,
and so in need of a stampede of love.

on your smile, so sweet, so tender

to be mad, to be yours alone!
grand to see your face, feel your touch,
hear your voice say i'm all your own.

life was no prize.
i wanted love and here it was
shining out of your eyes.

that would bore me terrifically too
but i get a kick out of you
i get a kick every time i see you standing there before me

but i'm in love and i know what time it is

well, i have sought and my what a climb it is

it changes wth the hours
when he's near i'm fair and warmer
when he's gone i'm cloudy with showers
and motion like the ocean
it's either sink or swim
when a woman loves a man
like i love him
never treats me sweet and gentle
the way he should
i got it bad and that ain't good
my poor heart is sentimental
not made of wood
i got it bad and that ain't good
but whne the weekend's over
i end up like i started out
just cryin' my lil' heart out
he don't love me
like i love im
no, nobody could
i got it bad and that ain't good
so bad, so bad
i got it bad, so bad
though folks with good intentions
tell me to save my tears
i'm glad
i'm mad about you
lord above me
make him love me
the way he should
like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
the things i tell my pillow
no woman should
i got it bad, and that ain't good"

i got no lock on the door   that's no way to be
they can steal the rug from the floor   that's ok with me

i got rhythm, i got music
i got my man

"strange
how a dreary world can suddenly change
to a world as bright as the evening star
queer
what a difference when your vision is clear
and you see things as they really are
i used to be color blind
but i met you and now i find
there's green in the grass
there's gold in the moon
there's blue in the skies
that semi circle that was always hanging about
is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
and you brought the colors out
believe me it's really true
till i met you i never knew
a setting sun could paint such beautiful skies
i never knew there were such lovely colors
and the big surprise
is the red in your cheeks
the gold in your hair"

can't sleep nights and suffer all the day

i never wink back at fireflies
but now that the stars are in your eyes
i'm beginning to see the light
i never went in for afterglow
or candlelight on the mistletoe
but now when you turn the lamp down low
i'm beginning to see the light
used to ramble through the park
shadowboxing in the dark
then you came and caused a spark
that's a four alarm fire now
i never made love by lantern shine
i never saw rainbows in my wine
but now that your lips are burning mine"

losing at backgammon

it's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
that it's all right with me

i'm strangely attracted to you
there's someone i'm trying so hard to forget
don't you want to forget someone, too?

they're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips

why am i sitting alone tonight,
when i could be out where the lights are bright?
it's all because of jim, it's all because of jim.
why am i wasting these precios years?
why am i crying these bitter tears?
it's all because of jim, it's all because of jim.
:
jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers,
jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours,
don't know why i'm so crazy for jim.
jim never tells me i'm his hearts desire.
i never seem to set his love afire
gone are the years i've wasted on him.
sometimes when i get feeling low,
i say ""let's call it quits.""
then i hang on and let him go
breaking my heart in bits.
some day i know tht jim will up and leave me,
but even if he does you can believe me,"

in a one horse open sleigh
through the fields we go
laughing all the way.
bells on bob tail ring
making spirits bright
what fun it is to ride and sing
a sleighing song tonight.

jingle all the way,
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh, o
jingle bells, jingle bells
jingle all the way,
oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh.
a day or two ago
i thought i'd take a ride
and soon miss fanny bright
was seated by my side;
the horse was lean and lank
misfortune seemed his lot,
we ran into a drifted bank
and there we got upsot.
a day or two ago
the story i must tell
i went out on the snow
and on my back i fell;
a gent was riding by
in a one horse open sleigh
he laughed at me as
i there sprawling laid
but quickly drove away.
now the ground is white,
go it while you're young,
take the girls along
and sing this sleighing song.
just bet a bob tailed bay,
two forty as his speed,
hitch him to an open sleigh"
"johnny could only sing one note
and the note he sings was this
ah!
poor johnny one note
sang out with ""gusto""
and just overlorded the place
poor johnny one note
yelled willy nilly
until he was bleu in the face
for holding one note was his ace
couldn't hear the brass
couldn't hear the drum
he was in a class
by himself, by gum!
poor johnny one note
got in aida
indeed a great chance to be brave
he took his one note
howled like the north wind
brought forth wind that made critics rave,
while verdi turned round in his grave!
couldn't hear the flute
or the big trombone
ev'ry one was mute
johnny stood alone.
cats and dogs stopped yapping
lions in the zoo
all were jealous of johnny's big trill
thunder claps stopped clapping,
traffic ceased its roar,
and they tell us niag'ra stood still.
he stopped the train whistles,
boat whistles,
steam whistles,
cop whistles,
all whistles bowed to his skill
sing johnny one note,
sing out with ""gusto"" and
just overwhelm all the crowd
ah!
so sing johnny one note, out loud!!
sing johnny one note"

for i need you and you need me
no reprimanding
full understanding
that we can live in harmony
the world is prose y
when we are fighting
lets make it rosy
by reuniting
two heads are better
than what i hear
let's kiss and make up
no use to break up
we need each other, dear
why should we shake up
a new earthquake up
take the uptake up
and soon they'll bake up
a wedding cake up
let's kiss and make up"
"i never traveled further north than old van courtland park
and never further south than the aquarium
i've seen the charm of jersey city, but first let me remark
i saw it from the empire state solarium
but we've been putting nickels in the postal savings bank
and when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
and i don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
i mean a cabin de luxe tour
someday we'll go places
new lands and new faces
the day we quit punching the clock
the future looks pleasant,
but at present
let's take a walk around the block.
you're just the companion
i want at grand canyon
for throwing old blades down the rock
the money we have`ll go for travel
meantime, let's walk around the block.
gangway, we'll begin
when our, ship comes in
i'll sit on your lap
all over the map
to london in may time
to venice in play time
to paris in time for a frock
to boston in bean time
darling, meantime
let's take a walk around the block.
in winter at christmas,
we'll visit the isthmus
and see how they lock up a lock
and then in caracas, on a jackass,
we'll take a ride around the block.
we'll keep to our promise,
to visit st. thomas
and then at jamaica we'll dock
the prospect is thrilling,
still i am willing,
just now to walk around the block.
onward, to cathay
then to mandalay
boom on to bangkok
p'r'aps vladivostok
we'll send the folks cables
accumulate labels
buy souvenirs till we're in hock
but since we are flat in old manhattan
let's take a walk around the block."
"let's fall in love
i have a feeling, it's a feeling,
i'm concealing, i don't know why

but i adore you
so strong for you
why go on stalling
i am falling
our love is calling
why be shy?
let's fall in love
why shouldn't we fall in love?
our hearts are made of it
let's take a chance
why be afraid of it
let's close our eyes and make our own paradise
little we know of it, still we can try
to make a go of it
we might have an end for each other
to be or not be
let our hearts discover
let's fall in love
why shouldn't we fall in love
now is the time for it, while we are young
let's fall in love
we might have and end for each other

what can you do?
old girl, you're through
sit there, and count your little fingers
unlucky, litle girl blue
sit there, and count the raindrops
falling on you
it's time you knew
all you can count on is the raindrops
that fall on little girl blue
no use, old girl
you may as well surrender
your hope is getting slender
why won't somebody send a tender
blue boy
to cheer little girl blue?

"back in the days of knights in armor
there once lived a lovely charmer
swimming in the rhine
her figure was divine
she had a yen for all the sailors
fishermen and gobs and whalers

she created quite a stir
and i want to be like her
i want to be like that gal on the river
who sang her song to the ships passing by
she had the goods and how she could deliver
the lorelei
she used to love in a strange kind of fashion
with lots of hey ho de ho hi de hi
and i can guarantee i'm full of passion
like the lorelei
i'm treacherous, yeah yeah
oh, i just can't hold myself in check
i'm lecherous, yeah yeah
i want to bite my initials on a sailor's neck
each affair has a kick and a wallop
for what they crave, i can always supply
i want to be just like that other trollop

i go to work.

softly, in my ear you, breathe a flame
lover, when we're dancing, keep on glancing, in my eyes
till loves own entrancing, music dies
all of my future is in you
your every plan i design
promise you'll always continue
to be mine
lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
lover, i surrender, to my heart
lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
when, two lips of coral, want to kiss
i say the devil is in you, and to resist you, i try
but if you didn't continue, i would die

"oh, lullaby of birdland that's what i
always hear, when you sigh,
never in my word land could there be ways to reveal
in a phrase how i feel
have you ever heard two turtle doves
bill and coo when they love?
that's the kind of magic music we make with our lips
when we kiss
and there's a weepy old willow
he really knows how to cry
that's how i'd cry in my pillow
if you should tell me farewell and goodbye
lullaby of birdland whisper low
kiss me sweet, and we'll go
flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
all because we're in love
lullaby, lullaby

"i used to visit all the very g** places
those come what may places
where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
to get the feel of life
from jazz and cocktails
the girls i knew had sad and sullen gray faces
with distingue traces
that used to be there
you could see where they'd been washed away
by too many through the day
twelve o'clock tales
then you came along with your siren song
to tempt me to madness
i thought for awhile that your poignant smile
was tinged with the sadness
of a great love for me
ah yes, i was wrong
again, i was wrong
life is lonely again
and only last year
everything seemed so sure
now life is awful again
a trough full of hearts could only be a bore
a week in paris could ease the bite of it
all i care is to smile in spite of it
i'll forget you, i will
while yet you are still
burning inside my brain
romance is mush
stifling those who strive
so i'll live a lush life in some small dive
and there i'll be, while i rot with the rest"
" thank you. we'd like to do something for you now.
we haven't heard a girl sing it. and since it's so popular,

when i'm so crazy over you"
"my romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
my romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
no month of may, no twinkling stars
no hide away, no softly guitars
my romance doesn't need a castle rising in spain
nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
wide awake i can make my most fantastic dreams come true
my romance doesn't need a thing but you"
"this moment, this minute
and each second in it
will leave a glow upon the sky
and as time goes by, it will never die
this will be my shining hour
calm and happy and bright
and in my dreams, your face will flower
through the darkness of the night
like the lights of home before me
or an angel, who's watching o'er me
this will be my shining hour
'til i'm with you again
<instrumental>
this will be my shining hour"
"the man who only lives for making money
lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
likewise the man who works for fame
there's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
the fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
fall in love and you won't regret it
that's the best work of all, if you can get it
holding hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky
nice work if you can get it
and you can get it if you try
strolling with the one girl
sighing sigh after sigh
nice work if you can get it
and you can get it if you try
just imagine someone
waiting at the cottage door
where two hearts become one
who could ask for anything more?
loving one who loves you
and then taking that vow
it's nice work if you can get it
and if you get it, won't you tell me how?""
just imagine someone
waiting at the cottage door
where two hearts become one
who could ask for anything more?
loving one who loves you
and then taking that vow
nice work if you can get it"
"like the beat beat beat of the tom tom
when the jungle shadows fall
like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
as it stands against the wall
like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
when the summer shower is through
so a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
night and day, you are the one
only you beneath the moon and under the sun
whether near to me, or far
it's no matter darling where you are
i think of you
night and day, day and night, why is it so
that this longing for you follows wherever i go
in the roaring traffic's boom
in the silence of my lonely room
i think of you
night and day, night and day
under the hide of me
there's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of
me
and its torment won't be through
'til you let me spend my life making love to you"
"all the world's great lovers have been glorified
history placed them in a romantic set
in between book covers they are side by side
but the real thing hasn't been written yet
now it can be told
told in all its glory
now that we have met
the world may know the sentimental story
the greatest romance they ever knew
is waiting to
unfold
now it can be told
as an inspiration
every other tale
of boy meets girl is just an imitation
the great love story
has never been told before
but now"
"from the island of manhattan to the coast of gold
from north to south, from east to west
you are the love, i love the best
you're the dreamboat in the sweetest story ever told
a dream i sought, both night and day
for years through all, the u.s.a.
the star i hitched my wagon to
is very obviously you
of thee i sing, baby
summer, autumn, winter, spring, baby.
you're my silver lining,
you're my sky of blue
there's a lovelight shining
just because of you.
of thee i sing, baby,
you have got that certain thing, baby
shining star and inspiration
worthy of a mighty nation,
of thee i sing.
<musical interlude>
of thee i sing, baby,
you have got that certain thing, baby
shining star and inspiration
worthy of a mighty nation,
of thee i sing."
"if you say my singing is off key, my love
you will hurt my feelings, don't you see, my love?
i wish i had an ear like yours, a voice that would behave
all i have is feeling and the voice god gave
you insist my music goes against the rules
yes, but rules were never made for love sick fools
i wrote this little song for you, but you don't care
it's a crooked song, ah, but, all my heart is there
the thing that you would see if you would play your part
is even if i'm out of tune i have a gentle heart
i took your picture with my trusty rolleiflex
and now all i have developed is a complex
possibly in vain, i hope you'll weaken, oh my love
and forget those rigid rules that undermine my dream
of a life of love and music with someone
who'll understand
that even though i may be out of tune
when i attempt to say how much i love you
all that matters is the message that i bring which is:
my dear, one, i love you"
"listen to my tale of woe,

"never thought i'd ever meet a man like you
who could make my life complete, by dreams come true
the many men i'd known for years all seemed the same
they kept on boring me to tears, and then you came
i was taken off my feet, what could i do
i was above love before,
but now i love love, because you're
oh, oh so nice
awake or sleeping, it seems
that you keep creeping in my dreams
and it's so nice
when you are near me
oh my, oh dear oh dear me, i just fly
to paradise
i was above love before
but now i love love, 'cause you're oh, oh, oh so nice

"once, once i loved
and i gave so much love to this love you were the world to me
once i cried
at the thought i was foolish and proud and let you say goodbye
and then one day
>from my infinite sadness you came and brought me love again
now i know
that no matter what ever befalls i'll never let you go
i will hold you close, make you stay
because love is the saddest thing when it goes away"
"it's quarter to three, there's no one in the place
except you and me
so set 'em' up joe, i got a little story
i think you should know
we're drinking my friend, to the end
of a brief episode
make it one for my baby
and one more for the road
i know the routine, put another nickel
in the machine
i feel kind of bad, can't you make the music
easy and sad
i could tell you a lot, but it's not
in a gentleman's code
make it one for my baby
and one more for the road
you'd never know it, but buddy i'm a kind of poet
and i've got a lot of things i'd like to say
and if i'm gloomy, please listen to me
till it's talked away
well that's how it goes, and joe i know your gettin'
anxious to close
thanks for the cheer
i hope you didn't mind
my bending your ear
but this torch that i found, it's gotta be drowned
or it's gonna explode
make it one for my baby"
"open your window and make a deep sigh.
think about letting the rest of the world go fly.
a kite taking it easy, as easy as pie.
and holding your hand was such a natural high.
i sent flowers, we spent hours.
we could be happy alone in a tent.
think of the money we'd save on rent.
living is easy, as easy as pie.
and holding your hand was such a natural high."
"now eenie meenie minie moe
catch that monkey by the toe
if he hollers let him go
eenie meenie minie moe
scatty ah, pa swings it so does ma
scatty ah, ma swings it so does pa
scatty ah, you swing it so do i
scatty ah, i swing it so do you
when he turns that handle down
music goes around and around
everybody starts to sing
to that organ grinder's swing
tra la, pa swings it so does ma
tra la, ma swings it so does pa
tra la, you swing it so do i
tra la, i swing it so do you
now all the children tag along
just to listen to his song
monkey dancing on a string
to the organ grinder's swing
oh hum
oh hum
oh hum
oh hum, i swing it so do you
drop a nickle in his hat
like a rich aristocrat
every nickle that you fling
makes that organ grinder swing
hi ho
hi ho
hi ho
hi ho, i swing it so do you
eenie meenie minie moe
catch that monkey by the toe
this music makes me want to sing
oh you organ grinder's swing"
"the poets say that all who love are blind
but i'm in love and i know what time it is
the good book says go seek and ye shall find
well, i have sought and my what a climb it is
my life is just like the weather
it changes with the hours
when he's near i'm fair and warmer
when he's gone i'm cloudy with showers
any motion like the ocean
it's either sink or swim
when a woman loves a man
like i love him
never treats me sweet and gentle
the way he should
i got it bad and that ain't good
my poor heart is sentimental
not made of wood
i got it bad and that ain't good
but when the weekend's over, and monday rolls around
i end up like i started out
just cryin' my lil' heart out
he don't love me
like i love him
no, no nobody could
i got it bad and that ain't good
so bad, so bad
i got it so bad, so bad
though folks with good intentions
tell me to save my tears
i'm glad
i'm mad about him
i cant live without him
lord above me
make him love me
the way he should
like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
the things i tell my pillow
no woman should"
"you came to me from out of nowhere,
you took my heart and found it free.
wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
made every hour sweet as a flower for me.
if you should go back to your nowhere,
leaving me with a memory,
i'll always wait for your return out of nowhere,"
"when all the world is a hopeless jumble
and the raindrops tumble all around
heaven opens a magic lane
when all the clouds darken up the skyway
there's a rainbow highway to be found
leading from your windowpane
to a place behind the sun
just a step beyond the rain
somewhere, over the rainbow
way up high
there's a land that i dreamed of
once in a lullabye
somewhere, over the rainbow
skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream
really do come true
some day i'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are
far
behind me
where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
that's where you'll find me
somewhere, over the rainbow
skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream
really do come true
if happy little bluebirds fly
beyond the rainbow"
"perdido,
i look for my heart
it's perdido
i lost it way down in torito
the day the fiesta started
bolero,
i sway that they play the bolero
i kissed me the listing sombrero
and that's when my heart departed
high, was the sun when i held him close
low, was the moon when we said, ""adios""
perdido
my heart ever since is perdido
i know i must go to torito
to find what i lost perdido
high, was the sun when i held him close
low, was the moon when we said, ""adios""
perdido
goodnight perdido"
"if you hear
a song in blue
like a flower crying
for the dew
that was my heart serenading you
my prelude to a kiss
if you hear a song that grows
from my tender sentimental woes
that was my heart trying to compose
a prelude to a kiss
though it's just a simple melody
with nothing fancy
nothing much
you could turn it to a symphony
a shubert tune with a gershwin touch
oh how my love song gently cries
for the tenderness within your eyes
my love is a prelude that never dies
a prelude to a kiss
though it's just a simple melody
with nothing fancy
nothing much
you could turn it to a symphony
a shubert tune with a gershwin touch
oh how my love song so gently cries
for the tenderness within your eyes
my love is a prelude that never dies"
"the moon and you appear to be
so near and yet so far from me
and here am i on a night in june
reaching for the moon and you,
i wonder if we'll ever meet
my song of love is incomplete
i'm just the words, looking for the tune
reaching for the moon and you.
<instrumental interlude>
i'm just the words, looking for the tune"
"one little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
one little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
one little heartache left as a token
one little plaything carelessly broken
remember the night
the night you said, ""i love you""
remember?
remember you vowed
by all the stars above you
remember?
remember we found a lonely spot
and after i learned to care a lot
you promised that you'd forget me not
but you forgot
to remember
into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
you loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
may
but soon the maytime turned to december
you had forgotten, do you remember?"
"turn off that charm
i'm through with love for awhile
i'm through and yet, you have a fabulous smile
so if i forget
remind me
not to find you so attractive
remind me
that the world is full of men
when i start to miss you
to touch your hand
to kiss you
remind me
to count to ten
i had a feeling when i met you
you'd drive me crazy if i let you
but all my efforts to forget you
remind me i'm in love again
i get my heart, well in hand, and i'm certain
that i can take you, or leave you alone
then you begin that beguine again
and boom, i give in , again
i have a will made of steel, my friend
but when it seems about to bend
remind me
not to mention that i love you
remind me
to be sorry that we met
although i adore you
remind me to ignore you
you're one thing i will regret
so when your charm begins to blind me
i'll simply tie my hands behind me
don't let me kiss you please, remind me"
"life's great, life's grand
future, all planned
no more, clouds in the sky
how'm i ridin'? i'm ridin' high
someone, i love
mad for, my love
so long, jonah, goodbye
how'm i ridin'? i'm ridin' high
floating, on a starlit ceiling
doting, on the cards i'm dealing
gloating, because i'm feeling so hap hap happy, i'm slap happy
so ring bells, sing songs
blow horns, beat gongs
our love, never will die
how'm i ridin'? i'm ridin' high

"my heart is heavy as lead
because the blues has done spread
rocks in my bed
of all the people i see
why do they pick on poor me
and put rocks in my bed
all night long i weep
so how can i sleep
with rocks in my bed
there's only two kinds of people
i can't understand
there's only two kinds of people
i can't understand
that's a deceitful woman
and a hard faced man
she took my man away
and ain't goin' bring him back
she took my man away
and ain't goin' bring him back
she's lower than a snake down in a wagon track
i got rocks in my bed
i got rocks in my bed
rocks in my bed
i got rocks in my bed
under loved, over fed
my man's gone, so instead
i got rocks in my bed

"it begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
i do pretty well, till after sundown,
suppertime i'm feelin' sad;
but it really gets bad,
'round midnight.
memories always start 'round midnight
haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
when my heart is still with you,
and ol' midnight knows it, too.
when a quarrel we had needs mending,
does it mean that our love is ending.
darlin' i need you, lately i find
you're out of my heart,
and i'm out of my mind.
let our hearts take wings'
'round midnight, midnight
let the angels sing,
for your returning.
till our love is safe and sound.
and old midnight comes around.
feelin' sad,
really gets bad"
"you know dasher and dancer and prancer and vixen
comet and cupid and donner and blitzen
but do you recall
the most famous reindeer of all
rudolph the red nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose
and if you ever saw it
you would even say it glows
all of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call him names
they never let poor rudolph
join in any reindeer games
then one foggy christmas eve
santa came to say
rudolph with your nose so bright
won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
then how the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee
rudolph the red nosed reindeer"
"where the dreamy volga flows
there's a lonely russian rose
gazing tenderly
down upon her knee
where a baby's brown eyes glisten
listen
ev'ry night you'll hear her croon
a russian lullaby
just a little plaintive tune
when baby starts to cry
rock a bye my baby
somewhere there may be
a land that's free for you and me"

delilah wasn't choosy

and he fell 'neath her spell
with the aid of love and ""hootch""

i'll be waitin' up for heaven
countin' every mile of railroad track
that takes me back
never thought my heart could be so yearny
why did i decide to roam?
gotta take that sentimental journey
sentimental journey home

"when i was a young man courting the girls
i played me a waiting game
if a maid refused me with tossing curls
i'd let the old earth make a couple of whirls
while i plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
and as time came around she came my way
as time came around, she came
oh, it's a long long while from may to december
but the days grow short when you reach september
when the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
and you ain't got time for waiting game
when days dwindle down to a precious few
september november,
and these few golden days i'd share with you
those golden days i share with you
when you meet with the young girls early in the spring
you court them in song and rhyme
they answer with words and a clover ring
but if you could examine the goods they bring
they have little to offer but the songs they sing
and the plentiful waste of time of day
a plentiful waste of time
oh, it's a long, long while from may to december
but the days grow short when you reach september
when the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
one hasn't got time for the waiting game

"drop that long face
come on have your fling
why keep nursing the blues?
if you want this old world on a string
put on your dancing shoes
stop wasting time
put on your dancing shoes
watch your spirits climb
shall we dance
or keep on mopin'?
shall we dance
and walk on air?
shall we give in to despair?
or shall we dance with never a care?
life is short
we're growing older
don't you be an also ran
you'd better dance, little lady
dance, little man"
"she didn't say yes
she didn't say no
she didn't say stay
she didn't say go
she only knew that he had spied her there
and then she knew he sat beside her there
at first there was heard not one little word
then coyly she took one sly little look
and something awoke and smiled inside
her heart began beating wild inside
so what did she do?
i leave it to you
she did just what you'd do too
she didn't say yes
she didn't say no
they very soon stood beside his chateau
they lingered like two poor waifs outside
for well she knew `twas only safe outside
in there it was warm, out there it was cold
the sleet and the storm said, ""better be bold""
she murmured, ""i'm not afraid of ice,
i only wish that i was made of ice""
so what did she do?
i leave it to you
she did just what you'd do too
she didn't say yes
she didn't say no
she wanted to stay
but knew she should go
she wasn't so sure that he'd be good
she wasn't even sure that she'd be good
she wanted to rest
all cuddled and pressed
a palpable part of somebody's heart
she'd love to be on rapport with him
but not behind a bolted door with him
and what did she do?
i leave it to you
she did just what you'd do too
she didn't say yes
she didn't say no
for heaven was near
she wanted it so
above her sweet love was beckoning
and yet she knew there'd be a reckoning
she wanted to climb
but dreaded to fall
so bided her time
and clung to the wall
she wanted to act ad libitum
but feared to lose her equilibrium
so what did she do?
i leave it to you"

only man i ever think of with regret

when an irrepressible smile such as yours
warms an old implacable heart such as mine
don't say no because i insist.
somewhere, somehow,
someone's gonna be kissed.
so en garde who knows what the fates have in store
from their vast mysterious sky?

"they say into your early life romance came
and in this heart of yours burned a flame
a flame that flickered one day and died away
then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
you learned that fools in love soon grow wise
the years have changed you, somehow
i see you now
smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
is that all you really want?
no, sophisticated lady,
i know, you miss the love you lost long ago
and when nobody is nigh you cry"
"once i was a sentimental thing,
threw my heart away each spring;
now a spring romance hasn't got a chance
promised my first dance to winter;
all i've got to show's a splinter for my little fling!
spring this year has got me feeling like a horse that never left the post;
i lie in my room staring up at the ceiling,
spring can really hang you up the most!
morning's kiss wakes tres and flowers,
and to them i'd like to drink a toast;
i walk in the park just to kill lonely hours,
spring can really hang you up the most.
all afternoon those birds twitter twit,
i know the tune, ""this is love, this is it!""
heard it before and i know the score,
and i've decided that spring is a bore!
love seemed sure around the new year,
now it's april, love is just a ghost;
spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear?
spring can really hang you up the most!
spring can really hang you up the most!
spring is here, there's no mistaking
robins building nests from coast to coast;
my heart tries to sing so they won't hear it breaking,
spring can really hang you up the most!
college boys are writing sonnets,
in the ""tender passion"" they're engrossed;
but i'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnets,
spring can really hang you up the most!
love came my way, i hope it would last;
we had our day, now that's all in the past!
spring came along a season of son,
full of sweet promise but womething went wrong!
doctors once prescribed a tonic,
""sulphur and moloasses"" was the dose;
didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,
spring can really hang you up the most!
all alone, the party's over,
old man winter was a gracious host;
but when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover"
"once there was a thing called spring
when the world was writing verses like yours and mine,
all the lads and girls would sing
when we sat at little tables and drank may wine.
now april, may and june
are sadly out of tune
life has stuck a pin in the boat.
spring is here
why doesn't my heart go dancing?
spring is here
why isn't the waltz entrancing?
no desire,
no ambition leads me
maybe it's because nobody needs me
spring is here
why doesn't the breeze delight me?
stars appear
why doesn't the night invite me?
maybe it's because nobody loves me
spring is here, i hear
<instrumental break>
maybe it's because nobody loves me"
"let's build a stairway to the stars
and climb that stairway to the stars
with love beside us
to fill the night with a song
we'll hear the sound of violins
out yonder where the blue begins
the moon will guide us
as we go drifting along.
can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
over the rim of the hills?
can't we sail away on a little dream
settle high on the crest of a thrill?

a lovely lovely stairway to the stars
it would be heaven

a fairy land where no one else could enter
and in the center   just you and me
my heart beat  like a hammer
 arms wound around you tight

through years of endless spring,
the murmur of a brook at eventide.

she's everything on this earth to me.

when your baby says goodbye
that well known flame is mighty hot
as all of us have learned
so handle it with velvet gloves
and you won't get your fingers burned
take love easy, easy
on the free and easy plan
and if you can't take it easy
take it easy as you can
take love easy, easy
never let your feelings show
make it breezy, breezy, easy
easy, easy come and easy go
never smile too brightly brightly
when your heart is riding high
let your heart break, oh so slightly
when your baby says goodbye
that well known flame is mighty hot
as all of us have learned
so handle it, handle it with velvet gloves
and you won't get your fingers burned
take love easy, easy easy
on the free and easy plan
and if you can't take it easy
take it easy as you can
take it easy
take it easy"
"writers: latouche/fetter/duke
here i go again
i hear those trumpets blow again
all aglow again
taking a chance on love
here i slide again
about to take that ride again
starry eyed again
taking a chance on love
i thought that cards were a frame up
i never would try
but now i'm taking the game up
and the ace of hearts is high
things are mending now
i see a rainbow blending now
we'll have a happy ending now
taking a chance on love
here i slip again
about to take that tip again
got my grip again
taking a chance on love
now i prove again
that i can make life move again
in the grove again
taking a chance on love
i walk around with a horseshoe
in clover i lie
and brother rabbit of course you
better kiss your foot good bye
on the ball again
i'm riding for a fall again
i'm gonna give my all again"
"picture you upon my knee
just tea for two
and two for tea
just me for you
and you for me alone
nobody near us to see us or hear us,
no friends or relations,
on weekend vacations.
we won't have it known, dear,
that we own a telephone, dear...
day will break and i'll wake
and start to bake a sugar cake
for you to take for all the boys to see
we'll raise a family
a boy for you
and a girl for me
can't you see how happy we would be..."
"the evening breeze caressed the trees, tenderly
the trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
then you and i came wandering by
and lost in a sigh were we
the shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
i can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
your arms opened wide
and closed me inside
you took my lips you took my love so tenderly"
"that certain feeling
the first time i met you
i hit the ceiling
i could not forget you
you were completely sweet
oh, what could i do?
i wanted phrases
to sing his praises
that certain feeling
the one that they all know
no use concealing
i've got what they call love
now we're together
let's find out whether
you're feeling, that feeling too
i felt it happen
just as you came in view
grew sort of dizzy
thought gee, who is he?
that certain feeling
i'm here to confess it
is so appealing
no words can express it
i can not hide it
i must confide it"
"when you siad yesterday thatit's nearly christmas
what did i want, and i thought
just love me, love me love
that's what i want for christmas
when i walk through a room let them see you need me
walk through a room let them see you love me love me love me
that's what i want for christmas
anyone can wish for all the trinkets in the window
some can even buy the things they see
but the present that i want you'll never find in any window
bring me love and bring it just for me
when you come home at night take me in your arms and hold me
and kiss me and say you love me love me love me
that's what i want for christmas
hold me, kiss me"

oh how i wish you'd drop that anger, and end your cruise
you're just a duffer, who makes me suffer
all the younger set, says your heart's to let
i've got the ""you don't know the half of it, dearie"" blues
mmmm 
i've got the ""you don't know the half of it, dearie"" blues
although i know that love's a gamble, i hate to lose

"i've wined and dined on mulligan stew, and never wished for turkey
as i hitched and hiked and grifted too, from maine to albuquerque
alas, i missed the beaux arts ball, and what is twice as sad
i was never at a party where they honored noel ca ad but social circles spin too fast for me
my ""hobohemia"" is the place to be
i get too hungry, for dinner at eight
i like the theater, but never come late
i never bother, with people i hate
that's why the lady is a tramp
i don't like crap games, with barons and earls
won't go to harlem, in ermine and pearls
won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
that's why the lady is a tramp
i like the free, fresh wind in her hair
life without care
i'm broke, it's o'k
hate california, it's cold and it's damp
that's why the lady is a tramp
i go to coney, the beach is devine
i go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
i find a winchell, and read every line
that's why the lady is a tramp
i like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
i love the rowing, on central park lake
i go to opera and stay wide awake
that's why the lady is a tramp
i like the green grass under my shoes
what can i lose, i'm flat, that's that
i'm alone when i lower my lamp
that's why the lady is a tramp

a few additional verses from the ""ella in berlin"" cd:
girls get massages, they cry and they moan
tell slender ella to leave me alone
i'm not so hot, but my shape is my own
that's why the lady is a tramp
the food at the kopensky is perfect, no doubt
i couldn't tell you wha the ritz is about
drop a nickle in, and coffee comes out
that's why the lady is a tramp
like the sweet, fresh, rain in my face
diamonds and lace, no got, so what?!
for frank sinatra, i whistle and stamp
that's why the lady is a tramp
she's a hobo
she's a scamp
she's a no good kinda tramp"
"someday he'll come along, the man i love
and he'll be big and strong, the man i love
and when he comes my way
i'll do my best to make him stay
he'll look at me and smile,
i'll understand
and in a little while he'll take my hand
and though it seems absurd
i know we both won't say a word
maybe i shall meet him sunday
maybe monday, maybe not
still i'm sure to meet him one day
maybe tuesday will be my good news day
he'll build a little home, just meant for two
from which we'll never roam; who would, would you?
and so all else above i'm waiting for the man i love
""the man i love"" had the odd distinction of becoming a recognized standard despite its having been thrown out of the musical for which it had been written
;  sung in a show that flopped on the road (the 1927 ""strike up the
band"");  added to and then cut from a third musical
;  rejected when ""strike up the band"" was successfully revised in 1929. the reason for
the last situation was ironic: the song had become too well
known!"
"the night is bitter,
the stars have lost their glitter,
the winds grow colder,
and suddenly you're older
and all because of
the man that got away.
no more his eager call,
the writing's on the wall,
the dreams you dreamed have all
gone astray.
the man that won you
has run off and undone you.
that great beginning
has seen it's final inning,
don't know what happened
it's all a crazy game.
no more that all time thrill
for you've been through the mill,
and never a new love will
be the same.
good riddance, good bye.
every trick of his you're on to  
but fools will be fools and where's he gone to?
the road gets rougher,
it's lonelier and tougher.
with hope you burn up,
tomorrow he may turn up.
there's just no letup
the livelong night and day.
ever since this world began
there is nothing sadder than
a one man woman
looking for the man that got away . .

"why do i just wither and forget all resistance
when you and your magic pass by
my heartæš¯ in a dither dear
when youæš®e at a distance
but when you are near, oh my...
its not the pale moon that excites me
that thrills and delights me,
oh no
its just the nearness of you
it isnæš° your sweet conversation
that brings this sensation,
oh no
its just the nearness of you
when youæš®e in my arms
and i feel you so close to me
all my wildest dreams
come true
i need no soft lights to enchant me
if youæš£l only grant me
the right
to hold you ever so tight
and to feel in the night"
"the one i love belongs to somebody else
she means her tender songs for somebody else
and even when i have my arms around her
i know her thoughts are strong for somebody else
the hands i held belong to somebody else
i'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else
it's tough to be alone on the shelf
it's worse to fall in love by yourself
the one i love belongs to somebody else
the one i love belongs to somebody else"
"near barcelona, the peasant crooned
the old traditional spanish tunes
the neapolitan street song sighs
you think of italian skys
each nation has a creative vein
originating a native strain
with folk songs plaintive and others g**
in their own peculiar way
american folk songs, i feel
have a much stronger appeal
the real american folksong is a rag
a mental jag
a rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues
the critics called it a ""joke song"" but now
they've changed their tune, and they like it, somehow
for it's innoculated with a syncopated sort of meter, sweeter
than a classic strain, boy you can't remain, still or quiet, for it's a riot
the real american folksong
is like a fountain of youth
you taste, and it elates you, and then, invigorates you
the real american folksong, the masses coaxed on, is a rag

"my thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
a moment of bliss we spent
our hearts were filled with a song of romance
as into the night we went
and sang to our hearts' content
the song is ended
but the melody lingers on
you and the song are gone
but the melody lingers on
the night was splendid
and the melody seemed to say
""summer will pass away
take your happiness while you may""
there 'neath the light of the moon
we sang a love song that ended too soon
the moon descended
and i found with the break of dawn
you and the song had gone"
"the very thought of you and i forget to do
the little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
i'm living in a kind of daydream
i'm happy as a king
and foolish though it may seem
to me that's everything
the mere idea of you, the longing here for you
you'll never know how slow the moments go till i'm near to you
i see your face in every flower
your eyes in stars above
it's just the thought of you
the very thought of you, my love
<instrumental interlude>
the mere idea of you, the longing here for you

"some day, when i'm awfully low
when the world is cold
i will feel a glow just thinking of you
and the way you look tonight
yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
and your cheeks so soft
there is nothing for me but to love you
and the way you look tonight
with each word your tenderness grows
tearin' my fear apart
and that laugh..wrinkles your nose
touches my foolish heart
lovely ... never, never change
keep that breathless charm
won't you please arrange it ? 'cause i love you
just the way you look tonight

and that laugh that wrinkles your nose
it touches my foolish heart
lovely ... don't you ever change

or two
a certain place i know, frankie
where funny people can have fun

darling
before you can count up
one, two, three. for ...
there's a small hotel
with a wishing well
i
wish that we were there together
there's a bridal suite
one room bright and neat
complete for us to
share together
looking through the window
you can see a distant steeple
not a sign of people    who
wants people?
when the steeple bell says,
""good night, sleep well,""
we'll thank the small hotel
together
we'll creep into our little shell"
"oh will you never let me be?
oh will you never set me free?
the ties that bound us are still around us
thereâ´s no escape that i can see
and still those little things remain
that bring me happiness or pain
a cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces
an airline ticket to romantic places
and still my heart has wings
these foolish things remind me of you.
a tinkling piano in the next apartment
those stumblin'words that told you what my heart meant
a fairground's painted swings
these foolish things
remind me of you.
you came,
you saw,
you conquered me
when you did that to me
i knew somehow this had to be
the winds of march that made my heart a dancer
a telephone that rings but who's to answer
oh, how the ghost of you clings
these foolish things
remind me of you
first daffodils
and long excited cables
and candle lights
on little corner tables
and still my heart has wings
these foolish things remind me of you
the park at evening
when the bell has sounded
the isle de france
with all the gulls around it
the beauty that is spring
these foolish things
remind me of you
how strange,
how sweet,
to find you still,
these things are dear to me
they seem to bring you near to me
the sigh of midnight trains
at empty stations
silk stockings thrown aside
dance invitations
oh how the ghost of you clings
these foolish things
remind me of you
gardenia perfume
lingering on a pillow
wild strawberries
only seven francs a kilo
and still my heart has wings,
these foolish things,
remind me of you
the smile of garbo
and the scent of roses
the waiters whistling
as the last bar closes
the song that crosby sings
these foolish things
remind me of you
how strange
how sweet
to find you still
these things are dear to me
they seem to bring you near to me
the scent of smoldering leaves
the wail of steamers
two lovers on the street
who walk like dreamers
oh how the ghost of you clings
these foolish things"

"you're walkin' along the street, or you're at a party,
or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig,
you're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
that this could be the start of something big.
you're lunching at twenty one and watchin' your diet,
declining a charlotte russe, accepting a fig,
when out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy,
and this could be the start of something big.
there's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend,
who knows what's written in the magic book.
but when a lover you discover at the gate my friend,
invite her in without a second look.
you're up in an aeroplane or dining at sardi's,
or lying at malibu alone on the sand,
you suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
that this could be the start of something grand.
this could be the start of something very big,
why don't you play your part?
please give your heart to me....and see.
this could be the start of something wonderful,
why don't you take a chance?
just try romance with me....and see.
your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money,
or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine,
then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is,

this could be the heart of something...
this could be the start of something big."

wouldst kiss me pretty? wouldst hold my hand?
both thine eyes are cute too, what they do to me
hear me holler, i choose a sweet lollapaloosa in thee

two rooms and kitchen i'm sure would do
give me just a plot of, not a lot of land

to hear those three little words, that's all i'd live for the rest of my days.

three little words, eight little letters which simply mean i love you"

""i'm never a bridesmaid, i'm always a bride""

i married many men, a ton of them
because i was untrue to none of them
because i bumped off every one of them
to keep my love alive
sir paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
at night he was a horse's neck to me
so i performed an appendectomy
to keep my love alive
sir thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night
i bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right
sir philip played the harp, i cussed the thing
i crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
and now he plays where harps are just the thing
to keep my love alive
to keep my love alive
i thought sir george had possibilities
but his flirtations made me ill at ease
and when i'm ill at ease, i kill at ease
to keep my love alive
sir charles came from a sanitorium
and yelled for drinks in my emporium
i mixed one drink, he's in memorium
to keep my love alive
sir francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
i tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly
sir atherton indulged in fratricide,
he killed his dad and that was patricide
one night i stabbed him by my mattress side

love flew out again

not a whisper of despair
but loves own prayer

whisper not a quarrels past
you know we've had our last
so now, we'll be on key constantly
love will whisper on eternally
not a whisper of despair
but sweet tender loves own prayer
own prayer
oh the sentimental tune that died long ago
too soon, too soon
why did we listen
when they said it wouldn't last?
gossiping voices made us break up
but you know we could make up
if we forget them all
and answer cupids call
whispers of trouble are an echo of the past
all it will take to lose
my gloom is just a whisper
not a rumor of your love for me
and that's how its got to be
so now, we be on key constantly
love will whisper on eternally
sing low, sing clear, sweet words in my ear
love will whisper on, eternally"

in the lane, snow is glistening
a beautiful sight,
we're happy tonight.
walking in a winter wonderland.
gone away is the bluebird,
here to stay is a new bird
he sings a love song,
as we go along,
walking in a winter wonderland.
in the meadow we can build a snowman,
then pretend that he is parson brown
he'll say: are you married?
we'll say: no man,
but you can do the job
when you're in town.
later on, we'll conspire,
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid,
the plans that we've made,
walking in a winter wonderland.
in the meadow we can build a snowman,
and pretend that he's a circus clown
we'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
until the other kids knock him down.
when it snows, ain't it thrilling,
though your nose gets a chilling
we'll frolic and play, the eskimo way,

run my fingers thru his curly locks
mend his underwear and darn his socks
fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
wipe his glasses when he read the news
rub his forehead with a gentle touch
mornings after when he's had too much
kiss him gently when he cuddled near
give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see

close the window while he soundly slept
raid the icebox where the food is kept
cook a breakfast that would please him most
eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
wake him gently with a breakfast tray

bring the papers and when they've been read
spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see

you might give a thought to my plea
cast a spell over me
still i say to myself get a hold of
yourself

you go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature
rise

you intoxicate my soul with your eyes
though i'm certain

hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
you go to my head"

i've tried so hard but i fear
you'll always follow me near and far

just when i've learned to forget
i close my eyes, dear, and there you are
you keep coming back like a song
a song that keeps saying, remember
the sweet used to be
that was once you and me
keeps coming back like an old melody
the perfume of roses in may
returns to my room in december
from out of the past where forgotten things belong
you keep coming back like a song"

you're never satisfied until the teardrops start
i tried to shower you with lovin' kisses
but all i ever get from you is naggin' & braggin',

the way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame
i'll bet you wouldn't like it if i did the same
you're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart
you won't be satisfied until you break my heart
the way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame

you'll never know just how much i care
and if i tried i still couldn't hide my love for you
you ought to know for haven't i told you so
a million or more times
you went away and my heart went with you
i speak your name in my every prayer
if there is some other way to prove that i love you
i swear i don't know how"

you're the top, you're a waldorf salad
you're the top, you're a berlin ballad
you're the nimble tread of the feet of fred astaire
you're an o'neal drama, you're whistler's mama, you're camembert
you're a rose, you're inferno's dante
you're the nose, on the great durante
i'm a lazy lout who's just about to stop
but if baby i'm the bottom,"
"when your down and troubled
and you need a helping hand
and nothing, whoa nothing is going right.
close your eyes and think of me
and soon i will be there
to brighten up even your darkest nights.
you just call out my name,
and you know whereever i am
i'll come running, oh yeah baby
to see you again.
winter, spring , summer, or fall,
all you have to do is call
and i'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah.
you've got a freind.
if the sky above you
should turn dark and full of clouds
and that old north wind should begin to blow
keep your head together and call my name out loud
and soon i will be knocking upon your door.
you just call out my name and you know where ever i am
i'll comning running to see you again.
winter, spring, summer or fall
all you got to do is call
and i'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah.
hey, ain't it good to know that you've got a freind?
people can be so cold.
they'll hurt you and desert you.
well they'll take your soul if you let them.
oh yeah, but don't you let them.
you just call out my name and you know wherever i am
i'll come running to see you again.

"you've got what gets me
