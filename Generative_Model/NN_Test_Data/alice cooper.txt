"if there is a tear on my face
it makes me shiver to the bone
it shakes me, babe
it's just a heartache that got caught in my eye
and you know i never cry, i never cry
sometimes i drink more than i need
until the tv's dead and gone
i may be lonely
but i'm never alone
and the night may pass me by
but i'll never cry
take away, take away my eyes
sometimes i'd rather be blind
break a heart, break a heart of stone
open it up but don't you leave it alone
'cuz that's all i got to give you
believe me babe, it ain't been used
my heart's a virgin, it never been tried

you even make your grandma sick
you'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane
you'd gift wrap a leper
and mail him to your aunt jane

well i don't know her
but with a magnifying glance
i just sort of looked her over, hmm
we have a drink or two
well, maybe three
and then suddenly she starts telling me
her life story
she says
baby, if you wanna be my lover
you better take me home
'cause it's a long long way to paradise
and i'm still on my own
told her that i came
from detroit city
and i played guitar
in a long haired rock and roll band
she asked me why
the singer's name was alice
i said listen, baby
you really wouldn't understand
and i said
oh baby, if you wanna
be my lover
you better take me home
'cause it's a long long way to paradise

i'll tell you a bedtime story that's not for all
children. it's a very special story, that only special
children will understand. it's a half awake story, and
it will be better if you close your eyes. it's a
story that takes place in a dream, like other
nightmares you have known. it's a dream that alice has
dreamed. you can dream along with him. you can follow
alice down the staircase, deep, down the stairs to the
pit where he doesn't want to go, but he has to.
if you go to sleep now, steven, you can go down the
long and endless stairway and sing sweet songs to alice
and free him. and if you can't get to sleep, steven,
and in the middle of the night you get out of bed, when
everything is quiet and the trees are still and the
birds are hiding from the dark, you can lie down on
your bedroom floor and press your ear tightly to the
boards. if you listen very carefully you can hear
alice searching for a way out, forever chasing
rainbows.
sleep tight, steven. and have a good night."

jackson in his teens
was planning his escape
he was a crazy little child
new orleans alley playground
grimy faced
he watched the hookers cry
winos were his friends and when he talked to them
they said, ""jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by""
depression settin' in

little candy stores
just pickin' locks and doors
was practice for a two bit petty thief
so jackson went to ritz
and ev'ryone was hip
ritz ran all the rackets there in town
if you need another boy
a trigger or a blade
well, i'm the slickest cat around
yeah, ritz gave him the eye
once over, then he smiled
""yeah, i've got something here in mind
if you meet me here at two
i think you'll like the view
of that long green when you crack that safe tonight""

and i'll be your ears and your eyes

couple of unspectin' guys
and they left poor jackson inside
questions there were few
in fact there were none
when those sheriff's bullets start to fly
lay dying on the floor
with a smokin' forty four
he said, ""i must admit the winos were right""

you'd better believe me it would have been easy to die for you
a million memories flood my brain
drown my sorrow
kill my pain
whets my thirst for you again
just another night to get through

shattered glass and torn up photos on the floor

it would have been nothing to die for you
baby, you're going to need me
you'd better believe me it would have been easy to die for you

are you hell or are you heaven sent
you're much to cold to know how much
you meant to me, yeah
a billion tear drops fallen from my eyes
but it's just a joke now
and i'm laughing at your lies
you make me hard as rock and now i realize

it happened long ago
about a redneck boy
down from tupelo
i got the slick black hair
i played a rock guitar
i liked to shake my hips, man

he ate his weight in country ham
killed on pills and woke in disgraceland
disgraceland
disgraceland
disgraceland
i had a lot of girls
i had a lot of guns
when they found me dead
the whole world was stunned
went to the pearly gates
said, ""i'm the hippest thing""
and peter said ""well son,
we already got ourselves a king""
he lived on southern deep fried spam
killed on pills and woke in disgraceland
disgraceland
disgraceland
disgraceland
he finished his short life
sweaty and bloated and stoned
he ruled his domain and he died on the throne
no ""yes men"", no colonel, he went...
...all alone...
hey, man, that looks like me down there on the floor
i heard the devil cry
real loud and clear
""you were the big man, there
you're just a sideman here
well, i know your face
and i've heard your name
looks like heaven's loss
is gonna be my gain""
he ate his weight in country ham
killed on pills and woke in disgraceland

i broke away from you somehow
and look who's goin' through it now
we're two of a kind

we're not fragile   and we sure don't break easy!
you know it's so hard to cope
when you're just hoping there's hope…
we're all hanging on by a thread
we're all staring at the razor's edge
but we're not going to step off the ledge

our enemy is a cold, indiscriminate monster
it doesn't care if you're old or newborn…it exists to kill
you and i are nothing to it

sinful deeds from all mankind
with death and nature in surprise
behold the wretched sinners rise
to meet the judge's searching eyes
and when the doomed no more can flee
from the flames of misery
assist me while i die
wander through those ever thoughts though if imagined
but come down on it's so easy to resist rest behind my ears upon the planet.
sound another, no part over, won't forget
when we laugh at the fields of regret."

all got your kicks from what you saw up there
eight bucks even buys a folding chair
i was downing seagrams on another flight
and i worked that stage all night long
you were screaming for the villain up there
and i was much obliged
the old road sure screwed me good this time
it's hard to see where the vicious circle ends

you can still hear her laugh
in the shadows on a cold winter's day

i don't wanna know how this nightmare ends
i don`t know why i'm here, why i've fallen from grace

shake up your make up

you may not wake up you'll never wake up you'll never wake up they'll find you face up "
"i was just kicking down the street
and the sun was in my eyes
so i couldn't see the truck

and just seconds off from splattering me

he's alive
i'm alive
i was spitting in the canyon
near the cliff up on the mountain
when an unexpected sneeze
hung me in the breeze
at forty five degrees in the sky
suddenly i felt something
had me by the belt
and in between my praying
swore i heard a stallion neighing
was the ghost of my horse
and i cried, yes i cried
that was the day
my dead pet returned to save my life
that was the day
my dead pet returned to save my life
i'm alive
he's alive
hey, i'm alive
things were getting gory
got caught on territory
belonging to the crutches
in an alley in their clutches
looking kind of dismal that night
well the leader's name was fats
swinging broken baseball bats
things got really frantic
starting jumping in their panic
that was the day
my dead pet returned to save my life
that was the day
my dead pet returned to save my life
i'm alive, i'm alive, real alive
that was the day my dead pet returned
that was the day my dead pet returned

"at the end of the rainbow, there's happiness
and to find it how often i've tried
but my life is a race just a wild goose chase
and all my dreams have been denied
why have i always been a failure
what can the reason be
i wonder if the world's to blame
i wonder if it could be me
i'm always chasing rainbows, watching clouds drifting by
my schemes are just like all my dreams
ending in the sky
some fellows look and find the sunshine
i always look and find the rain
and some fellows make a winning sometime
and i never even make a gain
i'm always chasing rainbows waiting to find the little bluebird in vain."

nothing much has changed
you broke my heart to pieces, babe

well, i ain't angry
that's all come and gone
my arms are still wide open girl
to catch you when you fall
and if someday you realize
just where you belong i'm the man that'll take you in
when all your luck is gone
it's me, it's me
when you need something more
something you're dying for
it's me, it's me
when you can't see too clear
baby, i'm always near
it's me, it's me

all the sex that i missed
was an abstinence blessing to me

was of some varied places where i've never ever been

whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
sometimes love's a loaded gun
and it shoots to kill
somebody saw you at the station"
"i was the boy who said all of my prayers
laid my clean face on the pillow
tucked in real tight, so safe and secure
through the night
i heard a noise, it was probably nothing
it pulled me right out of a dream
if i knew it was you
i'd have jumped out of bed with a scream
i am the one who growls in your closet
i am the one who lives under your bed
get down   back where you started
get down   back into hell
your black soul, you know you're
black hearted
i smell your sulfurous smell
all of my things that i play with in daylight
you turn into monsters at night
my toys were my friends
until you taught them all how to bite
you showed me things little boys
shouldn't see
you scared me with visions of fire
you danced on my bed
with the flames on your head dancing higher
i am the one who growls in your closet
i am the one who lives under your bed
get down   back where you started
get down   back into hell
your black soul, you know you're
black hearted
i smell your sulfurous smell
i tell ya right now
i don't want your reptile embrace
i don't want to follow you down
to your place
i don't want to be a child of disgrace
you can take your whiskey soaked, foaming
at the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup
spewing, sweating blood demon breath out
of my face
get down   back where you started
get down   back into hell
your black soul, you know you're
black hearted
i smell your sulfurous smell
i was the boy who said all of my prayers
laid my clean face on the pillow
tucked in real tight, so safe and secure
through the night"
"i slipped into my jeans
lookin hard and feelin mean
i took a spit at the moon
it's all in this luney tune
just a little insane
a couple shots, i can't feel no pain
hey, where have i been?
and who are these scary men?
is this all real?
is this all necessary?
or it this a joke?
many know i don't regret at all
they locked me up for good
pinned me against the wall
i can't find the exit
i quit lookin for doors
i stole a razor from the commissary
i just couldn't take it no more
i'm swimmin in blood
like a rat on a sewer floor
no longer insane
just part of this crazy dream"
"when i was a boy
i never played with toys
never had a friend
never laughed or cried much
and when i was a boy
my father was a man
with a strict and sturdy hand
no soft touch
make that money, make that money
make that money run like honey
on your tongue
gotta make that money
make that money, listen sonny
learn to sting before your stung
now that i'm a man
every penny has been planned
i'm financially grand
and perfectly greedy
sentimental fools
i make all your rules
i've got your cash, got your jewels
they're all mortgaged to me
make that money, make that money
make that money run like honey
on your tongue
gotta make that money
make that money, listen sonny
learn to sting before your stung
and i know
'cause he told me so
told me so i believe him
i still believe...
give me that money
controlling all your cash
i could make you live in trash
i eat pheasant, you eat hash
no philanthropy
but when it's time for me to croak
bury me with all my dough
and where there should've been an oak
my private money tree will grow
make that money
said make that money
make that money run like honey
on your tongue
told me so
told me so
he told me so"
"i wake up every morning, six o'clock, i`m right on time

i never lose anything, my car keys or my hat
'cause i`m the man of the year
i`m the man of the year
i never cheat at finals, or miss a day at school
my urine tests are perfect, my prostate is a jewel
'cause i`m the man of the year
i`m the man of the year
'cause i`m the man of the year
i`m never, ever jealous
never, ever cruel
i`m a graduate of harvard
where i never broke the rules
the queen made me a knight
the pope made me a saint
the president plays golf with me
i make madonna faint
so why am i so lonely
depressed and in despair
if i pull this trigger in my mouth will anybody care
it was the greatest funeral, i laid in perfect state
and later i will meet the lord, i bet he just can`t wait
to meet the man of the year
i`m the man of the year
stand in line to meet the man
i`m the man, i`m the man, i`m the man"

you told me you were better off alone

lookin' down at all the cars
i can see you
in the window of your favorite corner bar
but to reach you is just too far
and i might as well be on mars
the city seems so old and grey and beat
it closes in and makes me wanna suffocate
and you just live across the street
but that's a billion miles away
you've turned my world into a dark and lonely place
like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'
i'd cross the universe to be right where you are
but i'm right in your backyard

and yet so far
baby, i might as well be on mars
baby, i can't fly
if i could i'd come down to ya
maybe i should try

"if i should find myself in blackest night,
and fear is stabbin' me all over,
a tiny prayer cracks the dark with light,
and i here sounds behind my wall.
inside, a still small voice, it calls and calls.
then like a thunder bolt it falls and falls:
my god!
when life becomes more real than children's games,
or we've become too old to play them,
we'll grow old gracefully,
we'll hide our shame. but there's that voice behind the wall.
and like my conscience, it is still and small.
each word is mercy, protects us all:
my god!
""et in lux perpetuo""
""deu domine""
""et in pax aeternus""
""deu domine""
i was a boy, when tempted, fell sometimes,
and fell so low, no one could see me,
save for the eyes of him that sees my crime.
when sheep, like me, have drifted lost,
all frightened children who are tempest tossed,
down flies his wrath like an albatross:
my god!"

"i got a job in atlanta in a mall playing santa
not because of any talent but because i was the
only one the suit would fit
everybody shopping, little sticky kids were hopping
on my lap with their fingers in my beard,
i guess they thought that i was really it
she sat down on my lap and said to me
""i'm twenty three and i need someone
you look like someone who could play with me
stay with me, all day with me""
'cause i'm in no man's land
can't seem to find a real man
you know i'm lookin' for a steel man
she said i'm in no man's land
i'm gonna show you a real good time
i'd gladly pay you double overtime
she was beggin' to be mine, but my job was on the line
should i say or should i go? i just didn't know
...hmmmm
i left fifty kids standin' in line, they were whining, they were crying
and their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and i swear
i never heard such profanity
i dropped my suit on the floor,
they were trying to block the door
they were calling her a whore
they were driven to nativital insanity
we drove away in her mercedes benz,
dirty blond split ends in the breeze
she said ""i want to put you under my tree
you're just a little gift from me to me""
'cause i'm in no man's land
can't seem to find a real man
you know i'm lookin' for a steel man
she said i'm in no man's land
you know i'm ready for a real good time
i'd gladly pay you double overtime
she had money all her life
she wasn't lookin' to become my wife
she said, ""i hope you understand,
i just want a nightful of man, sonny""
she didn't notice i was thin with a delicate chin
nor the softness of my skin, nor the scent of my other personalities
she didn't see through my disguise   didn't see it in my eyes
she was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality
she said ""come and lay down on the floor with me
it's warmer here by the fire""
she didn't know that there was more of me
she'd have to learn to love all four of me
'cause i'm in no man's land
i'm lookin' for the real me

you know i'm in no man's land

i see rozetta day by day
she turns my head makes me cough
i want to tear my collar off
i just can't sleep at night

she's got the devil's light
shining in her eyes
screamed my sermon damning sin and vice
when underneath i was a regular guy
my pulpit melted like a block of ice
when a bolt of lightning hit me from the sky
from my stretcher when they wheeled me in
i stared directly in the eyes of sin
nurse rozetta standing over me
and i was helpless as a man of god could be
nurse rozetta i won't let her
catch me peering down her sweater
fantasizing silk suspenders on her thighs
nurse rozetta make me better
secretly my eyes undress her
let me feel your tongue depressor
i'm suddenly twice my size
my pants are all wet inside
she's so creative with a bar of soap
and so inventive with a stethoscope
to check my pulse she gotta hold my hand
i blow the fuse on the encephalogram
satan sent her from the bowels of hell
i should have recognized old jezbel
i surrendered to the urges felt
she popped the buckle on my bible belt
i just can't sleep at night

she's got the devil's light
shining in her eyes
i'd lick her nylon seams
like a hungry cat with cream

here's some mud made of blood

the hand of a friend

put them back together again

follow the smoke going higher and higher
pick up the bones
and wish them goodnight
pray them a prayer and turn out the light

where the kitchen once stood
there are ribs in the fireplace
mixed with the wood
there are forces in the air
ghosts in the wind
some bullets in the back
and some scars on the skin
there were demons with guns
who marched through this place
killing everything that breathed
they're an inhuman race
there are holes in the walls
bloody hair on the bricks
and the smell of this hell
is making me sick
pick up the bones
and set them on fire

you're trapped, alone, you're scared
we cut to you, we move in close
you're catatonic
you get a close up there

here's what we got

and tears your nightgown lace
you see a can, it's aerosol
you grab the hair spray
and light it in his face
there's a very hungry man in the cellar
oh, waiting
or is he in the attic closet
waiting
debbie? i like this game.
debbie?
debbie? debbie? debbie?
he blindly grabs you
tries to stab you
but you're quicker
you over act right here
you see a cat, a ball of yarn
a knitting needle
his vision's still not clear
he's stumbling 'round
don't make a sound
and then he grabs you
""hide and seek, my dear?""
he shifts his glance
you see your chance
you grab the needle and you
you plunge it in his ear
there's a very hungry man in the cellar
oh, waiting
or is he in the attic closet
waiting
there's a very hungry man in the cellar
oh, waiting
or is he in the attic closet
waiting

in ""halloween""
you think it's all over
and you're gazing into space
but you got to make sure
you hear something, you start to turn
and you're standing there frozen
staring him face to face
and he looks at you and says
""tag, you're it, sweetie
bye, debbie. debbie, debbie, debbie.
goodbye, debbie..."""

"leaving lepidoptera...please, don't touch the display,
little boy, aha cute! moving to the next aisle we have
arachnida, the spiders, our...finest collection.
this friendly little devil is the heptothilidi,
unfortunately harmless. next to him, the nasty licosa
raptoria, his tiny fangs cause creeping ulcerations of
the skin . and here, my prize, the black
widow. isn't she lovely?...and so deadly. her kiss is
fifteen times as poisonous as that of the rattlesnake.
you see her venom is highly neurotoxic, which is to say
that it attacks the central nervous system causing
intense pain, profuse sweating, difficulty in
breathing, loss of consciousness, violent convulsions
and, finally...death. you know what i think i love the
most about her is her inborn need to dominate,
possess. in fact, immediately after the consummation
of her marriage to the smaller and weaker male of the
species she kills and eats him... oh, she is
delicious...and i hope he was! such power and dignity
...unhampered by sentiment. if i may put forward a
slice of personal philosophy, i feel that man has ruled
this world as a stumbling dimented child king long
enough! and as his empire crumbles, my precious black
widow shall rise as his most fitting successor!
these words he speaks are true
we're all humanary stew if
we don't pledge allegiance to
the black widow
the horror that he brings
the horror of his sting
the unholiest of kings
the black widow
our minds will be his toy
and every girl and boy will learn to be employed by
the black widow
love me
yes we love me
love him
yes we love him
love me
yes we love him
he sits upon his throne and picks at all the bones of his
husbands and his
wives he's devoured
he stares with a gleam
with a laugh so obscene at the virgins and the children
he's deflowered
love me
yes we love me
love him
yes we love him
love me
yes we love him
love me
yes we love him
our thoughts are hot and crazed
our brains are webbed in haze
of mindless senseless daze
the black widow
these words he speaks are true
we're all humanary stew
if we don't pledge allegiance to
the black widow"

your nightgown on the stairs

scenes from home in the quiet room
how long have i been gone
did winter kill the lawn
and all those polaroids you sent
are on the wall in the quiet room
they've got this place
where they've been keeping me
where i can't hurt myself
i can't get my wrists to bleed
just don't know why
suicide appeals to me
the quiet room
is sterilized and white
it's like a tomb
with just a moth stained naked night
plastic forks and spoon
no laces in my shoes
they all know what i tried to do
outside the quiet room
this quiet place
it ain't so new to me
it's haunted atmosphere
has heard so many scream
my home from home
my twilight zone
my strangest dream
my confidant
i have confessed my life
the quiet room
knows more about me than my wife
they've got this place
where they've been keeping me

"wrote a song, it was wrong from it`s very first conception
seemed i struggled on every line
it wasn`t fast, wasn`t pretty, wasn`t serious or witty
the song that didn`t rhyme
the band couldn`t wing it, the singer couldn`t sing it
the drummer's always out of time
the dj`s were offended, my union card suspended
billboard declared it a crime
the melody blows in a key that no one can find
the lyrics don`t flow but i can`t get it out of my mind
a three minute waste of your time
on a song that didn`t rhyme
it was bland, it was boring, all the groupies there were snoring
the first time we played it live
all the record guys got fired, the president retired
but somehow the song survived
the melody blows in a key that no one can find
the lyrics don`t flow but i can`t get it out of my mind
the melody blows in a key that no one can find
the lyrics don`t flow but i can`t get it out of my mind

"i was sitting in my room, dark and gray and crying
someone in my life i fear was at the point of dying
a cold wind blew right up my spine, it was the break of dawn
a little voice went deep inside told me she was gone
oh... this house is haunted
oh... that's how i want it to be
oh... this house is haunted
you can always stay here with me...
no more singing, no more laughing, no more sunny days
she left and took the colours with her, buried in her grave
this is where we climbed the tower, this is where she fell
then when her young heart stopped beating, i went to hell
oh... this house is haunted
oh... ha....
oh... this house is haunted

you float through the lining room, i watch my tv
i feel you sit down on the couch right here next to me
then i feel you lips touch mine just like we used to do
i'm so happy all alone being here with you..."

shiny white halls
drawing rats on the wall

chained in a cell
got my own private hell

never just a little boy
