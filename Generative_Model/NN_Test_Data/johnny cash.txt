"the other night dear, as i lay sleeping
i dreamed i held you in my arms
but when i awoke, dear, i was mistaken
so i bowed my head and i cried
you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are grey
you'll never know, dear, how much i love you
please don't take my sunshine away
i've always loved you and made you happy,
and nothing else could come between.
but now you've left me to love another;
you have shattered all of my dreams
you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are grey
you'll never know, dear, how much i love you
please don't take my sunshine away"
"i hurt myself today
to see if i still feel
i focus on the pain
the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but i remember everything
what have i become
my sweetest friend?
everyone i know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all:
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt
i wear this crown of thorns
upon my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts
i cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feelings disappear
you are someone else
i am still right here
what have i become
my sweetest friend?
everyone i know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all:
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt
if i could start again
a million miles away
i would keep myself
i would find a way"

"an old cowpoke went ridin' out one dark and windy day,
upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
when all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
come rushin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw.
their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath you could feel
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
he saw the riders coming hard... and he heard their mournful cry
yipie i oh yipie i ay
ghost riders in the sky.
their face is gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked
with sweat
they're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they 'aint caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever in the range up in the sky
on horses snorting fire as they ride hard hear them cry
the riders leaned on by him he heard one call his name
if you want to save your soul from hell a riding on our range
then cow   boy change your ways today or with us you will ride
tryin' to catch this devil herd... a   cross these endless
skies.
yipie i oh yipie i ay
ghost riders in the sky.
ghost riders in the sky.
ghost riders in the sky."
"i hear the train a comin'
it's rolling round the bend
and i ain't seen the sunshine since i don't know when,
i'm stuck in folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
but that train keeps a rollin' on down to san anton..
when i was just a baby my mama told me. son,
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
but i shot a man in reno just to watch him die
when i hear that whistle blowing i hang my head and cry..
i bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probally drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigarrs.
well i know i had it coming, i know i can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me...
well if they'd free me from this prison,
if that railroad train was mine
i bet i'd move just a little further down the line
far from folsom prison is where i want to stay
and i'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away....."

he said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, i'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do
with a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, john henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a fay for driven steel,
i was born for driven steel

"hello i'm johnny cash
one night i had a backstage pass to the willie nelson show
there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
and athletes and movie stars and david allan coe
there was leather and lace and every minority race
with a backstage pass to the willie nelson show
kristofferson got an offer for a movie promoters closed another deal or two
waylon got a call from his son shooter and he went home the minute he was through
i moved with the mob at intermission
to the green room where you see who you can see
there were has been's and would be's and never were's
paupers punks and millionaires and me
and there were wackoes...
hells angels blocked the traffic to the building
in order for the beer truck to come through
and waitin' in the wings to sing with willie were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude
there was a singer willie knew back in the fifties
who once paid him fifty dollars for a song
there were women who once did and some who still would
i heard one ask did connie come along
and there were wackoes...
i wish you could've been there well maybe you were"
"my daddy left home when i was three
and he didn't leave much to ma and me
just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
now, i don't blame him cause he run and hid
but the meanest thing that he ever did
was before he left, he went and named me ""sue.""
well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
and it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk,
it seems i had to fight my whole life through.
some gal would giggle and i'd get red
and some guy'd laugh and i'd bust his head,
i tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""sue.""
well, i grew up quick and i grew up mean,
my fist got hard and my wits got keen,
i'd roam from town to town to hide my shame.
but i made a vow to the moon and stars
that i'd search the honky tonks and bars
and kill that man who gave me that awful name.
well, it was gatlinburg in mid july
and i just hit town and my throat was dry,
i thought i'd stop and have myself a brew.
at an old saloon on a street of mud,
there at a table, dealing stud,
sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""sue.""
well, i knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn out picture that my mother'd had,
and i knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
he was big and bent and gray and old,
and i looked at him and my blood ran cold
and i said: ""my name is 'sue!' how do you do!
now your gonna die!!""
well, i hit him hard right between the eyes
and he went down, but to my surprise,
he come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.
but i busted a chair right across his teeth
and we crashed through the wall and into the street
kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer.
i tell ya, i've fought tougher men
but i really can't remember when,
he kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
i heard him laugh and then i heard him cuss,
he went for his gun and i pulled mine first,
he stood there lookin' at me and i saw him smile.
and he said: ""son, this world is rough
and if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
and i knew i wouldn't be there to help ya along.
so i give ya that name and i said goodbye
i knew you'd have to get tough or die
and it's the name that helped to make you strong.""
he said: ""now you just fought one hell of a fight
and i know you hate me, and you got the right
to kill me now, and i wouldn't blame you if you do.
but ya ought to thank me, before i die,
for the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
cause i'm the son of a b**** that named you ""sue.'""
i got all choked up and i threw down my gun
and i called him my pa, and he called me his son,
and i came away with a different point of view.
and i think about him, now and then,
every time i try and every time i win,
and if i ever have a son, i think i'm gonna name him
bill or george! anything but sue! i still hate that name!"
"country boy, ain't got no shoes

well, you work all day while you're waitin' to play in the sun and the sand, with a face that's tan
but at the end of the day, when your work is done
you ain't got nothin' but fun
country boy, you got a shaggy dog
country boy, up a hollow log
well, he comes in a run, when you pick up your gun
and with a shell or two, and your dog and you

"now don't laugh at the condition the lady's in
she soon could wear a cocktail dress again
but we get along without cocktails, mighty fine
this will be our first and i'm proud the baby is mine
yes, i married her although i knew the kind of life she used to live
and 'cause i knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
and if you just mind your own business we'd be fine
don't ever doubt i'm proud the baby is mine
she's awkward, yeah, but have you seen her face
where there once was shame there's a sparkle in it's place
and her conscience is clear that's why her eyes shine
mister don't ever doubt i'm proud the baby is mine
i married her although i knew the kind of life she used to live
and 'cause i knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
if you'd mind your own business we'd make it fine
tell all her old friends i'm proud the baby is mine"
"many, many years ago
when this land was young
a lot of our country was covered
by big tall beautiful trees
and men had to have the trees
to make wood, to build houses
make furniture with, to make boats
even to make paper with
so as more and more people came
more wood was needed
so more and more trees
were cut down
and the man that lived in the forest
and cut down the trees
was called the timber man
well, my world is green and dark and dumb
my home is in the loggin' camp
all week i cut down the mighty trees
saturday i get to do as i please
i give the man more than his hire
and he'll never know it if i tire
show me the toughest tree around
the timber man will bring it down
swing it hard, cut it clean
no halfway or in between
move when the axe is in my hand
make way for the timber man
yeah, he was a mighty big tough man usually
that timber man that lived in that forest
and cut down those big trees
well, they say there's sawdust in my brain
and don't get caught out in the rain
i got stump water in my blood
the sweat from my brow turns the ground to mud
when the men don't know how to fell a tree
the one they'll come and ask is me
i'll mark my spot and i'll take my stand
the tree's gonna fall for the timber man
swing it hard, cut it clean
no halfway or in between
move when the axe is in my hand
make way for the timber man
and when they're cuttin' on a tree
and it's just about ready to fall
the man yells out timber, timber"
"buck in 1899 everybody sang auld lang syne
a hundred years would take a long long time for every boy and girl

i swear it was there just a minute ago all over this world
all over this world all over this world
the 20th century is almost over almost over almost over
the 20th century is almost over all over the world
does anyone recall the great depression i read all about it in the true confession
sorry i was late for the recording session but somebody put me on hold

they went around in revolving doors all over this world
all over this world...
old father time is a rumblin' and a rappin'
standin' at the window thumpin' and a tappin'
everybody's waitin' for somethin' to happen hope it don't happen to you
you know the judgement day is gettin' nearer there it is in the rear view mirror
if you duck down i could see a little clearer all over this world
all over this world...
all over this world...

"with the campbells and mcdonalds, it was in their blood to fight
with each passing generation it became a mans birthright
but they always had a common enemy
never would the english crown take scottish independency
oh the battles rage in glasgow and majestic edinburgh
and they came with war machines and in the highlands shots were heard
then the people rose in union and the forces moved as one
and the clans all joined together to see english on the run
and in a tiny croft in clachan sat a mother, peg macdunn
and she sewed the cords together for her 16 year old son
and she cried as he was leaving, donâ
and come you back to clachan when the english are all done
now rob macdunn was ready as the left the croft behind
and he joined the highland pipe brigade with one thing on his mind
that to keep his home and freedom he must face it like a man
so he marched in common union with his musket in his hand
and he met the hill of battle in the highlands and the low
and the reason for the fighting long within his blood to know
in the middle of the rumble he was forward gaining ground
and the bagpipes still were playing as the dead lay all around
then he moved in no direction till he faced the winds of north
and he boldly climbed the highlands, further from the firth of forth
then one freezing, blowing morning, came the cry of peg macdunn
back to my croft in clachan god has sent me home my son
and in another croft in clachan cross the way from the macdunnâ
with her face against the window sat a young girl, tired and worn
and she smiled a secret knowing as she breathed a prayer alone
i thank thee lord for bringing rob macdunn back safely home
back to the croft in clachan, he returned to peace again
he had gone a boy of 16, but he came back as a man."
"if heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game,
i'd be a legend in my time.
if they gave gold statuettes for tears and regrets,
i'd be a legend in my time.
but they don't give awards, and there's no praise or fame
for hearts that are broken for love that's in vain.
if loneliness meant world acclaim,
everyone would know my name
i'd be a legend in my time."
"stop lovin' me a little at a time,
let me lose you a little at a time
walk away slow like you don't want to go,
leave me a little at a time
for my benefit try to cry a little bit
for old times sake give me a slow heartbreak
i put up a fight but i'll be all right
if you stop lovin' me a little at a time
hurt me a little at a time, turn me away a little at a time
walk away slow like you don't want to go leave me,
a little at a time
for my benefit try to cry a little bit
a little at a time, a little at a time, a little at a time"
"how many times have
you heard someone say
if i had his money
i could do things my way
but little they know
that it´s so hard to find
one rich man in ten
with a satisfied mind
once i was waitin´
in fortune and fame
everything that i dreamed for
to get a start in life´s game
then suddenly it happened
i lost every dime
but i´m richer by far
with a satisfied mind
money can´t buy back
your youth when you´re old
or a friend when you´re lonely
or a love that´s grown cold
the wealthiest person
is a pauper at times
compared to the man
with a satisfied mind
when my life has ended
and my time has run out
my friends and my loved ones
i´ll leave there´s no doubt
but one thing´s for certain
when it comes my time
i´ll leave this old world
with a satisfied mind
how many times have
you heard someone say
if i had his money
i could do things my way
but little they know
that it´s so hard to find
one rich man in ten
with a satisfied mind"
"i don't drink the way that i use to
later that just think my style
and the hard times don't hurt like
they wants dead
they pass more quickly like wanna i was wire

to the sound like the sun going down
and the magic,the morning this bringing ..."
"six foot six stood on the ground, weighted 235 pounds
but i saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
he was the kind of man who would gamble on love
look you in the eye and never back up
but i saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love
can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
like the rules that govern our land
strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called love
it can lift you up, it can put you down
take your world and turn it all around
ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love
men like me they worry and doubt
trouble their minds day in and day out
too busy with a livin' to worry about a little word like love
and then i see a mother's tenderness
as she holds her young close to her breast
then i say thank god this world will win with the thing called love"
"every town has its town bum i guess ours had one here's a song about him
i remember him fondly well his name was abner brown
i knew an old drunk named abner brown and nobody knew when he came to town
but he spread good will to his fellow men and they let him sleep in the cotton gin
he could drink more brew than an army could
but he had more friends and he did more good
than a lot of fine fancy people in our town so they tolerated abner brown
and all us kids were on his side cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide
and he made us feel bout ten feet tall cause he had no kids but he claimed us all
and after school and on weekends you could find me down at the cotton gin
the truest friend that i ever found was a good old drunk named abner brown
abner brown i wish that i could see you once again
i believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men
i've met and known in all the low and higher places that i've been
thinking of you picks me up when i'm feeling down
i thank the lord for making abner brown
lord take me back to the cotton land to arkansas take me home again
let me be the boy that i once have been let me walk that road to the cotton gin
he's probably dead many years ago and gone the way that old drunks go
but i'd still like to sit me down talk to my old friend abner brown
abner brown i wish...
i thank the lord for making abner brown"
"we have drifted apart
broken hearts, me and you
after all of this time
i'm satisfied inside to know
this memory that i had
it's more good than bad
you taught me how to sing
and bring you love
after all this time
you're still a friend of mine
so i believe in someone
after all
our love didn't last long
what went wrong?
who's to say?
if you never been by
how then could i
begin to say
after all this time
and you're still a friend of mine
so i believe in someone
after all
after all this time
you're still a friend of mine
so i believe in someone
after all"
"i feel so good come payday
i think of all the things i'm gonna buy when i pick up my pay
don't you know but then they hand me that little brown envelope
i peep inside lord i lose all hope
cause from those total wages earned down to that net amount that's due
i feel the painful sense of loss between the two
there goes that bracelet for her arm there goes that new fence for my farm
there goes that brand new pontiac there goes the shirt right off my back
you can dream about a honeymoon for two
you can dream but that's about all you can do
cause by the time old uncle sam gets through with you
you can buy her a pair of hose a little powder for her nose
and take her down to sloppy joe's for beer and stew them are the facts after tax
you can dream about vacation in the sun
you can dream but you can't never have you one
cause by the time your good old uncle sam gets done
you've got just enough for gas to see them city limits pass
and if you get back home fourth class i'd say you won
there goes that bracelet for her arm there goes that new fence for my farm
send back that short wave radio cancel that trip to mexico
forget that brand new pontiac there goes the shirt right off my back"
"i hear people laughin' on the corner by the square
the neon flickers on my wall and i know you're out there
i'm in your bed and listenin' for your footsteps down the hall
and i'll be waitin' for you after the ball
after the ball is over after the ball
if you cannot stand i've got a place for you to fall
the blinds're drawn and i have turned the clock face to the wall
i'll be waitin' for you after the ball
lovin' you is sweet addiction i need only you
just as long as you come back go do what you want to do
give the night your laughter but i'll have you after all
i'll be waitin' for you after the ball
after the ball is over...
after the ball is over...

my grandfather was a preacher a country preacher from carolina
yeah and i bet he made a lot of money too
he didn't make any money if he got anything it was earned
he did weddings funerals preached twice a week visited the sick everyday
he was a boyscout master a marriage counselor
a fighter and wild horse rider and a windmill operator
hey don't get funny hey how can you criticize preachers

and everyone of them's got some trash in their closet
there ain't no man that's all good
and no man is all bad either
my grandpa wasn't all talk like i said you know he served the people
he didn't ask for money because he knew them poor people out there didn't have it
he worked in the fields through the week to support himself side by side
with the people he preached to on sunday
i guess they believed him on sunday
because they knew they could believe in him on monday"
"i'd sing more about moral of this land but all god's children ain't free
i'd open up every door i can cause all god's children ain't free
i met a beaten broken man he shovels dirt but got no land
and he held out his hand to me all god's children ain't free
i'd sing along too a silly song but all god's children ain't free
i'm gonna sing the blues for the men they done wrong
cause all god's children ain't free
mister how bout the man you condemn to die
but taking everything that he's livin' by
and reject him from society all god's children ain't free
no reject him from society all god's children ain't free
i'd be happy walking any street but all god's children ain't free
i'd have a smile for all i meet but all god's children ain't free
i'd whistle down the road but i wouldn't feel right
i'd hear somebody cryin' out at night
from a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all god's children ain't free
from a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all god's children ain't free"
"well i asked an old truckdriver about life out on the road
if he does a lotta singing when he's bringing in his load
if there's a pretty waitress crying for him every hundred miles
if he gets a lotta loving if he has a lot of smiles
and i asked him if those trucking songs tell about a life like his
he said if you want to know the truth about it here's the way it is
all i do is drive drive drive try to stay alive
and keep my mind on my load keep my eye upon the road
i got nothin' in common with any man who's home every day at five
all i do is drive drive drive drive drive drive
well we shared a cup of coffee then i had to warm it up
and his greasy fingers trembled as he held onto the cup
and i said don't you hear a lot of music see a lot of sights
but if you'll tune into the grand ole opry saturday night
i will dedicate you a trucking song to which you can relate
he said you just do the singing and i'll do the driving mate
all i do is drive drive drive...
if i can get the fuel fuel"
"every time i look at you i fall in love, all over again
every time i think of you it all begins, all over again
one little dream at night and i can dream all day
it only takes a memory to thrill me
one little kiss from you and i just fly away
pour me out your love until you fill me
i wanna fall in love beginning from the start, all over again
show me how you stole away my heart, all over again
one little dream at night and i can dream all day
it only takes a memory to thrill me
one little kiss from you and i just fly away
pour me out your love until you fill me
i wanna fall in love beginning from the start, all over again

"always alone alone and blue
i've got no one to tell my troubles to
no one to care to call my own
it seems that i must always be alone
the day you left you broke my heart
i need you so but we're so far apart
you didn't care i should have known
that you would go and leave me all alone
there is no one to take your place
each night in dreams i see your smiling face
then i awake and find you gone
i know that i must always be alone"
"amazing grace!
how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost, but now am found
was blind, but now i see
'twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace appear
the hour i first believed
the lord has promised good to me
his word my hope secures
he will my shield and portion be
as long as life endures
yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail
and mortal life shall cease
i shall posess within the veil
a life of joy and peace
when we've been there ten thousand years
bright shining as the sun
we've no less days to sing god's praise
than when we've first begun"

and this time honey you've burned all your bridges
you're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine

"there was a man whose deeds were dark as night
and quite by chance he rode into the light
a man wild as the dust devil with no place to run livin' by his wits and by his gun
he met a girl like none he had ever known she cared not for the wild oats he had sown
and so he laid his gun down and set his spirit free began living in respectability
but his old ways of thinkin' wouldn't die could not forget the old creed he lived by
and the good and bad and right and wrong kept fightin' for his soul
till his heart and mind both went out of control
but now the old saloon had lost its spell what once was laughter now was living hell
and the hookers guns and drinkin' in his life were out of place
and in his mind he saw an angel's face
so he burned all his bridges in a day and the devil deeds were done and laid away
and he rode out a better man than when he first rode in
and the angel got the badman in the end"

"do they ask you where i am or where i've been
do they ever say where is the lonely friend
is my name whispered in your bedside prayers
do you feel a vacant spot beside you there
well there's always one more path that i must walk
and there's people i should sit down with and talk
and somebody might appreciate the flowers i could bring
so there's always another song to sing
do you tell them i was wilder than the wind
do you remember that i needed lots of friends
and at other times i'd rather be alon
where i could not be found when i was gone
well there's always one more canyon to explore
to touch the things left by those gone before
at the top of the tiniest hill i can feel like i'm a king
and there's always another song to sing"

i've made quite a name for myself the girls know who i am
i'm a natural actual real authentical arkansas lovin' man yes i am
now in every little town that i've been in the story is the same
the girls all keep on a hangin' around playin' them lovin' games
but sometimes i wish them women folks would leave this old boy alone
i've thought about catchin' that next greyhound back to my arkansas home
but there ain't no use in kiddin' myself i like the way i am
i'm a natural actual real authentical arkansas lovin' man
oh yes i am
now you look here woman that look in your eyes says maybe you love me so
but if you turn loose of my coatail i'll get my bedroll and go

"alas and did saviour bleed and did my sov'reign die
would he devote that sacred head for such a worm as i
at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light

was it for crimes that i have done he groaned upon the tree
amazing pity grace unknown and love beyond degree

"they had a warrant out for me all over the country
and i was trying to beat the raps in idaho
i was breaking into a schoolhouse sunday morning without warning
when i saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below
his steel grey eyes were blazing when he saw me
his hand was on his gun when he rode up
he said you killed that woman i know you shot her why'd you do it
i'm taking you to austin then i'm gonna lock you up
well he tied me with a plow line the next morning
and he had me deep in texas the next day
a crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of austin
but he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away
a jury found me guilty three months later twelve evil men with murder in their eyes
they even took me out and said now show us where you killed her
and that wicked judge said now i here by sentence you to die
but here i am far away from austin prison my friend the jailer handed me a file
now all i want between me and there are a lot of friendly people
and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles"

"there's a story in our town
of the prettiest girl around
golden hair and eyes of blue
how those eyes could flash at you
boys hung 'round her by the score
but she loved the boy next door who worked at the
candy store
she was tops in all they said
it never once went to her head
she had everything it seems
not a care, this teenage queen
other boys could offer more
but she loved the boy next door who worked at the
candy store
(dream on, dream on teenage queen you should be a
movie queen)
he would marry her next spring
saved his money, bought a ring
then one day a movie scout
came to town to take her out
hollywood could offer more
so she left the boy next door working at the candy
store
very soon she was a star
pretty house and shiny car
swimming pool and a fence around
but she missed her old home town
all the world was at her door
all except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
then one day the teenage star
sold her house and all her cars
gave up all her wealth and fame
left it all and caught a train
do i have to tell you more
she came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store"
"in a southern town where i was born that's where i got my education
i worked in the fields and i walked in the woods and i wondered at creation
i recall the sun in the skies of blue and the smell of green things growin'
and i lived everyday and i lived anyway anyway the wind was blowin'
but then i heard of a cultured city life breath taking lofty steeples
and the day i called myself a man i left my land and my people
and i rambled north and i rambled east and i tested and i tasted
and a girl or two took me around and around but always left me wasted
in the world that's all concrete and steel with nothin' green ever growin'
where the buildings hide the risin' sun and stop the free wind from blowin'
where they sleep all day and they wake all night to a world of drink and laughter
i met that girl that i thought would be the one that i was after
in a soft blue gown and a formal tux beneath that lofty steeple
he said do you barbara take this man will you be one of his people
and she said i will and she said i do and the world looked mighty pretty
and we lived in a fancy downtown flat cause she loved the noisy city
then the days grew cold beneath the yellow sky and i longed for green things growin'
and i talked of home and my people there but she'd not agreed a goin'
then her hazel eyes turned away from me with the look that wasn't very pretty
and she turned into concrete and steel and she said i'll take the city
now the cars go by on the interstate and my pack is on my shoulder
and i'm goin' home where i belong much wiser now and older"
"here lies less more four slugs from a forty four no less no more
out in arizona just south of tucson
where tumbleweeds tumble in search of a home
there's a town they call tombstone where the brave never cry
they live by a sixgun by a sixgun they die
it's been a long time now since the town was a boom
the jailhouse is empty so's the palace saloon
just one look will tell you that this town was real
a secluded old dirt road leads up to boot hill
walk up to the fence there and look at the view
that's where they were hanging eighteen eighty two
it's easy to see where the brave men have died
rope marks on the oak tree are now petrified
at night when the moon shines so far away
it gets mighty lonesome lookin' down on their graves
there lies billy clanton never wanted to kill
but he's there with the guilty way up on boot hill "
"ira hayes,
ira hayes
chorus:
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
gather round me people there's a story i would tell
about a brave young indian you should remember well
from the land of the pima indian
a proud and noble band
who farmed the phoenix valley in arizona land
down the ditches for a thousand years
the water grew ira's peoples' crops
'till the white man stole the water rights
and the sparklin' water stopped
now ira's folks were hungry
and their land grew crops of weeds
when war came, ira volunteered
and forgot the white man's greed
chorus:
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
there they battled up iwo jima's hill,
two hundred and fifty men
but only twenty seven lived to walk back down again
and when the fight was over
and when old glory raised
among the men who held it high
was the indian, ira hayes
chorus:
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
ira returned a hero
celebrated through the land
he was wined and speeched and honored; everybody shook his hand
but he was just a pima indian
no water, no crops, no chance
at home nobody cared what ira'd done
and when did the indians dance
chorus:
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
then ira started drinkin' hard;
jail was often his home
they'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone!
he died drunk one mornin'
alone in the land he fought to save
two inches of water in a lonely ditch
was a grave for ira hayes
chorus:
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
yeah, call him drunken ira hayes
but his land is just as dry
and his ghost is lyin' thirsty
in the ditch where ira died"

just a little ways with me
and as we walked and we would talk
all about our weddingday
and only say that you'll be mine
in no others arms entwined
down beside where the waters flow
on the banks of the ohio
i asked her if she'd marry me
and my wife forever be
she only turned her head away
and had no other words to say
i plunged a knife into her breast
and told her she was going to rest
she cried ""oh willy, don't murder me
i'm not prepared for eternity.""
i took her by her golden curls
i drug her down to the river side
an i there threw her into drown

long before i was here

in my bed or in my beer
there were songs before there was radio
of love that stays and love that goes
they were writing meloncholy tunes
and tearful words that rhyme
before my time
before my time
there were songs in old dusty books
of love thats always been
sweet lovers in their glory
who are now gone with the wind
old fashion love words spoken then
keep coming back around again
nothings changed except the names
their love burns just like mine
before my time
before my time
and in the dim of yesterday
i can clearly see
that flesh and blood cried out to someone
as it does in me
and there was some old song that said
i love you 'til i die
before my time
before my time
but what the old time masters had
is what i feel for you
love is love and doesn't change
in a century or two
if someway they had seen and knew
how it would be for me and you
they'd wish for love like yours
and they would wish for love like mine
before my time

around the city he built a wall and declared that babylon would never fall
he had concubines and wives he called his babylon paradise
on his throne he drank and ate but for belshazah it was gettin' late
for he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
his kingdom was divided couldn't stand
he was weighed in the balance and found
wanting his houses were built upon the sand
well the people feasted and drank their wine and praised the false gods of his time
all holy things they scorned and mocked but suddenly all their mocking stopped
for on the wall there appeared a hand nothing else there was no man
in blood the hand began to write and belshazah couldn't hide his fright
for he was weighed in the balance and found
wanting his houses were built upon the sand
well no one around could understand what was written by the mystic hand
belshazah tried but couldn't find a man who could give him peace of mind
but daniel the prophet a man of god he saw the writing on the wall in blood
belshazah asked him what it said and daniel turned to the wall and read
my friend you're weighed in the balance and found wanting
your kingdom is divided it can't stand
you're weighed in the balance and found
wanting your houses are built upon the sand"

you are the master of your destiny

you're the best friend that you've ever had
you're the best friend that you've ever had
so you laugh when it's time to laugh and you cry when it's time to cry
live while it's time to live cause you'll die when it's time to die hmm
then he closed his eyes and he left me alone
this old man's wisdom brought his meaning home
a diamond is a diamond...
well now that i'm older i found this is true
the thing that remains is the good that you do
a diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
but a man's not all good nor all bad
when the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
god is the best friend that you've ever had
god is the best friend that you've ever had

big john
every mornning at the mine, you could see him arrive.
he stood 6 foot 6, weighed 245.
kind of broad at the shoulders, narrow at the hip.
and everybody knew you didn't give no lip to big john.
big john
big john
big bad john
big john
nobody seemed to know where john called home
he just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
he didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy
and if you spoke at all, you'd just said hi to big john.
somebody said he came from new orleans,
where he got into a fight over a cajun queen.
and a crash and a blow from a huge right hand,
sent a lousiana fella to the promise land.

big john
big bad john

then came the day at the bottom of the mine,
when a timber cracked and men started crying.
minors were praying, and hearts beat fast
and everybody thought they had breathed thier last
cept' john.
through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell,
walked a giant of a man that the minors knew well.
grabbed a sagging timber and gave out with a groan,
and like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big john
big john
big john
big bad john
big john
and with all of his strength, he gave a mighty shove.
then a minor yelled out, 'theres a light up above!'.
and 20 men scrambled from a 'would be' grave
now theres only one left down there to save, big john.
with jacks and timbers, they started back down,
then came that rumble way down in the ground.
and as smoke and gas smelched out of that mine,
everybody knew it was the end of the line, for big john.
big john
big john
big bad john
big john
now they never re opend that wortheless pit,
they just placed a marble stand in front of it.
these few words are written on that stand,
'at the bottom of this mine, lies one hell of a man, big john'

"i think sir the battle is over and the young soldier laid down his gun
i'm tired of running for cover i'm certain the bottle is done
for see over there where we fought them it's quiet for they've all gone away
all left is the dead and the dying the blue laying long side the gray
so you think the battle is over and you even lay down your gun
you carelessly rise from your cover for you think the battle is done
now boy hit the dirt listen to me for i'm still the one in command
get flat on the ground here beside me and lay your ear hard to the sand
can you hear the deafening rumble can you feel the trembling ground
it's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound
for every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life
there lies your friend jim mckenney can you take the news to his wife
no son the battle's not over the battle has only begun
the rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun
the fight yet to come's not with cannon nor will the fight be hand to hand
no one will regroup the forces no charge will a general command
the battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife
brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives
now go ahead rise from your cover be thankful that god let you live
go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give
i see sir the battle's not over the battle has only begun
the rest of the battle will cover this part that has blackened the sun
for though there's no sound of the cannon and though there's no smoke in the sky
i'm dropping the gun and the sabre and ready for battle am i"
"big foot was an indian chief of the miniconioux band
a band of miniconioux sioux from south dakota land
big foot said to custer stay away from crazy horse
but custer crossed into sioux land and he never came back across
then big foot led his people to a place called wounded knee
and they found themselves surrounded by the 7th calvary
big chief big foot rise up from your bed
miniconioux babies cry for their mothers lying dead
big foot was down with the fever when he reached wounded knee
and his people all were prisoners of the 7th calvary
two hundred women and children and another hundred men
raised up a white flag of peace but peace did not begin
an accidental gunshot and big foot was first to die
and over the noise of the rifles you could hear the babies cry
big chief big foot it's good that you can't see
revenge is being robbed by custer's 7th calvary
then smoke hung over the canyon on the cold december day
all was dead and dying around where big foot lay
farther on up in the canyon some had tried to run and hide
but death showed no favors women men and children died
one side called that masacre the other a victory
but the white flag is still waving today at wounded knee

"born to lose, i've lived my life in vain
every dream has only brought me pain
all my life, i've always been so blue
born to lose, and now i'm losing you
born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
how i long to always have you near
you've grown tired, and now you say we're thru
born to lose, and now i'm losing you
born to lose, my every hope is gone
it's so hard to face an empty dawn
you were all the happiness i knew
born to lose, and now i'm losing you
there's no use to dream of happiness
all i see is only loneliness
all my life, i've always been so blue
born to lose, and now i'm losing you"
"i was born in west virginia
where the land is black with coal
for a man to feed his family takes twelve hours a day
a diggin' in the big black hole
way down in the bottom of a mountain way
down in the bottom of a hole
way down in the bottom of a mountain i'm diggin'
and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal
some men give their wives jewelry
some men give their wives gold
but all i can give to my sweet woman
are the few dollars i make a diggin' out the dirty black coal
way down in the bottom of a mountain way
down in the bottom of a hole
way down in the bottom of a mountain i'm diggin'
and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal
i draw script for most of my money
i never see a lot of that
i work all week and go to church on sunday

"my daddy left home when i was three
and he didn't leave much to ma and me
just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
now, i don't blame him cause he run and hid
but the meanest thing that he ever did
was before he left, he went and named me ""sue.""
well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
and it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk,
it seems i had to fight my whole life through.
some gal would giggle and i'd get red
and some guy'd laugh and i'd bust his head,
i tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""sue.""
well, i grew up quick and i grew up mean,
my fist got hard and my wits got keen,
i'd roam from town to town to hide my shame.
but i made a vow to the moon and stars
that i'd search the honky tonks and bars
and kill that man who gave me that awful name.
well, it was gatlinburg in mid july
and i just hit town and my throat was dry,
i thought i'd stop and have myself a brew.
at an old saloon on a street of mud,
there at a table, dealing stud,
sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""sue.""
well, i knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn out picture that my mother'd had,
and i knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
he was big and bent and gray and old,
and i looked at him and my blood ran cold
and i said: ""my name is 'sue!' how do you do!?
now your gonna die!!""
well, i hit him hard right between the eyes
and he went down, but to my surprise,
he come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.
but i busted a chair right across his teeth
and we crashed through the wall and into the street
kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer.
i tell ya, i've fought tougher men
but i really can't remember when,
he kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
i heard him laugh and then i heard him cuss,
he went for his gun and i pulled mine first,
he stood there lookin' at me and i saw him smile.
and he said: ""son, this world is rough
and if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
and i knew i wouldn't be there to help ya along.
so i give ya that name and i said goodbye
i knew you'd have to get tough or die
and it's the name that helped to make you strong.""
he said: ""now you just fought one hell of a fight
and i know you hate me, and you got the right
to kill me now, and i wouldn't blame you if you do.
but ya ought to thank me, before i die,
for the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
cause i'm the son of a ***** that named you ""sue.'""
i got all choked up and i threw down my gun
and i called him my pa, and he called me his son,
and i came away with a different point of view.
and i think about him, now and then,
every time i try and every time i win,
and if i ever have a son, i think i'm gonna name him
bill or george! anything but sue! i still hate that name!"
"baby you're tired i can see in your eyes i know how you feel
we've been together too long to conceal
what's in you hearts maybe we should part but after so many years
that would only bring loneliness sorrow and tears and anyway
i never could never would never will ever kill what's between us
so let's try again we'll start a brand new dance between old friends
there will always be days when it don't seem to pay when it just doesn't rhyme
well let's bound to happen some of the time
our best days ain't gone we don't need to move on well maybe we could try
but i don't think you can make it and neither could i and anyway
i never could...

and let me tell you my darling it's a feeling i know

cause loving you ain't too hard to arrange and anyway
i never could..."
"when youâ€™re weary,
feeling small
when tears are in your eyes,
i will dry them all
iâ€™m on your side
when times get rough
and friends just canâ€™t be found

i will lay me down
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down

when youâ€™re on the street
when evening falls so hard
i will comfort you
iâ€™ll take your part
when darkness comes
and pain is all around

i will lay me down
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down

"got a song about the sister waitin' somewhere by the phone
for some man who never missed her ever since he come and gone
ain't it's harder for a woman with a baby on her way
that's the price of being human when you're poor enough to pay
and she listen to the freedom in the silence at her door
no one missin' when you need 'em there ain't no fun to sing that song no more
got a song about a saviour looking lonesome and afraid
at a city full of strangers and a cross he never made
and he's sadder than he's wiser and a longer way from home
and he wonders why his father left him bleeding and alone
just a broken song of freedom and the closing of a door
no one's missin' till you need 'em there ain't no fun to sing that song no more
just a broken song..."
"well first you gotta wanna get off bad enough to wanna get on him in the first place
and you better trust in your lady luck

one hand hold is all you got it's you and the bull against the clock and a cross crowd
and once upon a spinnin' ton nothin' else you've ever done can pull this way
you're just outside the buckin' shoot
lose a spur you lose your seat and you lose yourself
by now he's buckin' mean and dirty
slingin' mud and cowboy boots and kickin' clowns
no fools no fun bull rider
you gotta feel the way he's movin' you gotta watch his head
and brace yourself for anything that a friend of you might dead
you know the art of hangin' loose hangin' just as tight
well there's something like a hurricane who's dancin' with the kite
well the rodeo is more than rough
it's a fact of life it's tough to cut his fever ass
it's drinkin' beer and pullin' trailers
tighten may on barreled razors and horse's buck
no rides no pay bull rider live fast die young bull rider bull rider bull rider"

it's a long way to new orleans

you never know what round the next bend
or what we're gonna find either
do you know what i just wonder how long a man has to look before he finds himself
**********
i just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out
cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about
and a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low
so since i've gotta button up i believe i'll hit the road and go
country road 6 40 state highway 45 life out of the interstate is very much alive
there's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
and my song ain't through playin' yet so i believe i'll hit the road and go"
"a little girl woke up deep in the dark and started cryin'
the mother brought a light and held her daughter tight
she thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine
cry call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
her mother wiped the tears and said see honey you're only dreaming
your dad must work today he has to draw his pay
she left her then but still could hear her cry time after time
call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble
and fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground
the little girl was fast asleep yet cried out one more time
call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground
a dying man was found had survived all those around
he'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time
when he heard his own child whine call daddy from the mine
call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine"
"bayou bayou bayou bayou
now here's a little tale about a flock of geese
lookin' for a home and lookin' for a peace
but before they're safely in the southern sand

headin' on south at the call of the wild

"when you get a chance
would you please call your mother
and thank her for the good years that we had?
gently break the news that you don't love me
and give my best regards to your good old dad
i always liked your family
we got along just splendidly
though your brother
kind of rubbed me the wrong way
i remember that your eyes turned green
when they crowned your sister county queen
though she couldn't hold a candle
to your beauty any day
when you get a chance
would you please call your mother
and thank her for the good years that we had?
gently break the news that you don't love me
and give my best regards to your good old dad
back when we could laugh and play
on family reunion day
didn't we all look funny
in our 1950s clothes?
your daddy wore that greasy stuff
your brother drank more than enough
your mom wore penny loafers
with runners in her hose
when you get a chance
would you please call your mother
and thank her for the good years that we had?
o gently break the news that you don't love me
and give my best regards to your good old dad

would you please call your mother"
"it’s a long and dusty road, it’s a hot and heavy load
and the people that you meet aren’t always kind.
some are bad, some are good, some have done the best they could
some have tried to ease my troubled mind
but i can’t help but wonder
where i’m bound, where i’m bound
i can’t help but wonder where i’m bound
i have been around this land just doing the best i can
trying to find what i was meant to do
and the faces that i see are as worried as can be
and i think that they are wondering too
i had a buddy way back home, till he started out to roam
now i hear he’s out by frisco bay
sometimes when i’ve had a few, his voice comes singing through
and i’m going out to see him some old day
if you see me passing by and you sit and wonder why
you weren’t meant to be a rambler too
nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace them up, and bar the door
and thank the stars for the roof that’s over you"
"a child arrived the other day,
he came to the world in the usual way.
but there were planes to catch and bills to pay,
he learned to walk while i was away,

you know i'm gonna be like you.

and the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.
little boy blue and the man in the moon.
when you coming home dad? i don't know when,
but we'll get together then,
you know we'll have a good time then.
my son turned ten just the other day,
he said, thanks for the ball come on let's play,
can you teach me to throw? i said, not today,
i got a lot to do. he said, that's okay.
he walked away but his smile never dimmed,
he said, i'm gonna be like him,

when you coming home dad? i don't know when,

you know we'll have a good time then.
well, he came from college just the other day,
so much like a man i just had to say,
son i'm proud of you, can you sit for a while.
he shook his head and then he said with a smile,
what i'd really like dad is to borrow the car keys,
see you later can i have them please.
chorus:
and the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.
little boy blue and the man in the moon.
when you coming home son? i don't know when,
but we'll have a good time then dad,
you know we'll have a good time then.
i've long since retired my son's moved away.
i called him up just the other day,
i said, i'd like to see you if you don't mind.
he said, i'd love to dad if i could find the time,
you see my new job's a hassle and the kids
have the flu,
but it's sure nice talking to you dad,
it's been sure nice talking to you.
and as i hung up the phone it occurred to me,
he'd grown up just like me
my boy was just like me.

i yelled stick 'em up  
give me your money, your watches and rings.
well, i called new york and talked to that brain quack
and said doc i gotta have my old brain back
he said i'm sorry there, mr. cash, but i can't do that
he said i put your brain in a chicken last monday
he's singing your songs and makin' lots of money
and i got him signed to a ten year recording contract.

"cisco clifton had a fillin' station about a mile and a half from town
most cars passed unless they were out of gas so cisco was always around
regular gas was all that it sold except tabacco matches and oil
other than that he fixed lots of flats keepin' cisco rough hands soiled
he'd wipe the gas and check the air in a hundred times a day
he patiently gave directions on how to get to the state highway
usually he'd give 'em water or a tyre or two some air
and once a big black cadillac spent seven dollars there
he'd give anybody anything they'd ask and lend anything he had
his tools are tyres bumperjacks or wire to the good ones or the bad
in wintertime there was a depot stove and a table for a checker game
and every mornin' at sunup the same checker players came
so cisco clifton's fillin' station was always in the red
personal loans were personally gone but never a word was said
one mornin' at eight them checker players heard a big bulldozer roar like a freight
and cisco said i hope my kids stay fed when they build that interstate
he'd managed to pay for property where his little fillin' station sat
and friends still came for checker game so cisco settled for that
he wouldn't say so but cisco knew that the interstate was too much to fight
but to keep his will and to pay his bills he did odd jobs at night
he still opened up at sunrise and the checker game went on
the cars flew past on hightest gas and the neighbors had sold out and gone
if a car ever did go by he was lost and if they stopped they were treated the same
so at cisco clifton's fillin' station there's a howdy and a checker game"

i'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
dealin' cards with the old men on the club car
penny a point, ain't nobody keepin' score
then now pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
and feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor
and the sons of pullman porters & the sons of engineers
ride their daddies’ magic carpet made of steel
mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat
and the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
repeat chorus
night time on the city of new orleans
changin' cars in memphis, tennessee
halfway home, we'll be there by mornin'
thru the mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea
but all the towns & people seem to fade into a bad dream
and the steel rail still ain't heard the news
the conductor sings his song again
""the passengers will please refrain:
this train has got to disappear in railroad blues.
repeat chorus"
"well now she ain't exactly what you'd call your all american girl
and some too many truckers took her home
and i'll admid her life would read just like a paperback
and some of what she's done i've said it's wrong
but i said clean your own tables boys and bring out your beer
cause she ain't gonna do it this time
and drink to a use to be barmaid cause she's a lady i choose to be mine
and i ain't exactly been what you call your all american boy
i've done my time in frisco in la
how some of youth are taking pride in what i am
i heard you cussing this decision that i've made
but i said clean your own tables...
and i'll admid her life would read just like a paperback
and some of what she's done well i say is wrong
but i said clean your own tables...
boys if you're able clean your own tables and let me take care of mine"
"early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
i took a shot of cocaine and i shot my woman down
i went right home and i went to bed
i stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head
got up next mornin' and i grabbed that gun
took a shot of cocaine and away i run
made a good run but i run too slow
they overtook me down in juarez mexico
late in the hot joints takin' the pills
in walked the sheriff from jericho hill
he said willy lee your name is not jack brown
you're the dirty heck that shot your woman down
said yes oh yes my name is willy lee
if you've got the warrant just read it to me
shot her down because she made me slow
i thought i was her daddy but she had five more
when i was arrested i was dressed in black
they put me on a train and they took me back
had no friend for to go my bail
they slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
early next mornin' bout a half past nine
i spied the sheriff coming down the line
talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
he said come on you dirty heck into that district court
into the courtroom my trial began
where i was handled by twelve honest men
just before the jury started out
i saw the little judge commence to look about
in about five minutes in walked the man
holding the verdict in his right hand
the verdict read in the first degree
oh, hollered lord lord, have a mercy on me
the judge he smiled as he picked up his ben
99 years in the folsom pen
99 years underneath that ground
i can't forget the day
i shot that bad b**** down
come on you've gotta listen unto me
lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be"
"morning found me lyin' on a floor in new orleans
looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans
feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
and i sure miss my sweet cocaine carolina
met her on an oceanliner called her cocaine carolina
she was quite a lady then and i was twenty two
god knows how much i adored her i just never could afford her
cocaine carolina how did i get hooked on you
so goodbye cocaine carolina you and i are through
i'm going back to sandy scuggs she knows just what to do
she don't love me for my money she just wants my body honey
cocaine carolina how did i get hooked on you
oh someone said if i was lucky i could go back to kentucky
lexington was famous for its bluegrass and its hills
carolina we should get up don't you know we'll have to sped up
baby i should go to california
goodbye cocaine carolina...
oh goodbye cocaine carolina...
oh goodbye cocaine carolina..."
"one of these cold lonesome mornings you're gonna kill me
i'm gonna lay there and i'm gonna die
you will soon give me pain enough to fill me
cause i'm gone past doin' any good to cry
and the warm sunshine is like a stranger there's a cruel violation with the dawn
lord my pain can't stand illumination
and one of these cold lonesome mornings i'll be gone
one of these cold lonesome mornings dark and early
before a wild bird sings i'm gonna fly
while it's still dark and i'm still reachin' for you i'll wake up and i can't cry
but i know my heart can't stand another tremor
now it's holding together i don't know
but just before the dawning's first glimmer
one of these cold lonesome mornings i'm gonna go
yes one of these cold lonesome mornings you're gonna kill me..."
"well it's plain to see you're givin me a cold shoulder
you put a chill on every thrill with a cold shoulder
all the time i wait aroud to get a little squeeze
but nothing ever happen's
cause she just stand there and freeze
it ain't polite to waste moonlight on a cold shoulder
it isn't smart to give me heart a cold shoulder
i need yoour love to warm me trough and trough
but i always get a cold shoulder from you
all the time i wait aroud to get a little squeeze
but nothing ever happen's
cause she just stand there and freeze
it ain't polite to waste moonlight on a cold shoulder
it isn't smart to give me heart a cold shoulder
i need yoour love to warm me trough and trough
but i always get a cold shoulder from you"
"well i used think the color of love would be a rosy red or a pretty pink
and i thought it would be a thirsty man crawlin' home to get a big old drink
and i thought love was spelled like a bell b e double l bell that you ring
stead of wham bam hit your man with a pan
hit him on the head and listen to the birdies sing
oh you heart breakin' love makin' cut me a piece of bacon man of mine
oh you money shiftin' flour siftin' nose liftin' rose of woman kind
just keep on doin' what you're doin' and what you're doin' suits me just fine
and love i tell you something else you blow my mind
well i used to think the color of love would be a soft green like a pea in a pod
and i thought love would strike like a light flashin' down a big old lightning rod
and i thought love was spelled w e double l well that would never run dry
instead of choke choke i'm so broke and dry i can't afford a little bitty tear to cry
ha oh you money turnin' egg churnin' butter burnin' baby of mine
you half crazy lean and lazy pretty as a wilted daisy man of mine
just keep on doin' what you're doin' and what you're doin' suits me just fine

3. medley:
(ride this train
ride this train with me to where the great interstate highways cross the country
a hundred years ago over that very ground long before the roads were there
the lonely pony express rider carried the mail
then came the stagecoach with people and supplies moving across country
today carrying on that tradition is the modern mover of america
the man behind the wheel the truck driver)
six days on the road
« © '58 southern arts music, bmi »
well i pulled out of pittsburgh rolling down that eastern sea board
i got my diesel wound up and she's running like never before
there's a speed zone ahead well alright i don't see a car in sight
six days on the road and i'm gonna make it home tonight
well my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow
there's a flame from her stack and the smoke's blowing black as coal
my home town is coming in sight if you think i'm happy you're right
six days on the road and i'm gonna make it home tonight
six days on the road and i'm gonna make it home tonight
(sixteen forward gears diesel smoke trailing in the wind
eighteen tyres checked and singing on the pavement
five thousand miles to cover three weeks away from home
and it's work mister it demands the best
and whether your run is on interstate 70 or hauling freight down the eastern seaboard
if you're a gear jammer you know there ain't no easy runs)
there ain't no easy run

i was sittin' in the terminal waitin' for my load
when a greenhorn driver came in off of the road
i heard him tell that foreman get my little pink slip
this run is too tough and i'm gonna quit
now the foreman that day happened to be old joe
man he was older than time
he said son how long you been driving this rig
you know i've drove all shapes forms fashions and kinds
and here you are worried about this one little trip
why i've drove a million miles and then some
he looked that greenhorn right in the eye and he said
boy there ain't no easy runs
i've drove for roadway interstate hopewell great lakes
walford mac time mayflower freight lines
specter yellow transit and western and gillete
red ball rider north western big seattle

and if you got a gal in new york they'll send you out on the plains

(the next time you see a big semi roaring down the highway
remember the man at the wheel has a great heritage in america
like the pony express rider the stagecoach driver and the wagon master of old
no matter what the weather no matter where the road
he's the man that delivers the goods
and whatever you eat tonight whatever you wear wherever you sleep
remember it's very likely that it was a trucker
that brought you your food clothers and your bed)

well my ocean is four lanes wide my waves are mountain high
i sail a twenty ton schooner with the will of do or die
and my cargo must go through to the port that waits for me
i live on luck for i drive a truck i'm a sailor on a concrete sea

from coast to coast let's drink a toast
to the sailor on a concrete sea the sailor on a conrete sea

(most of my people and the people i knew back home
made their greatest accomplishments in this life
by hard work with their two bare hands
when a fella has given life a good grind and is lying on his dying bed
with his hands folded crossed his chestbone
feeling the last pumping of his innard workings
one of his good folks ought to raise up his head a tad
and let him take one fadin' look through his eyes once again at his own two hands
and he ought to be proud in his head if he can say
concernin' them hands that all their lying by has been laid by proper
and that's a bunch of times i have done somethin' pretty good with 'em)"
"and she spread her wings and she flew
yup, the nation was flying now
taken to the air, in few hours time you could fly over
all those trails blazed by the pioneers
phonographs were playing the hit songs of the day
alexanders ragtime band
my mother was a lady and here's a song my mama sing
back about 1910 or 1915
come take a trip in my airship
come take a trip round the stars
come take a sail around venus
come take a sail around mars
no one to watch while we're kissin'
no one to see while we spoon
come take a trip in my airship
we'll visit the man in the moon"
"all day i’ve faced a barren waste
without the taste of water, cool water
old dan and i with throats burned dry
and souls that cry for water
cool, clear, water
keep a movin, dan, don’tcha listen to him, dan
he’s a devil, not a man
he spreads the burning sand with water
dan, can ya see that big, green tree?
where the water’s runnin’ free
and it’s waitin’ there for me and you?
the nights are cool and i’m a fool
each star’s a pool of water
cool water
but with the dawn i’ll wake and yawn
and carry on to water
water, water, water
keep a movin, dan, don’tcha listen to him, dan

"i got a crib full of corn, and a turning plow
but the grounds to wet for the hopper now.
got a cultivator and a double tree
a leather line for the hull and gee
let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
i'm doing alright for country trash
i'm saving up dimes for a rainy day
i got about a dollar laid away
the winds from the south and the fishings good
got a pot belly stove a cord of wood
mama turns the left overs into hash i'm doing alright for
country trash
i got a mackinaw and a hunting dog
a cap i ordered from the catolog
a big tall tree that shades the yard a big fat sow for the winters lard
let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
i'm doing alright for
country trash
well there's not much new ground left to plow
and the crops need fertilizer now
my hands don't earn me too much gold
for security when i grow old
but we will all be equal under the grass

country trash and
god's got a heaven for

i'll be doing alright for

"everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
i think you only live to see the lights of town.
i wasted my time when i would try, try, try.
cause when the lights have lost their glow, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.
soon your sugar daddies will all be gone.
you'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
you'll call to me but i'm gonna tell you: ""bye, bye, bye,""
when i turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,
you're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
when everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
you're gonna cry, cry, cry.
i lie awake at night and wait 'til you come in.
you stay a little while and then you're gone again.
every question that i ask, i get a lie, lie, lie.
for every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.
when your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you.
then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
i'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why, why, why?
when i remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.
you're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me there,
it'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.
you're gonna cry, cry, cry."
"this boxcar's been my home since st antone
cause this ankle of mine i turned while hoppin' on
shoots pain that feeds my dreams with luxuries
i see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
i can feel my mother's heartbeat from the track
it's the rhythm of a son that won't be back
lord knows where my mind is takin' me
i see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
if that conductor only knew all the trouble i've been through
just to be here on this train once again
freedom of a hobo ain't so bad
you can dream of all the wealth you might've had
i guess livin' on this train is gettin' to me
i see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
if that conductor only knew all the trouble i've been through
just to be here on this train once again
if there's nothing in this world i've gotta do
but to ride these rails of steel my whole life through
then take away these visions that i see of crystal chandeliers and burgundy
of crystal chandeliers and burgundy of crystal chandeliers and burgundy"

number one   county chart; number 42   pop chart
i remember when i was a lad
times were hard and things were bad
but there's a silver linin' behind every cloud
just poor people that's all we were
tryin' to make a livin' out of blackland earth
but we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud ...
chorus
daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor
me and little brother would join right in there
singin' seems to help a troubled soul
one of these days and it won't be long
i'll rejoin them in a song
i'm gonna join the family circle at the throne ...
no, the circle won't be broken
bye and bye, lord, bye and bye ...
daddy'll sing bass, mama'll sing tenor
me and little brother will join right in there
in the sky, lord, in the sky.
now i remember after work,
mama would call in all of us
you could hear us singin' for a country mile
now little brother has done gone on
but i'll rejoin him in a song
we'll be together again up yonder in a little while.
chorus
daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor
me and little brother would join right in there

"come all you young fellers so young and so fine
and seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mine
it will form as a habit and seep in your soul
'til the blood of your veins runs as black as the coal
where it's dark as the dungeon and damp as the dew
where the dangers are many and the pleasures are few
where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
it's dark as the dungeon way down in the mines
it's many a man i have seen in my day
who lived just to labor his whole life away
like a fiend with his dope or a drunkard his wine
a man must have lust for the lure of the mine
i hope when i'm gone and the ages do roll
my body will blacken and form into coal
then i'll look down from the door of my heavenly home
and pity the miner a digging my bones"
"dear mrs though we've never met i know very much about you
i know that you've got hair that shines like the morning sun
you've got eyes that hold the blueness of the sky
and of the deepest sea on a clear day and a smile that has a sparkle of a diamond
i know that because i've heard him say those things about you
these're the thoughts and the words of a man
who spent many heart breaking years behind prison walls
the father of your children the man who worshipped the very ground that you walk on
he had a picture of you mrs it was old and faded and torn
but you could tell at a glance that he never exaggerated in his thoughts and visions
he never left his cell without first checking to see if he had your picture with him
he was a young man when he first came to prison
and he talked a great deal about you but as the years passed he talked less and less
and during his last year here i don't believe he ever said a word to anybody
he had the appearance of a man much older than he really was
he walked with his head down and his shoulders saggin'
and the walk itself seemed to take a great deal of effort
he never received a letter or had a visitor while he was here in prison
but never did he stop looking and waitin'
every day at mail call you could see him standing close to his bars
with the look of a child awaiting a reward
even after the mailman had passed his cell his pleading eyes would follow beggin'
as always he'd feel of his shirt pocket and then just stand there
staring at the emptiness and as always i could somehow feel the lumb in his throat
and the burning in his eyes you know mrs like just before you start to cry
well i thought you might like to know that they buried his body today
just outside the prison walls
they buried him there because nobody cared enough to claim his body
you know there was even a couple of old convicts there that actually cried
no not because they cared for him but for what he died from they cared for
loneliness every prisoner knows loneliness but some know it more than others
the man that they buried today had died many times
every day he waited hopin' and prayin' for a letter or a card
or just a note or anything to let him know that somewhere out there
somebody cared for him
that assurance never came and today he died mrs
he died from loneliness starved for love a love that nobody ever wanted
you see no man woman or child is immune to the need of love or to be loved
no matter how terrible his crime might have been
the death he died from today was more inhuman
but his suffering is over now and he's resting in a pauper's grave in a prison suit
and in his pocket is an old torn and faded picture of yes of you mrs"
"delia, oh, delia
delia all my life
if i hadn't have shot poor delia
i'd a had her for my wife
delia's gone, one more round
delia's gone
i went up to memphis
and i met delia there
found her in her parlor
and i tied to her chair
delia's gone, one more round
delia's gone
she was low down and trifling
and she was cold and mean
kind of evil make me want to
grab my sub machine
delia's gone, one more round
delia's gone
first time i shot her
i shot her in the side
hard to watch her suffer
but with the second shot she died
delia's gone, one more round
delia's gone
but jailer, oh, jailer
jailer, i can't sleep
'cause all around my bedside
i hear the patter of delia's feet
delia's gone, one more round
delia's gone
so if you woman's devilish
you can let her run
or you can bring her down and do her
like delia got done
delia's gone, one more round
delia's gone"

these things that are pleasin' you,
can hurt you somehow.
don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy,
she'll beat you if she's able.
know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
now it seems to me, some fine things,
have been laid upon your table.

your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home.
and freedom, oh freedom,
well, that's just some people talkin'
your prison is walking,
through this world all alone.
and don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
the sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
it's hard to tell the night time from the day
you're loosin' all your highs and lows
ain't it funny how the feeling,
goes away?
desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
come down from your fences, and open the gate
it may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you,
you better let somebody love you,
you better let somebody love you,
you better let somebody love you,

"i played the red river valley
he'd sit in the kitchen and cry
run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
and wonder, ""lord, why has every well i've drilled gone dry?""
we were friends, me and this old man
we's like desperados waitin' for a train
desperados waitin' for a train
he's a drifter, a driller of oil wells
he's an old school man of the world
he taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to
and he'd wink and give me money for the girls
and our lives was like, some old western movie
like desperados waitin' for a train
like desperados waitin' for a train
from the time that i could walk he'd take me with him
to a bar called the green frog cafe
there was old men with beer guts and dominos
lying 'bout their lives while they played
i was just a kid, they all called me ""sidekick""
just like desperados waitin' for a train
like desperados waitin' for a train
one day i looked up and he's pushin' eighty
he's got brown tobacco stains all down his chin
well to me he was a hero of this country
so why's he all dressed up like them old men
drinkin' beer and playin' moon and forty two
jus' like desperados waitin' for a train
like a desperado waitin' for a train
the day before he died i went to see him
i was grown and he was almost gone.
so we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
and sang another verse to that old song
 come on, jack, that son of a b**** is comin'

the board ain't saying nothing that's lighten in my load
is her destination victoria station
where the trains go out and the trains come in
where the trains go out and the trains come in

i know she was born to ramble but i believed she would ramble back

"last night i went to sleep in detroit city
and i dreamed about those cottonfields and home
i dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
i dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
i wanna go home i wanna go home oh how i wanna go home
homefolks think i'm big in detroit city
from the letters that i write they think i'm fine
but by day i make the cars by night i make the bars
if only they could read between the lines
cause you know i rode the freight train north to detroit city
and after all these years i find i was just wastin' my time
so i just think i'll take my foolish pride
and put on a southbound freight and ride
and go on back to the loved ones i left waiting far behind
i wanna go home i wanna go home oh how i wanna go home
(down in dyess arkansas and that part of the delta land where i grew up
i did my earliest singing and i learned my first songs
while picking or chopping cotton out in a cotton patch
seems somebody was always singing while they worked
to help make the day go a little bit faster
i can remember my sister louisie out in the cottonfields
she would keep us all cheered up by singing gospel songs and the hits of the days
and being a few years older than i was she'd teach me songs she'd say
i'm going to sing you this song three times
and then see if you're listening you sing it back to me
sometimes she'd be way down the row picking ahead of me
and while she was waiting for me to catch up i could hear her singing)"
"it's been ten long years since
the devil laid his fiddle at johnny's feet
and it burned inside his mind
the way he suffered that defeat
in the darkest pits of hell
the devil hatched an evil plan
to tempt the fiddle player for
he's just a mortal man
""the sin of pride,"" the devil
cried is what will do you in
""i thought we had this settled,
i'm the best there's ever been.""
johnny did you ever know
that time keeps marching on
the coldest hour is the one
comes just before the dawn
the devil's back in georgia
will you stand up to the test
or will you let the devil be the best?
""in truth i haven't played much
since the baby came in june
but give me half a minute an'
i'll get this fiddle back in tune""
the devil grabbed the golden
fiddle out of johnny's hand and said
""though i'm the fiddle player
underground and i walk upon the land""
""y'all just better be just turnin'
back if you want this boy to win
'cos practice is the only cure for
the predicament he's in""
""now devil it would be a sin
for you to get my bow
you go on back to hell and to
the wood shed i will go""
johnny are you practicing or
will your hands grow cold?
the devil walks the land and
plays a fiddle made of gold
can you hear the babe a crying,
will he ever know
the devil wants his daddy's very soul?
""before we play i want to
thank you for letting god's
own word ring true
he said you can't be trusted""
""yes but what you gonna do?""
""well you get your fiddle devil if
you think that you can win
'cos i beat you once you old dog
and i can whip your butt again""
john brown's green, the devil is red
mama's little baby loves shortenin and bread
the devil's dream is that he can win
but johnny is the best that's ever been

"about the time that daddy left to fight the big war
i saw my first pistol in the general store
in the general store, when i was thirteen
thought it was the finest thing i ever had seen
so l asked if i could have one when i grew up
mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
she really blew up and i didn't understand
mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
she really blew up and i didn't understand
mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
the devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
my very first pistol was a cap and ball colt
shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
loads a mite slow and i soon found out
it can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
so then i went and bought myself a colt 45
called a peacemaker but i never knew why
never knew why, i didn't understand
cause mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
never knew why, i didn't understand
cause mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
the devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
well i get into a card game in a company town
caught a miner cheating i shot the dog down
shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
the trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
asked me how i pleaded, not guilty i said
not guilty i said, you've got the wrong man
nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
not guilty i said, you've got the wrong man
nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

"don't go near the water children see the fish all dead upon the shore
don't go near the water cause the water isn't water anymore
from the fountains in the mountains comes the water running cool and clear and blue
and it comes down from the hills and it goes down to the towns and passes through
when it gets down to the cities then the water turns into a dirty grey
cause it's poisoned and poluted by the people as it goes along its way
don't go near the water children...
i was sittin' on the bank of the lake at home fishin' with my little boy
i said have you got a bite yet son
he said no sir have you daddy i said i believe i got a nibble
he said daddy if we catch a fish can we cook 'em and eat 'em
i said maybe we'd better not son
they say it may not be safe to eat a fish from this water anymore

treatin' love for sympathy is all to me
what's this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you

i'm sorry that i never knew the way to show my love for you
i took too much for granted all the time
two hearts in love must give and take when one heart feels the other breaks

"a young cowboy named billy joe
grew restless on the farm
a boy filled with wanderlust
who really meant no harm
he changed his clothes and shined his boots
and combed his dark hair down
and his mother cried as he walked out
don't take your guns to town, son
leave your guns at home, bill
don't take your guns to town
he laughed and kissed his mom and said
your billy joe's a man
i can shoot as quick and straight as
anybody can
but i wouldn't shoot without a cause
i'd gun no body down
but his mother cried as he rode away
don't take your guns to town, son
leave your guns at home, bill
don't take your guns to town. ""
he sang a song as on he rode
his guns hung at his hips
he rode into a cattle town
a smile upon his lips
he stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down
but his mother's words echoed again
don't take your guns to town, son
leave your guns at home, bill
don't take your guns to town. ""
he drank his first strong liquor then
to calm his shaking hands
and tried to tell himself
at last he had become a man
a dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
and he heard again his mother's words
don't take your guns to town, son
leave your guns at home, bill
don't take your guns to town
filled with rage, then, billy joe reached for his gun to draw
but the stranger drew his gun
and fired before he even saw
as billy joe fell to the floor
the crowd all gathered 'round
and wondered at his final words
don't take your guns to town, son
leave your guns at home, bill
don't take your guns to town. """

far into september
but i had no one to give the flowers to
i needed a celebration
a september coronation
and i admitted to myself i needed you
i've watched the gentle winds change
the colors shades of meadows
ive seen the dew on flowers that had no name
but i let my vase stay empty
like my lonely empty heart
picking flowers for yourself is not the same
don't you think its come our time to be together
lets gather up our scattered words of love
and make them rhyme
let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
don't you think its come out time
 would you take this small bouquet
that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
and a feeling that your love is close at hand
 thank you for the flowers
now lets walk through the meadows
through the brook where our demands caress the sand

lets gather up our scattered words of love
and make them rhyme

maybe they will never wed sure they may break up instead

ira hayes
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
gather round me people there's a story i would tell
about a brave young indian you should remember well
from the land of the pima indian
a proud and noble band
who farmed the phoenix valley in arizona land
down the ditches for a thousand years
the water grew ira's peoples' crops
'till the white man stole the water rights
and the sparklin' water stopped
now ira's folks were hungry
and their land grew crops of weeds
when war came, ira volunteered
and forgot the white man's greed
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
there they battled up iwo jima's hill,
two hundred and fifty men
but only twenty seven lived to walk back down again
and when the fight was over
and when old glory raised
among the men who held it high
was the indian, ira hayes
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
ira returned a hero
celebrated through the land
he was wined and speeched and honored; everybody shook his hand
but he was just a pima indian
no water, no crops, no chance
at home nobody cared what ira'd done
and when did the indians dance
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
then ira started drinkin' hard;
jail was often his home
they'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone!
he died drunk one mornin'
alone in the land he fought to save
two inches of water in a lonely ditch
was a grave for ira hayes
call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinkin' indian
nor the marine that went to war
yeah, call him drunken ira hayes
but his land is just as dry
and his ghost is lyin' thirsty
in the ditch where ira died"

upside down the engine turned and georgie's breast was smashed

the doctor said to georgie my darling boy lie still
your life may yet be saved if it is god's blessed will
oh no said george that will not do i want to die so free
i want to die with the engine i love one hundred and forty three

murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave
his face was covered up with blood his eyes they could not see

i could touch you if i tried, fields of diamonds in the sky.
am i just a star in some crown?
or someone's life sun going down, down, down?
field of diamonds in the sky, silent beauty shining high.
are you tears the angels cry?
field of diamonds in the sky"
"the first time ever i saw your face, i thought the sun rose in your eyes.
and the moon and stars were the gifts you gave,
to the dark and the endless sky, my love.
and the first time ever i kissed your mouth,
i felt the earth move through my hands.
like the trembling heart of a captive bird
that was there at my command.
and the first time ever i lay with you,
i felt your heart so close to mine.
and i know our joy would fill the earth,
and last till the end of time, my love.
the first time ever i saw your face."
"my mama always taught me that good things come from
adversity if we put our faith in the lord.
we couldn't see much good in the flood waters when
they
were causing us to have to leave home,
but when the water went down, we found that it had
washed a load of rich black bottom dirt across our
land. the following year we had the best cotton crop
we'd ever had.
i remember hearing:
how high's the water, mama?
two feet high and risin'
how high's the water, papa?
two feet high and risin'
we can make it to the road in a homemade boat
that's the only thing we got left that'll float
it's already over all the wheat and the oats,
two feet high and risin'
how high's the water, mama?
three feet high and risin'
how high's the water, papa?
three feet high and risin'
well, the hives are gone,
i've lost my bees
the chickens are sleepin'
in the willow trees
cow's in water up past her knees,
three feet high and risin'
how high's the water, mama?
four feet high and risin'
how high's the water, papa?
four feet high and risin'
hey, come look through the window pane,
the bus is comin', gonna take us to the train
looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain,
4 feet high and risin'
how high's the water, mama?
five feet high and risin'
how high's the water, papa?
five feet high and risin'
well, the rails are washed out north of town
we gotta head for higher ground
we can't come back till the water comes down,
five feet high and risin'
well, it's five feet high and risin'"
"beside a singin' mountain stream
where the willow grew
where the silver leaf of maple
sparkled in the mornin' dew
i braided twigs of willows
made a string of buckeye beads;
but flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and you're the one i need
flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and you're the one i need.
i leaned against a bark of birch
and i breathed the honey dew
i saw a north bound flock of geese
against a sky of baby blue
beside the lily pads
i carved a whistle from a reed;
mother nature's quite a lady
but you're the one i need
flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and you're the one i need.
a cardinal sang just for me
and i thanked him for the song
then the sun went slowly down the west
and i had to move along
these were some of the things
on which my mind and spirit feed;
but flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and you're the one i need
flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and you're the one i need.
so when this day was ended
i was still not satisfied
for i knew ev'rything i touched
would wither and would die
and love is all that will remain
and grow from all these seed;
mother nature's quite a lady
but you're the one i need
flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and you're the one i need."
"from the back door of your life you swept me out dear
in the bredline of your dreams i lost my place
at the table of your love i got to brush off
at the indianapolis of your heart i lost the race
i've been washed down the sink of your conscience up
in the theatre of your love i lost my part
and now you say you've got me out of your consience
i've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart
in the garbage disposal of your dreams i've been ground up dear
on the river of your plans i'm up the creek
up the elevator of your future i've been shafted
on the calendar of your events i'm last week
i've been washed down the sink of your conscience up
in the theatre of your love i lost my part
and now you say you've got me out of your consience
i've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart"
"well if i live to be a hundred, i won't forget the day
i broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away
that's when they hung my name in the fool's hall of fame
ah baby since we've been apart, i can't console my heart
it cries and cries all night long
can't i ever make you see this change you've made in me
just give me a chance to tell you i was wrong
yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
you know i'll keep on a beggin till you come back to me

"now you've all heard foolish questions and no doubt you've wondered why
some person will ask a foolish question and expect a sensible reply
like when you take your girl some candy, say maybe just after tea
you notice how she'll grab it and then she'll say, ""is this for me?""
foolish questions! you can answer when you can
""no i bought this candy for your ma or pa, or for john the hired hand
""i just thought you'd like to see it. now i'm gonna take it away""
now wasn't that a foolish question? you'll hear `em ev'ry day
and then most every morning, there is someone `round the place
who sees you take the shaving brush and lather up your face
and as you give the razor a preliminary wave
this fool will walk up and ask you, ""are you gonna take a shave?""
foolish questions! your answer is, i hope
""no! i ain't prepared for shavin', i just like the taste of soap!
i kinda like to take the shaving brush and paint myself this way""
now wasn't that a foolish question? you'll hear `em ev'ry day!
now then there's this fella who meets you on your way
and asks you why your all dressed up and listens while you say
that you just been returning from the funeral of poor old uncle ned
as soon as you have told him, he will say, ""is ned dead?""
foolish questions! you might as well reply
""no, he thought he'd have the funeral now. then later on he'd die
you know ned was always so original, he wanted it that way""
now wasn't that a foolish question? you'll hear `em ev'ry day!
now suppose the elevator guy should forget to close the door
and you should tumble down, oh say forty seven floors
and when you reach the bottom and you're lying there inert
some fool will stick his head down the shaft and holler, ""are you hurt?""
foolish questions! your dying words are
""no! i was in an awful hurry and that elevator's just too slow
usually saves a lot of time, you know, comin' down this way""
now wasn't that a foolish question? you'll hear `em ev'ry day!
that was a foolish question! you'll hear `em ev'ry day!"
"well if i live to be a hundred, i won't forget the day
i broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away

"don't look so sad, i know it's over.
but life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning.
let's just be glad we had some time to spend together.
there's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning.
lay your head upon my pillow.
hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
hear the whisper of the raindrops,
blowin' soft against the window,
and make believe you love me one more time,
for the good times.
i'll get along; you'll find another,
and i'll be here if you should find you ever need me.
don't say a word about tomorrow or forever,
there'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me.
lay your head upon my pillow.
hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
hear the whisper of the raindrops,
blowin' soft against the window,
and make believe you love me one more time,
for the good times."
"i will drink the cup
the poison overflowing
i will lift you up
watch over where you're going
the first one in
the last one gone
i'll be the rock
to stand upon
for you, for you
my spirit aches
and i can't stop this river flowing
in fear i take
each labored breath i draw in knowing
that this could be my life
my final hour
but faith and hope and love
give me the power
for you, for you
yay though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of death
i will fear no evil
for you are with me
you are with me
i'll be your salvation
though the storm surrounding
there are no conditions
lay my body down
in the wake abandon
willing sacrifice
i'll walk through the canyon
bring the shadows light
for you, for you
i will drink the cup
the poison overflowing
i will lift you up
watch over where you're going
the first one in
the last one gone
i'll be the rock to stand upon
the first one in
the last one gone
i'll be the rock to stand upon
for you
for you
for you
for you"
"i close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea
from the fishing boats at dingle to the shores of dunardee
i miss the river shannon and the folks at skibbereen
the moorlands and the midlands with their forty shades of green
but most of all i miss a girl in tipperary town
and most of all i miss her lips as soft as eiderdown
again i want to see and do the things we've done and seen
where the breeze is sweet as shalimar and there's forty shades of green
i wish that i could spend an hour at dublin's churching surf
i'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf
to see again the thatching of the straw the women glean
i'd walk from cork to larne to see the forty shades of green
but most of all i miss a girl..."
"four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high,
all these things that won't change, come what may.
well our good times are all gone, and i'm bound for moving on.
i'll look for you if i'm ever back this way.
think i'll go out to alberta, weather's good there in the fall.
got some friends that i can go to workin' for.
yet i wish you'd change your mind, if i asked you one more time
but we've been through this a hundred times or more.
if i get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good.
you could meet me if i sent you down the fare,
but by then it would be winter, not much for you to do.
and the winds can sure blow cold way up there."
"i keep puttin' off my letters hopin' tomorrow will bring better news
of what's to come my darlin'
i know it's so hard for you to sit while i try and do
the things i am i'm not a man
so i'll kick up the dust while i wonder through the fields that i must
knowin' all the time that i'm just
walkin' toward those friendly gates i trust
i keep prayin' every night that the land i have in sight
won't be gone when the mornin' comesfor the faith you placed in me
is all the ground there needs to be for everything i ever dreamed
so i'll kick up the dust while i wonder through the fields that i must
knowin' all the time that i'm just
walkin' toward those friendly gates i trust
the feelin' that i get from the candles you have lit
in my lonely mind i've got to find
for me to give up now would be the only reasons
how i could never live the way i wanna live
so i'll kick up the dust while i wonder through the fields that i must
knowin' all the time that i'm just
walkin' toward those friendly gates i trust
walkin towards those friendly gates i trust"
"where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
i'll meet you further on up the road
got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
my lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing
i got a song to sing, it keeps me out of the cold
and i'll meet you further on up the road.
further on up the road
further on up the road
where the way is dark and the night is cold
one sunny mornin' we'll rise i know
and i'll meet you further on up the road.
now i been out in the desert, just doin' my time
searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign
if there's a light up ahead, well brother i don't know
but i got this fever burnin' in my soul
further on up the road
further on up the road
further on up the road
further on up the road
one sunny mornin' we'll rise i know
and i'll meet you further on up the road
one sunny mornin' we'll rise i know
and i'll meet you further on up the road."
"it's knowin' that your door is always open
and your path is free to walk
that makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
rolled up and stashed behind your couch
and it's knowin' i'm not shackled
by forgotten words and bonds
and the ink stains that have dried upon some line
that keeps you in the back roads
by the rivers of my memory
that keeps you ever gentle on my mind
it's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
planted on their columns now that bind me
or something that somebody said because
they thought we fit together walkin'
it's just knowing that the world
will not be cursing or forgiving
when i walk along some railroad track and find
that you're movin' on the back roads
by the rivers of my memory
and for hours you're just gentle on my mind
though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
and the junkyards and the highways come between us
and some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and i was gone
i still might run in silence
tears of joy might stain my face
and the summer sun might burn me till i'm blind
but not to where i cannot see
you walkin' on the back roads
by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
i dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
in some train yard
my beard a rustlin' coal pile
and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
through cupped hands 'round a tin can
i pretend to hold you to my breast and find
that you're waitin' from the back roads
by the rivers of my memory
ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind"
"on a rainy, windy morning that's the day that i was born on
in the old sharecroppers one room country shack
they say my mammy left me, same day that she had me
said she hit the road and never once looked back
and i just thought i'd mention, my grandma's old age pension
is the reason why i'm standing here today
i got all my country learning, living and a churning
pickin' cotton, rasin' hell, and bailin' hay
i've been to georgia on a fast train honey
i wudn't born no yestday
got a good christian raisin' and an eighth grade education
ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way
and now sweet caroline, i don't guess i'll ever find
another woman put together like you all
with your wiggle and your walkin', and your big city talkin'
your brand new shiny plymouth rag top car
yeah it's hurry up and wait, in this world of give and take
seems like haste makes for waste every time
and i pray to my soul, when you hear those ages roll
you better know i'm gonna get my share of mine
i've been to georgia on a fast train honey
i wudn't born no yestday
got a good christian raisin' and an eighth grade education
ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way"

bendin' low at the peoples' feet
on the windy corner of the dirty street

how'd he keep from gettin' the blues
he grinned as he raised his little head
popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

he took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
he stopped once to wipe the sweat away
i said you're a mighty little boy to be a workin' that way
he said i like it with a big wide grin
kept on a poppin' and he said again

"the girl from the canyon smiled a smile that brought me home
as sick and bleeding as i was she took me on her own
brought me to the canyon where the sun poured down like rain
her smiling eyes and the mountain light i thought myself insane
these hills have seen me runnin' till my horse could hardly stand
hidin' by day in the mountains movin' with the moon on the land
i'm hoping to find my freedom in a world that wants me dead
the girl from the canyon took and healed my wounds instead
the girl from the canyon she don't need to know what i had done
she laughed with me in the moonlight till the morning brought the sun
the girl from the canyon the girl from the canyon she was the only one
an outlaw is a hunted one with aprice upon his head
we're all outlaws in a way that is what she said
and so i left the canyon when i was strong enough to ride
the girl from the canyon she was riding by my side
the girl from the canyon..
she was the only one"

if you're travellin' in the north country fair

she once was a true love of mine.
see for me that her hair is hanging down
if it curls and falls all down her breast,
see for me that her hair is hanging down
that's the way i remember her best.
if you go when the snowflakes fall,
when the rivers freeze and summer ends
please see for me if she is wearing
her coat so warm
to keep her from the howlin' winds.
if you're travellin' in the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
please say hello to one who lives there
she once was a true love of mine.

"when robert e lee surrended the confederacy jefferson davis was upset about it
he said how dare that man resent an order
form the president of the confederate states of america
then somebody told him that general lee had made the decision himself
in order to save lives because he felt that the battle comin' up
would cost about 20 000 lives on both sides
and he said 240 000 dead already is enough
so this song is not about the north or the south but about the bloody brother war
brother against brother father against son the war that nobody won
and for all those lives that were saved i gotta say dod bless robert e lee
well the mansion where the general used to live is burning down
cottonfields are blue with sherman's troups
i overheard a yankee say yesterday nashville fell
so i'm on my way to join the fight general lee might need my help
but look away look away dixie i don't want them to see
what they're doing to my dixie god bless robert e lee
sherman's troups burned atlanta and the flames lit up the sky
and those of us who survived it are watchin' my dixie die
but today at appamattox general lee sat down
and surrended to the yankees and ulysees s grant
so look away look away dixie...

"the old home town looks the same,
as i step down from the train,
and there to meet me is my mama and my papa.
down the road i look, and there comes mary,
hair of gold and lips like cherries.
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
the old house is still standing,
though the paint is cracked and dry,
and there's the old oak tree that i used to play on.
down the lane i walk with my sweet mary,
hair of gold and lips like cherries.
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
yes, they'll all come to see me,
arms reaching, smiling sweetly.
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
then i awake and look around me,
at the four gray walls that surround me,
and i realize that i was only dreaming.
for there's a guard, and there's a sad old padre,
arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.
again, i'll touch the green, green grass of home.
yes, they'll all come to see me
in the shade of the old oak tree,
as they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home."
"inside the walls of prison my body may be,
but my lord has set my soul free.
there's a grey stone chapel here at folsom,
a house of worship in this den of sin.
you wouldn't think that god had a place here at folsom,
but he saved the soul of many lost men.
now this grey stone chapel here at folsom,
stands a hundred years old made of granite rock.
it takes a ring of keys to move here at folsom,
but the door to the house of god is never locked.
inside the walls of prison my body may be
but the lord has set my soul free.
there are men here that don't ever worship.
there are men here who scoff at the ones who pray.
but i've got down on my knees in that grey stone chapel,
and i've thanked the lord for helping me each day.
now this grey stone chapel here at folsom,
it has a touch of god's hand on every stone.
it's a flower of light in a field of darkness,
and it's given me the stregth to carry on.
inside the walls of prison my body may be,
but my lord has set my soul free.

i'm comin' home to you, can you see me comin' thru
thru clouds of persecution, and stumblin' on my way
i 'spect i'm only makin', 'bout a half a mile a day.
the road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,
it's one way with no changes heading to the promised land.
but i believe that if i'll heed the things he had to say,
even i might get to heaven at a half a mile a day.

then sometimes others pull me, off of your narrow way
and by my mistakes, i barely make, a half a mile a day."

"in the desert where we searched for gold the days're hot the nights're cold

on the beach i built sand castles too

"let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
while we all sup sorrow with the poor
there's a song that will linger forever in our ears
oh, hard times, come again no more.
'tis the song, the sign of the weary
hard times, hard times, come again no more
many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
oh hard times, come again no more.
while we seek mirth and beauty and music light and g**
there are frail forms fainting at the door
though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
oh, hard times, come again no more.
'tis the song, the sign of the weary
hard times, hard times, come again no more
many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
oh hard times, come again no more.
there's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
with a worn heart, whose better days are o'er
though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
oh, hard times, come again no more.
'tis the song, the sign of the weary
hard times, hard times, come again no more
many days you have lingered all around my cabin door

"life was rough on the lone prairie
we didn't have it made
the northern winds brought the cold snow flury
and brought us close to the grave
you carried our child through the warm spring haul
and if all went well you'd be a mother come to fall
we had hard times comin' with twisters on the ground
we had tumbleweeds runnin'
and they would almost knocked you down
we would hide beneath the storm cellar's door
and without you there i couldn't take it anymore
we had hard times comin' but with your loving we made it alright
the river swelled till the flash
blood raged washing out the plains
the cottonwood stood with strength of age
and like the trees we remained
it takes the true woman who believes in her man
to stand at his side while he's struggling for his land
we had hard times comin' with sand storms all around
we had prairie hay burnin' our house burned right to the ground
oh the hardships never did seem to in
but when i'd fall down you'd picked me right back up again
we had hard times comin' but with your loving we made it alright
we had hard times comin' but with your loving we made it alright"

she still prayed upon his mind.
he kept her picture on the wall.
went half crazy now and then.
but he still loved her through it all,
hoping she'd come back again.
kept some letters by his bed,
dated 1962.
he had underlined in red
every single 'i love you'.
i went to see him just today,
but i didn't see no tears.
all dressed up to go away,
first time i'd seen him smile in years.

"on the shores of gitchgoomy by the shining big sea water
hiawatha old and greyin' listened to the older prophet listened to lagu
and the young men and the women from the land of ojibways
from the land of the dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies
stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell hiawatha
i have seen he said a water bigger that the big sea water
broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it
salty so that none would use it
hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting
and he spoke to all the people
it's true what lagu tells you for i have seen it in a vision
i have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning
and upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions
bigger than a grove of pine trees taller than the tallest tree tops
and upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly
and it carried many people strange and foreign were these people
and white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered
then said hiawatha i beheld a darker vision
many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies
in our woodlands rang their axes in our valleys smoked their cities
our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils
left their homelands going westward wild and woeful
and the man with bearded faces the men with skin so fair
with their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people
farther westward westward westward then wild wild and wilder
grew the west that once was ours"

you always said that that should be my middle name
but you don't know the half of it you don't know how that name fits

you said you'd stand by me until i cleared my name
sure it's easy to be strong when you know the charge is wrong

hidden shame shame shame that i can't get free
from the blame and the torture and the misery
must it be my secret for eternity?
till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me
i've had a friend when i was just a boy
we were like brothers we would run and hide
and we went walking on a high hillside
and i really don't know how it happened
he turned to me and had this strange look in his eyes
and not a single word was spoken
i must have pushed him but i don't remember why
and all at once he lay there broken
and i walked out without him and i buried it deep inside
hidden shame shame shame that i can't get free
from the blame and the torture and the misery
must it be my secret for eternity?
till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me
they say you always hurt the one you love
and i'm not sayin' if i did or if i didn't
but like my shame that kind of love is always hidden
they locked me up here for the ideas in my head
they never got me for the thing i really did
hidden shame shame shame that i can't get free
from the blame and the torture and the misery
must it be my secret for eternity?

"i was a highwayman.
along the coach roads i did ride
with sword and pistol by my side
many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
the bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
but i am still alive.
i was a sailor.
i was born upon the tide
and with the sea i did abide.
i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico
i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
and when the yards broke off they said that i got
killed
but i am living still.
i was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
where steel and water did collide
a place called boulder on the wild colorado
i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
they buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
but i am still around... i'll always be around...
and around and around and around and around
i fly a starship across the universe divide
and when i reach the other side
i'll find a place to rest my spirit if i can
perhaps i may become a highwayman again
or i may simply be a single drop of rain
but i will remain
and i'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..."

"early one morning
with time to kill
i borrowed jebb's rifle
and sat on a hill
i saw a lone rider
crossing the plain
i drew a bead on him
to practice my aim
my brother's rifle
went of in my hand
a shot rang out
across the land
the horse, he kept running
the rider was dead
i hung my head
i hung my head
i set off running
to wake from the dream
my brother's rifle
went into the sheen
i kept on running
into the south lands
that's where they found me
my head and my hands
the sheriff he asked me
why had i run
and then it came to me
just what i had done
and all for no reason
just one peace of lead
i hung my head
i hung my head
here in the court house
the whole town was there
i see the judge
high up in the chair
explain to the court room
what went through you mind
and we'll ask the jury
what verdict they find
i felt the power
of death over life
i orphaned his children
i widowed his wife
i begged their forgiveness
i wish i was dead
i hung my head
i hung my head
i hung my head
i hung my head
early one morning
with time to kill
i see the gallows
up on a hill
and out in the distance
a trick of the brain
i see a lone rider
crossing the plain
and he'd come to fetch me
to see what they'd done
and we'd ride together
to kingdom come
i prayed for god's mercy
for soon i'd be dead
i hung my head
i hung my head
i hung my head
i hung my head"
"well the blue's still in the water and the blue's still in the sky
and way beyond the blue there's someone watchin' from on high
my clothes may be ragged and my shoes may be worn
but i've been a wealthy boy since i've been born
cause i call him when i'm troubled and i call him when i'm weak
and he always pulls me through my troubles some way and i believe
he'll be there  he'll be there like he always is to answer when i call him
my mother used to tell me i should take it slow
the pace is not what matters it's the direction that you go
keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal
you'll have all the joy a heart could ever hold
cause i call him when i'm troubled...
like he always is to answer when i call him"
"i couldn't manage the problems i laid on myself
and it just made it worse when i laid them on somebody else
so i finally surrendered it all brought down in despair
i cried out for help and i felt a warm comforter there
and i came to believe in a power much higher than i
i came to believe that i needed help to get by
in childlike faith i gave in and gave him a try
and i came to believe in a power much higher than i
nothing worked out when i handled it all on my own
and each time i failed it made me feel twice as alone
then i cried, ""lord there must be a sure and easier way
for it just cannot be that a man should lose hope every day. ""
and i came to believe in a power much higher than i
i came to believe that i needed help to get by
in childlike faith i gave in and gave him a try
and i came to believe in a power much higher than i
yes, i came to believe in a power much higher than i"
"today i passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
i can't help it if i'm still in love with you
somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
i can't help it if i'm still in love with you
a picture from the past came slowly stealing
as i brushed your arm and walked so close to you
then suddenly i got that old time feeling
i can't help it if i'm still in love with you
it's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
and hold you just the way i used to do
oh heaven only knows how much i miss you
i can't help it if i'm still in love with you"
"oh death, where is thy sting?
oh grave, where is thy victory?
oh life, you are a shining path
and hope springs eternal just over the rise
when i see my redeemer beckoning me
oh roll my ship over the waves of your sea
let me find a safe port now and then
don’t let the dark one in your sanctuary
until it’s time to pack it in
oh roll my ship with the fire of your breath
and don’t lay a broadside on your ship as yet
blow ye warm winds when it’s chilly and wet
and don’t come too soon for collecting my debt
oh death, where is thy sting?
oh grave, where is thy victory?
oh life, you are a shining path
and hope springs eternal just over the rise
when i see my redeemer beckoning me
oh let me sail on with my ships to the east
and keep my eye on the north star
when the journey is no good for men or for beast
i’ll be safe wherever you are
just let me sail into your harbor of lights
and there and forever to cast out my line
give me my task and let me do it right
and do it with all of my might"
"i saw you walking by his side heard you whisper all those lies
and i couldn't keep from crying
you sang him love songs tenderly that should have been for you and me
and i couldn't keep from crying
i saw his eyes drinking your charms while he held you in his arms
him with all his wedding ways rules your heart now in my place
i stood and watched him steal a kiss from two lips i know i'll miss
and i couldn't keep from crying
i saw his eyes drinking your charms..."
"i do believe that i won't make it through the night
if you don't come on back to me and love me now
there ain't no way that i can say that it's all right
i do believe that you're not thinking anyhow
but i believe if you'll remember how it was a little while
if you'll recall that what we had was hard to beat
and i believe that if you'll meet me half way down that second mile
we will trade in all the bitter for the sweet
i do believe that you're not happy without me
i think you feel the way i'm feeling without you
come on and give in to that feeling one more time
i do believe you won't regret it if you do
but i believe if you'll remember..."
"it don’t hurt anymore
all my teardrops are dried
no more walkin’ the floor
with that burnin’ inside
just to think it could be
time has opened the door
and at last i am free
i don’t hurt anymore
no use to deny i wanted to die the day you said we were thru
but now that i find you’re out of my mind i can’t believe that it’s true
i’ve forgotten somehow that i cared so before
and it’s wonderful now i don’t hurt anymore"
"i don't know where i'm bound, i don't know where i'm bound,
whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
and i don't know where i'm bound.
can't stand bars, locks, or doors,
mean cops, insanity, and wars;
gotta find a place of peace,
until then, my traveling won't cease,
but i don't know where i'm bound.
there's gotta be a place for me,
under some green growing tree;
clear cool water running by,
an unfettered view of the sky,
but i don't know where i'm bound.
when i die, don't bury me,
cause then i must be free;
cremate my body with a grin,
throw my ashes to the wind,
cause i don't know where i'm bound.
i don't know where i'm bound, i don't know where i'm bound,
whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
and i don't know where i'm bound.
got myself a little gal,
she has been a downright pal;
that old highway's calling me,
and free i gotta be,
but i don't know where i'm bound, i don't know where i'm bound.
i don't know where i'm bound."
"she gave me my walking papers
and ran off with someone new
cuz he bought her things
my wages couldn't buy
so i turned to ups and downers
and everything in between
still i can't get her good lovin'
off my mind
well today i bought a cadillac
the kind she's always wanted
i called and asked her
if she'd like to ride
she said this is our last date
i said that's alright with me
cause tonight i'm driving her
out of my mind
yeah i'll take her on a scenic cruise
right off of lookout mountain
cause she said i never took her out
when she was mine
she'll see all seven states
as we drive to the pearly gates
tonight when i drive her
out of my mind
all the papers will read ""lovers leap
again off lookout mountain""
cause i wrote a note
that called it suicide
but my epitaph will say
""he killed his pain yesterday
when he finally drove that woman
off his mind""
well now here she comes to greet me
dressed to kill and so am i
hope she asks me if this
cadillac will fly
and i know that i'll die laughin'
when i show her that it will
when i drive that woman
right out of my mind
hell i'll take her on a scenic cruise
right off of lookout mountain
cause she said i never took her out
when she was mine
she'll see all seven states
as we drive to the pearly gates
tonight when i drive her
out of my mind
they'll say johnny cash was quite a smash
down here in chatanooga
last night when he drove her
out of his mind
yeah that cadillac dealer's
in for a big surprise too
99 dollars down, 99 dollars a month
yeah it's gonna be just gorgeous"

"you think you know the smile on her lips the thrill at the touch of her fingertips
but i forgot more than you'll ever know about her
you think you'll find a heaven of bliss in each caress and each tender kiss
but i forgot more than you'll ever know about her
you stole her love from me one day you didn't care how you've hurt me
but you can never steal away mem'ries of what used to be
you think she's yours to have and to hold
but someday you'll learn when her love grows cold
that i forgot more than you'll ever know about her
you stole her love from me..."
"i forgot to remember to forget her
i can't seem to get her off my mind
i thought i'd never miss her
but i found out somehow
i think about her almost all the time

the day she went away
i made myself a promise
that i'd soon forget we'd ever met

i forgot to remember to forget

"i was ridin' number nine,
headin' south from caroline.
i heard that lonesome whistle blow.
got in trouble, had to roam,
i left my gal an' left my home.
i heard that lonesome whistle blow.
just a kid, actin' smart,
i went and broke my darling's heart,
i guess i was too young to know.
they took me off the georgia main,
locked me to a ball and chain.
i heard that lonesome whistle blow.
all alone i bear the shame,
i'm a number, not a name.
i heard that lonesome whistle blow.
all i do is set  an' cry
when the evenin' train goes by.
i heard that lonesome whistle blow.
i'll be locked here in this cell
till my body's just a shell
an' my hair turns whiter than snow.
i'll never see that gal of mine.
lord, i'm in georgia doin' time.
i heard that lonesome whistle blow.

"i heard the bells on christmas day their old familiar carols play
and wild and sweet the words repeat of peace on earth goodwill to men
i thought how as the day had come the belfries of all christendom
had rolled along unbroken song of peace on earth goodwill to men
and in despair i bowed my head there is no peace on earth i said
for hate is strong that mocks the song of peace on earth goodwill to men
(then pealed the bells more loud and deep god is not dead nor doubt he sleeps
the wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men)
till ringin' singin' on its way the world revolve from night to day
a voice a chime a chance so blind on earth goodwill to men
then pealed the bells more loud and deep god is not dead nor doubt he sleeps
the wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men"
"early one morning
with time to kill
i borrowed jebbâ€™s rifle
and sat on a hill
i saw a lone rider
crossing the plain
i drew a bead on him
to practice my aim
my brotherâ€™s rifle
went off in my hand
a shot rang out
across the land
the horse, he kept running
the rider was dead
i hung my head
i hung my head
i set off running
to wake from the dream
my brotherâ€™s rifle
went into the sheen
i kept on running
into the south lands
thatâ€™s where they found me
my head and my hands
the sheriff he asked me
why had i run
and then it came to me

" i never picked cotton but my mother did and my brother did and my sister did and my daddy died young workin' in the coal mine
when i was just a baby too little for a cotton sack i played in the dirt while the others worked 'til they couldn't straighten up their backs i made myself a promise when i was big enough to run that i'd never stay a single day in that oklahoma sun
 folks said i grew up early and that the farm couldn't hold me then so i stole ten bucks and a pickup truck and i never went back again then it was fast cars and whiskey long haired girls and fun i had everything that money could bring and i took it all with a gun
 it was saturday night in memphis when a redneck grabbed my shirt when he said go back to your cotton sack i left him dying in the dirt they'll take me in the morning to the gallos just outside and in the time i got there ain't a hell of alot that i can look back on with pride"

he took my hand, he called my name.
he bid me look the other way;
i saw a man, i heard him say
chorus:
he said if i be lifted up
i'll draw all men to me.
he turned and then i saw
the nail scarred hands
that bled for me.
i touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there
my life my heart i gave,
my soul was in his care.
when i awoke my heart beat so and in the dark i saw a glow.
this was no dream he turned my way.

a love for everyone i know
and you know i have a drive,
to leave i won't let go
but can you see this opposition,
comes rising up sometimes
and its deadfull imposition,
comes blacking through my mind
and then i see a darkness did you know how much i love you
cause i'm hoping some day how you
you saved me from this darkness
well i hope that someday
we'll find peace in our lives
together or apart
alone or with our wives
and we can stop our whoring
and draw the smiles inside
and light it up forever
and never go to sleep

whether we are saved or, whether all is well;
they say we only can hope and, trust that it is so,

yes, i know when jesus saved me ,
the very moment he forgave me ;
he took away my heavy burden ,
and he gave me peace within .
satan can't make me doubt it ,
it's real and i'm gonna shout it ;
'cause i was there when it happened ,
and i guess i ought to know .

the heavy burdens lifted and the vile sins go,

"i'd rather go to a rodeo then shoppin' on rodeo drive
i'd rather lay on the grass with you and watch the planes than to have to fly
i'd rather have you than ringling and barnum & baily circus with all three rings
and the high trapeez and the lady on the horse and the train that carries them thru
stacked up against all the gold in africa, i'd rather have you
i'd rather share a hotdog with you than dinner with the president

just the two of us alone will do, i'd rather have you
i'd rather have tickets to the movies with you than the one that wins the lottery
rather walk on the beach with you than to own all the ships at sea

i did things that i'm sorry for i lived to have my fun
but now the world that once was bright is empty and bare
and if you wouldn't be ashamed of me i'd still be there
i'd be with you where i belong
and nothing they could do or say could make me think it's wrong
if all the love that made you mine could make you still care
i'd be by your side i'd still be there
i'd give the world if i could only have you close to me
i'd pray the lord to keep you safe wherever you may be
don't let anybody share the things we used to share

i'd be with you where i belong...
i'd be by your side i'd still be there"

i'll be all smiles tonight, love, i'll be all smiles tonight
though my heart may break tomorrow, i'll be all smiles tonight
oh when the dance commences, oh how i will rejoice
i'll sing the songs he taught me without a faulting voice
when the flattering ones come around me they'll think my heart is light
though my heart may break tomorrow, i'll be all smile tonight
and when the room he entered with a bride upon his arm
i stood and gazed upon him as though he was a charm
and once he smiled upon her as once he'd smiled at me
they knew not what i suffered, they found no change in me
and when the dance is over and all have gone to rest
i'll think of him, dear mother, the one that i love best
he once did love me dearly and ne'er from me would part
he sought not to deceive me, false friends have changed his heart"

he sounds too blue to fly.
the midnight train is whining low:
i'm so lonesome i could cry.
i've never seen a night so long,
when time goes crawling by.
the moon just went behind a cloud,
to hide its face and cry.
did you ever see a robin weep,
when leaves begin to die?
that means he's lost his will to live.
i'm so lonesome i could cry.
instrumental break.
the silence of a falling star,
lights up a purple sky.
and then as i wonder where you are,
i'm so lonesome i could cry.
i'm so lonesome i could cry."

"you'd have thought a king had died
the way those people cried
instead of one more broken entertainer
it struck those in his trade
he could have had it made
if he'd only been a little saner
they traveled far to see him
oh, the humble and the high
they said goodbye as if he were a friend
now somewhere he is smiling
on those who idolized him
but would they even recognize him
if he came back again?
he was born of modest means
but had outrageous dreams
they never let him rest
till he fulfilled them
while he rode that train of song
his devils tagged along
the whiskey and the pills
just couldn't kill him
he didn't mean to be a rebel
ah, the real ones never do
they're born apart from ordinary men
now somewhere he is smiling
on those who sanctified him
but would they even recognize him
if he came back again?
it's an old familiar story
but it's a damn shame none the less
they don't forgive his kind
till they lay them down to rest
now somewhere he is smiling
on those who idolized him
but would they even recognize him
if he came back again?
oh, if he came back again"
"down a dangerous road,i have come to where i'm standing
with a heavy heart,and my hat clutched in my hand
such a foolish fool,god ain't known no greater sinner
i have come in search of jesus,hoping he will understand
i had a woman once,she was kind and she was gentle
had a child by me,who grew up to be a man
i had a steady job,til i started into drinking
and i started making music that went with the devil's band
oh the years flew by like a mighty rush of eagles
my dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
it's a lonesome life,when you lose the ones you live for
if i make my peace with jesus will they take me back again
if i give my soul,will he cleanse these clothes i'm wearin'
if i give my soul,will he put new boots on my feet
if i bow my head and beg god for his forgiveness
will he breathe new breath inside me and give back my dignity
if i give my soul,will he stop my hands from shaking
if i give my soul,will my son love me again
if i give my soul,and she knows i really mean it
if i give my soul to jesus will she take me back again
if i give my soul to jesus will she take me back again"

when he told you goodbye when he told you goodbye
there's just one thing for certain the pain won't stop hurtin'
till you go back to workin' with something left that you love
because the push and the shove of the everyday day now has become such a hassle
and your only dream castle disappeared in the sky when he told you goodbye

they'll be taken right now cause it ain't nothing new babe"

"well a man walked down by galilee so the holy book does say
and a great multitude was gathered there without a thing to eat for days
up stepped a little boy with the basket please take it lord he said
and with just a five loaves and two little fishes five thousand had fish and bread

now pay close attention little children it's somebody you ought to know
it's all about a man that walked on earth nearly two thousand years ago

then they nailed him on an old rugged cross and put thorns on his head
who was it everybody...
well they took him down and they buried him and after the third day
when they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone
cause the stone was rolled away
he's not here for he is risen the angel of the lord then said
and when they saw him walking with these nail scared hands
they knew he came back from the dead
who was it everybody..."

"i was a stumble bummin' down the neon music city sidewalks
with the junkie and the juicehead who had problems of their own
stuck with luck it kept me standin' just a step away from starvin'
and the talent that i swore i'd show before i'd go back home
ninety days i looked the army makin' neither love nor money
and my only set of clothes was gettin' closer to the bone
and the junkie placed an order with the prophet on the corner
and he told him of the soul that he'd been sellin' for a song
he said my future was my fortune but i let it slip away
slowly smokin' myself broke on eighty cigarettes a day
findin' out that crime ain't all there is that doesn't pay
and writin' words that no one's gonna see but did you said it who said it
i can read my fortune in the bottom of a glass
and i can see it's time for me to make my last request
won't you fill my grave with whiskey when i'm laid away to rest
so the boys can say i drank myself to dead
well i drank the whole thing over puttin' one and two together
and it added up to more of what i didn't want to be
i ain't blamin' music city but it's only gonna see me
one more day and the wake up and the time it takes to leave
cause i got a dirty picture of what could have been my future
in a prophet pushin' day dreams on a corner for a fee
and the wino lookin' lonely at a bottle gettin' empty
and a hungry lookin' junkie huntin' tea in sympathy
and i bet that junkie's laughin' after the life he threw away
slowly smokin' himself broke on eighty cigarettes a day
pleadin' down the prophet to a price that he can pay
and writin' words that no one's gonna see but did you said it who said it
every empty bottle is my private crystal ball
and starin' into the future findin' nothin' there at all
which is what i'll miss tomorrow when the neon shadows fall
on the junkie and the juicehead minus me"

i dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war
i dreamed i saw a mighty room filled with women and men
and the paper they were signing said they’d never fight again
and when the paper was all signed and a million copies made
they all joined hands and bowed their heads
and grateful pray’rs were prayed
and the people in the streets below were dancing ’round and ’round
while swords and guns and uniforms were scattered on the ground
last night i had the strangest dream i’d never dreamed before
i dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war"

let her keep making believing as long as she can
now and again i still hear some old songs i don't want to

sometimes at night i still wake up and feel something missing
maybe i'll never believe in forever again

i buy you anything that you want in town
if you leave that junk alone and drink water
lord that liquor is hard drink water
you don't wanna be assault
you better lay down the bottle
and put it on the top and drink

"let him roll, boys let him roll
i bet he's gone to dallas rest his soul
now he was a wino, tried and true
done about everything there is to do
he worked on freighters, he worked in bars
he worked on farms, 'n he worked on cars
now it was white port whine, that put that look in his eye
that grown men get when they need to cry
and we sat down on the curb to rest
and his head just fell down on his chest
he said ""every single day it gets
just a little bit harder to handle and yet...""
then he lost the thread and his mind got cluttered
the words just rolled off down in the gutter
he was a elevator man in a cheap hotel
in exchange for the rent on a one room cell
and he's years old before his time
no thanks to the world, and the white port wine
and he said ""son"", he always called me son
he said, ""life for you has just begun""
and then he told me the story that i heard before
how he fell in love with a dallas whore
he could cut through the years to the very night
that it all ended, in a whore house fight
and she turned his last proposal down
in favor of being a girl about town
now it's been seventeen years right in line
and he ain't been straight none of the time
it's too many years of fightin' the weather
and too many nights of not being together
so he died...
let him roll, boys let him roll
i bet he's gone to dallas rest his soul
let him roll, boys let him roll
he always thought that heaven
was just a dallas whore
when they went through his personal affects
in among the stubs from the welfare checks
was a crumblin' picture of a girl in a door
an address in dallas, and nothin' more
well the welfare people provided the priest
and a couple from the mission down the street
sang amasing grace, and nobody cried
'cept some lady in black way off to the side
we all left and she's standing there
the black veil covering her silver hair
and one eyed john said her name was alice
she used to be a whore in dallas
let him roll, boys let him roll
i bet he's gone to dallas rest his soul
let him roll, boys let him roll
he always thought that heaven
was just a dallas whore
let him roll, boys let him roll"
"well i've been in love,
but now i'm waiting

truth is so painful tell me a lie let me down easy and i'll get by
let me down easy for old time's sake
is it too much to ask when my heart's gonna break
i'm bound to lose you i'm bound to cry oh let me down easy and i'll get by

"brightly beams our father's mercy from his lighthouse evermore
but to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore

eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore
(let the lower lights be burning..."
"i don't want no aggravation
when my train has left the station
if you're there or not,
i may not even know
have a round and remember
things we did that weren't so tender
let the train blow the whistle when i go
on my guitar sell tickets
so someone can finally pick it
and tell the girls down at the ritz
i said hello
tell the gossipers and liars
i will see them in the fire
let the train blow the whistle when i go
let her blow, let her blow
long and loud and hard and happy
let her blow no regrets, all my debts will be paid
when i get laid let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
you'll be left without excuses
for the evils and abuses
down to today from years and years ago
and have yourself another toke
from my basket full of smoke
and let the train blow the whistle when i go
let her blow, let her blow
long and loud and hard and happy
let her blow no regrets, all my debts will be paid
when i get laid let her blow, let her blow, let her blow"
"with the twilight colors falling
and the evening laying shadows
hidden memories come stealing from my mind
as i feel my own heart beating out
the simple joy of living
i wonder how i ever was that kind
but the wild road i was rambling
was always out there calling
and they said a hundred times i should have died
but now my present miracle
is that you're here beside me so,
i believe they were roads that i was meant to ride
like a soldier getting over the war
like a young man getting over his crazy days
like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
every day is better than before
i'm like a soldier getting over the war
there were nights i don't remember
and there's pain that i've forgotten
other things i choose not to recall
there are faces that come to me
in my darkest secret memory
faces that i wish would not come back at all
in my dreams parade of lovers
from the other times and places
there's not one that matters now, no matter who
i'm just thankful for the journey
and that i've survived the battles
and that my spoils of victory are you"
"it should be a while before i see dr. death
so it would sure be nice if i could get my breath
well i'm not the crying nor the whining kind
'till i hear the whistle of the 309
of the 309, of the 309
put me in my box on the 309
take me to the depot, put me to bed
blow an electric fan on my gnarly old head
everybody take a look, see i'm doing fine
then load my box on the 309
on the 309, on the 309
put me in my box on the 309
hey sweet baby, kiss me hard
draw my bath water, sweep my yard
give a drink of my wine to my jersey cow
i wouldn't give a hootin' hell for my journey now
on the 309, on the 309
i hear the sound of a railroad train
the whistle blows and i'm gone again
it will take me higher than a georgia pine
stand back children, it's a 309
it's a 309, it's a 309
put me in my box on the 309
a chicken in the pot and turkey in the corn
ain't felt this good since jubilee morn
talk about luck, well i got mine
as me comin' down like a 309
write me a letter, sing me a song
tell me all about it, what i did wrong
meanwhile i will be doing fine
then load my box on the 309
on the 309, on the 309
goin' to get out of here on the 309"
"come they told me our newborn king to see
our finest gifts we bring to lay before the king
this is to honor him when we come
baby jesus i am a poor boy too i have no gift to bring that's fit to give a king
but may i play for you on my drum
the mother mary nodded the ox and lamb kept time
i played my drum for him i played my best for him
then he smiled at me me and my drum"
"my pappy said when i was seventeen you're six feet tall and your face is clean

never get rich for to save my soul and forty 'leven years a loadin' coal loadin' coal
ain't never got acquainted with a dollar bill and i don't ever reckon that i ever will
a dollar ain't made for a fellar i'm told that scoops up a livin' loadin' coal
loadin' coal loadin' coal...
i cussed everything in the mining camp from a shovel and my pick to my carbide lamp
but i know mighty well till i grow old i'll still be a cussin' but loadin' coal
loadin' coal loadin' coal...
i know just as well as coal is black one of these days the mines were strike

"i got a gal in dallas, i wave at when i go through
i got a gal in tulsa, that i toot my whistle to
i got 'em all over the land, i'm a locomotive man
left my heart in omaha omaha, and i never did quite get it back
i got a sue in sioux city, waitin' by the railroad track
i got 'em all over the land, i'm a locomotive man
well, i left a little switch engine,
'bout forty miles south of bangor maine
couldn't keep the wheels a turnin',
shouldn't try to pull my train
i got 'em all over the land, i'm a locomotive man
well, i had a gal in jackson,
and it sure broke my heart to turn her loose
when i checked my time and moved on,
she's hooked on my caboose
i got 'em all over the land, i'm a locomotive man"
"on the park bench i slept on raindrops are fallin'
on the newspapers coverin' me
i hear early morning motors
and i know the world is waking for the dawn
but my mind's down in dark alley somewhere
where last night you loved me
and in the early morning chill
my arms remember still
but i'm droppin' like a stone
lonesome to the bone
the sun is roughly rising
on the roofs of stagger town
the time for sweatin' poison out
is just now comin' round
the high time of last midnight
is over with and gone
leaving me lonesome to the bone
i walked away the wind blows and any way
the wind goes will be good enough for me
the streets are loud and crowded
but i walk my weary way lost and alone
your hot breath and your laughter keep flashing
through my mind to warm me
but the naked light of day soon makes it fade away
and i'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone
the sun is roughly rising..."
"everybody's got to walk this lonesome valley
we've got to walk it by ourselves
there's nobody here can walk it for us
we've got to walk it by ourselves

he's got to walk it by his self
there's nobody here can walk it for him
he's got to walk it by his self
my mother's got to walk this lonesome valley
she's got to walk it by herself
there's nobody here can walk it for her
she's got to walk it by herself

"ten years ago, on a cold dark night
someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
there were few at the scene, but they all agreed
that the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me
the judge said son, what is your alibi
if you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
i spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
for i'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
chorus
she walks these hills in a long black veil
she visits my grave when the night winds wail
nobody knows, nobody sees
nobody knows but me
oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
she stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
but late at night, when the north wind blows
in a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones
repeat chorus"
"well i'm gonna start out walkin' just you wait and see
uh huh guitar picker you ain't leavin' without me
oh you big mouth woman you long legged guitar pickin' man
but we can work this out uh huh yes ma'm i think we can
well i stole the hope diamond hopin' i could shut your mouth
but how am i gonna wear it if i got to hide it out
well you big mouth woman...
well i bought you a first class ticket for a luxury liner cruise
i got out in that ocean looked around and there was you
oh you big mouth woman...
i bought you a big long limousine but i don't want no car
i gave my love and everything but you're still what you are
you're just a big mouth woman...
oh honey i love that big sweet mouth you a long legged guitar pickin' man
ha ha i'm gonna pick it for you now you a nice guitar pickin' man"
"the years creep slowly by, lorena,
the snow is on the grass again;
the sun's low down the sky, lorena,
the frost gleams where the flowers have been.
but my heart beats on as warmly now,
as when the summer days were nigh;
the sun can never dip so low,
or down affections cloudless sky.
a hundred months have passed, lorena,
since last i held that hand in mine,
and felt the pulse beat fast, lorena,
though mine beat faster far than thine.
a hundred months, 'twas flowery may,
when up the hilly slope we climbed,
to watch the dying of the day,
and hear the distant church bells chime.
we loved each other then, lorena,
more than we ever dared to tell;
and what we might have been, lorena,
had but our lovings prospered well.
but then, 'tis past, the years are gone,
i'll not call up their shadowy forms;
i'll say to them, ""lost years, sleep on!
sleep on! nor heed life's pelting storms.""
the story of that past, lorena,
alas! i care not to repeat,
the hopes that could not last, lorena,
they lived, but only lived to cheat.
i would not cause e'en one regret
to rankle in your bosom now;
for ""if we try, we may forget,""
were words of thine long years ago.
yes, these were words of thine, lorena,
they burn within my memory yet;
they touched some tender chords, lorena,
which thrill and tremble with regret.
'twas not thy woman's heart that spoke;
thy heart was always true to me:
a duty, stern and pressing, broke
the tie which linked my soul with thee.
it matters little now, lorena,
the past is in the eternal past;
our heads will soon lie low, lorena,
life's tide is ebbing out so fast.
there is a future! o, thank god!
of life this is so small a part!
'tis dust to dust beneath the sod;
but there, up there, 'tis heart to heart."
"a burnin' hot sun a cryin' for water black wings circle the sky
stumblin' and fallin' somebody's callin' you're lost on the desert to die
i had to give up and they took me to jail but i hid all the money i got
way out on the desert where no one could get it and i left a mark at the spot
then i got away and i ran for the desert the devil had taken control
i needed water but he said i'd make it near the money is a big waterhole
a burnin' hot sun...
just up ahead is where i left my mark or it may be to the left or the right
i've been runnin' all day and they'll catch up tomorrow i've got to find it tonight
then up jumped the devil and ran away laughin' he drank all the waterholes dry
he moved my mark till i'm running in circles and lost on the desert to die
a burnin' hot sun...
 lost on the desert to die "
"i guess we're over and it's all been said before
but i still want you though there's no reason anymore
i can't remember when you and i began
it makes no difference cause love has lost again
if there's a reason we forgot it long ago
and if there's an answer it's one i'll never know
the price of giving i just don't understand
but it's collected and love has lost
again
all that's left now is the closing of the door
it sounds so final but i don't listen anymore
it's not the last time that i'll break instead of bend
but for the moment love has lost again"
"i have been a rover
i have walked alone
hiked a hundred highways
never found a home
still in all i'm happy
the reason is, you see
once in a while along the way
love's been good to me
there was a girl in denver
before the summer storm
oh, her eyes were tender
oh, her arms were warm
and she could smile away the thunder
kiss away the rain
even though she's gone away
you won't hear me complain
i have been a rover
i have walked alone
hiked a hundred highways
never found a home
still in all i'm happy
the reason is, you see
once in a while along the way
love's been good to me
there was a girl in portland
before the winter chill
we used to go a courtin'
along october hill
and she could laugh away the dark clouds
cry away the snow
it seems like only yesterday
as down the road i go
i've been a rover
i have walked alone
hiked a hundred highways
never found a home
still in all i'm happy
the reason is, you see
once in a while along the way
love's been good to me"
"i lived on a farm out in iowa i pulled the corn and i worked in the hay
got trapped by a girl but i wiggled free heard the oregon timber callin' me
will you tell me somethin' mr lumberjack is it one for forward and three for back
is it two for stop or four for go boy ask a whistle punk i don't know
well i learned this fact from a logger named ray you don't cut timber on a windy day
stay out of the woods when the moisture's low
or you ain't gonna live to collect your doe
will you tell me somethin'...
well you work in the woods from morning till night
you laugh and sing and you cuss and fight
on saturday night you go to eugene's and on a sunday morning your pockets are clean
will you tell me somethin'..."
"i met a girl out in a town that tore all my resistance down
i thought what a dream this oughta be
i went with her a month or two and like any boy in love will do
asked her if she would marry me
but she was a mama's baby, mama's baby
though she loved me like she never loved another
she was a mama's baby, mama's baby
and she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
then i said well then probably the only thing that's left for me
is to go and come back in a year or so
a year passed away and then i tried to win her hand again
she even packed her clothes but she wouldn't go
cause she was a mama's baby, mama's baby
though she loved me like she never loved another
she was a mama's baby, mama's baby
and she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
well i hung around till finally i persuaded her to marry me
her mother said that it would be all right
we bought ourselves a little home and i finally got her off alone
but she stays with her mother every night
cause she was a mama's baby, mama's baby
though she loved me like she never loved another
she was a mama's baby, mama's baby
and she said that she just couldn't leave her mother"
"when you wake up
in the morning
baby look
inside your mirrow
i won't be next to you
you know i won't be near
i'd be curious to know
if you can see yourself
as clear
as someone
that i've got on my mind
mama
you've been on my mind
well, perhaps it's the wind
and the dark
dark night that's covering
the crossroads that i'm at
and maybe it's the weather
somethin' like that
but mama
you've been on my mind
mama
you've been on my mind
well
i don't need trouble
please don't put me down
i am not pleading
i won't say i'll forget
and i won't pace a floor
bout down
and bent but yet
mama
you've been on my mind
even though
my mind is hazy
and my thoughts
where might be narrow
where you been
don't bother me
or bring me down
with sorrow
it don't matter to me
where you
waking up tomorrow
but mama
you've been on my mind
mama
you've been on my mind
mama
you've been on my mind"
"well, you wonder why i always dress in black,
why you never see bright colors on my back,
and why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
well, there's a reason for the things that i have on.
i wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
i wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
but is there because he's a victim of the times.
i wear the black for those who never read,
or listened to the words that jesus said,
about the road to happiness through love and charity,
why, you'd think he's talking straight to you and me.
well, we're doin' mighty fine, i do suppose,
in our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
but just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
up front there ought 'a be a man in black.
i wear it for the sick and lonely old,
for the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
i wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
each week we lose a hundred fine young men.
and, i wear it for the thousands who have died,
believen' that the lord was on their side,
i wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
believen' that we all were on their side.
well, there's things that never will be right i know,
and things need changin' everywhere you go,
but 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
you'll never see me wear a suit of white.
ah, i'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
and tell the world that everything's ok,
but i'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
'till things are brighter, i'm the man in black."
"was on one cold winter's night
and the wind blew across the wild moor
poor mary came wand'ring with a child in her arms
and she stopped at her own father's door.
oh, father, oh father, she cried
come down and open the door
or this child in my arms, will perish and die
from the winds that blow across the wild moor.
oh why did i leave this fair spot
where once i was happy and free
this wide world to roam, with no friends or no home
and no one to have pity on me.
but the father was deaf to her cry
not the sound of her voice, did he hear
for the watch dogs did howl and the village bells tolled
and the winds blew across the wild moor.
oh, how the old man must have felt
when he opened the door, the next morn'
and found mary dead, but the child still alive
clasped close in it's dead mother's arms.
in anguish, he pulled his gray hair
and the tears, down his cheeks, they did pour
when he saw how that night, they had perished and died
from the winds that blow across the wild moor.
the old man, his life, pined away
and the child, to it's mother, went soon
and no one they say, lives there to this day
and the old house, to ruin, has gone.
but the villagers point out the spot
and the willows droop over the door
where poor mary died, once a sweet village bride
from the winds that blow across the wild moor."
"the crowd is waiting for the bullfight
matador
my final fight the place is packed once more
anita won't throw me a rose this fight
the one she wears is not for me tonight
she's watching now with her new love i know
walk proud and slow
be strong and sure give the crowd their show
they want blood you know!
you're still their idol as you were before
kill just one more!
remind anita, you're the greatest matador
walk on out, forget anita in the stands
be a tall and brave and noble man
be better than you've ever been before
make this you're greatest moment matador
she's watching now with her new love i know
walk proud and slow
be strong and sure give the crowd a show
they want blood you know!
you're still their idol as you were before

remind anita, you're the greatest matador"
"i heard on the radio there's rumors of war
people getting ready for battle
and there may be just one more
i heard about an earthquake
and the toll it took away
these are the signs of the times we're in today.
chorus
matthew twenty four is knocking at the door,
and there can't be too much more to come to pass.
matthew twenty four is knocking at the door,
and a day or one more could be the last.
a great bear from the northland has risen from his sleep,
and the army ranks in red are near two hundred million deep.
the young and old now prophesy a coming
prince of peace
and last night i dreamed of lightning in the east.
repeat chorus"
"busted flat in baton rouge
headin for the trains
feelin nearly faded as my jeans
bobby thumbed a diesel down
just before it rained
took us all the way to new orleans
then i took my harpoon
out of my dirty red bandana
and was blowin sad while bobby sang the blues
with them windshield wipers
flappin' time and bobby's hand in mine
we finally sang up every song that driver knew
freedoms just another word for
nothin' left to lose
and nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
feelin' good was easy, lord
while bobby sang the blues
feelin' good was good enough for me
good enough for me and bobby mcgee
from the coalmines of kentucky
to the california sun
bobby shared the secrets of my soul
standin' right beside me, lord
through everythin i done
and every night she kept me from the cold
and then one day near salinas, lord
i let her slip away
lookin' for the home, i hope she'll find
and i'd trade all my tomorrows
for one single yesterday
holdin' bobby's body close to mine
freedom's just another word for
nothin left to lose
and nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
feelin' good was easy
while bobby sang the blues
and feelin' good was good enough for me
good enough for me and bobby mcgee"
"i give my woman half my money at the general store i said, ""now buy a little groceries, and don't spend no more."" but she gave ten dollars for a ten cent hat and bought some store bought cat food for a mean eyed cat.
when i give her ten more dollars for a one way ticket she was mad as she could be then i bet ten more that if she ever left she'd come a crawlin' back to me when i woke up this mornin' and i turned my head there wasn't a cotton pickin' thing on her side of the bed i found a little old note where her head belonged it said, ""dear john, honey, baby, i'm long gone.""
when i heard a whistle blowin', and the big wheels a turnin' i was scared as i could be i put on my overalls and i headed to town gonna bring her back with me.
i asked the man down at the station if he'd seen her there i told him all about her pretty eyes and long, blonde hair he spit his tobacco, said, ""i'll be dad blamed...... i believe i did see her leavin' on the east bound train.""
i bought a round trip ticket on the east bound train i was broke as i could be but when i come back, gotta buy another ticket gotta bring her back with me.
well, i got off the train somewhere in arkansas and i worked up the guts to call my mother in law she said, ""i'll tell you where she is, if you act right."" ""she's workin' four to twelve at trucker's world tonight.""
when i walked in she saw me, and she took off her apron and she grabbed her goin' home hat she bought a ticket with her tips and now we're curled up on the sofa, me and her....and that mean eyed cat"
"we saw houses falling from the sky where the mountains lean down to the sand we saw blackbirds circling 'round an old castle keep and i stood on the cliff and held your hand
we walked troubles brooding wind swept hills and we loved and we laughed the pain away at the end of the journey, when our last song is sung will you meet me in heaven someday
 can't be sure of how's it's going to be when we walk into the light across the bar but i'll know you and you'll know me out there beyond the stars
we've seen the secret things revealed by god and we heard what the angels had to say should you go first, or if you follow me will you meet me in heaven someday
living in a mansion on the streets of gold at the corner of grace and rapture way in sweet ecstasy while the ages roll will you meet me in heaven someday
in sweet ecstasy while the ages roll will you meet in heaven someday"
"take one fresh and tender kiss
add one stolen night of bliss
one girl, one boy, some grief, some joy
memories are made of this.
don't forget a small moonbeam
fold it lightly with a dream
your lips and mine to sip the wine
memories are made of this
then at the wedding bells
one house where lovers dwell
three little kids for the flavor
stir carefully through the day
see how the flavor stays
these are the dreams that we must savor
with his blessings from above
serve it generously with love
one man, one wife, one love for life
memories are made of this"
"it all began when they took me from my home
and put me on death row,
a crime for which i am totally innocent, you know.
i began to warm and chill
to objects and their fields,
a ragged cup, a twisted mop
the face of jesus in my soup
those sinister dinner deals
the meal trolley's wicked wheels
a hooked bone rising from my food
and all things either good or ungood.
and the mercy seat is waiting
and i think my head is burning
and in a way i'm yearning
to be done with all this weighing of the truth.
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
and anyway i told the truth
and i'm not afraid to die.
i hear stories from the chamber
christ was born into a manger
and like some ragged stranger
he died upon the cross
might i say it seems so fitting in its way
he was a carpenter by trade
or at least that's what i'm told
my kill hand's tatooed e.v.i.l.
across it's brother's fist
that filthy five!
they did nothing to challenge or resist.
in heaven his throne is made of gold
the ark of his testament is stowed
a throne from which i'm told
all history does unfold.
it's made of wood and wire
and my body is on fire
and god is never far away.
into the mercy seat i climb
my head is shaved, my head is wired
and like a moth that tries
to enter the bright eye
i go shuffling out of life
just to hide in death awhile
and anyway i never lied.
and the mercy seat is waiting
and i think my head is burning
and in a way i'm yearning
to be done with all this weighing of the truth.
an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth
and anyway i told the truth
and i'm not afraid to die.
and the mercy seat is burning
and i think my head is glowing
and in a way i'm hoping
to be done with all this twisting of the truth.
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
and anyway there was no proof
and i'm not afraid to die.
and the mercy seat is glowing
and i think my head is smoking
and in a way i'm hoping
to be done with all these looks of disbelief.
a life for a life and a truth for a truth
and i've got nothing left to lose
and i'm not afraid to die.
and the mercy seat is smoking
and i think my head is melting
and in a way that's helping
to be done with all this twisting of the truth.
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
and anyway i told the truth
but i'm afraid i told a lie."
"we were gathered 'round the garbage can passin' round the bottle,
we were cold and burning anything, that was dry enough to burn.
a shakin' man said he had left his family back in boston,
and i knew i'd hear a whole lot more, before it came my turn.
a bearded man in his army coat said the answer boys is jesus,
the one called joe said all i know is ain't january hell?
one guy said let's have a drink to flagstaff arizona?
and i thought i might freeze to death before id get to tell.
?bout mobile bay , magnolia blossoms. cool summer nights
warm rollin' seas. and all my dreams, somewhere i'd lost 'em,
mobile bay, magnolia leaves, sweet rosalee.
the sun was barely comin' up on the wrong side of chicago
and i was cold and hungry and all the wine was gone.
people passed and pointed, said ?there's another wino?.
they didn't know that one more time
my dreams would take me home.
back to, mobile bay, magnolia blossoms. cool summer nights
warm rollin' seas. and all my dreams, somewhere i'd lost 'em,
mobile bay, magnolia leaves, sweet rosalee.
mobile bay. magnolia blossoms, cool summer nights

"there's a stretch of highway on interstate 24 between
nashville and chattanooga
that's claimed many trucker's life
and your life is in your hands
when you start down that long steep grade
on monteagle mountain
i just rolled out of nashville in my big rig headin' south
my eyes are on fire feels like cotton in my mouth
my whole body's achin' but i got to make them big wheels roll
i got to be in florida by tomorrow morning with a full heavy load
i got to get passed atlanta as soon as i can tonight
i got to try to dodge the scales and stay out of smoky's sight
but there's one big thing standin' like a nightmare in my way
i got to top monteagle mountain a little bit later today
goin' down monteagle mountain on i 24
it's hell for a trucker when the decil's at your door
he'll tempt you and tell you come on let her roll
cause the mountain wants your rig and trucker i want your soul
when i started down monteagle the brakes just wouldn't hold
i knew i was in trouble and bout to lose control
the runaway ramp was waitin' i saw the warnin' sign
i said lord help me make it have mercy on this soul of mine
well i ploughed into that runaway ramp and
i could feel that bigh truck groan
my life flashed right before my eyes and for a minute
i thought i was gone
but when the smoke cleared i thanked god that i was still alive
cause when there's a runaway on monteagle
some truckers don't survive
goin' down monteagle mountain...
yeah many a good man had lost his life
on monteagle mountain it's a long steep grade
many a good hard workin' boy gone
over the side watch out for monteagle"
"mr garfield been shot down shot down shot down
mr garfield been shot down low
me and my brother was down close to the depot when
i heard the report of a pistol
my brother run out and come back in all excited
and i said what was it and he said it was the report
of a pistol and then he said
mr garfield been shot down shot down shot down
mr garfield been shot down low
lord i knew the president was supposed to be
at the depot that day
and we just would't believe that he's shot
but we'd run over there and there was so many folks around
that we couldn't see him but some lady was standin' there cryin'
and i said m'am what was it that happened m'am and she said
mr garfield been shot down shot down shot down
mr garfield been shot down low
well everybody drifted off toward home finally
and they looked like they felt about as bad as i did
but in a few weeks i heard that the president was still alive
and i told my brother i said let's get on that
train and go to where he's laid up hurt
well when we got to his big house up there i asked the fellow
i said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the president
and he said it was charlie guiteau that shoot mr garfield and
i said
charlie guiteau done shot down a good man good man
charlie guiteau done shot down a good man low
i heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see
the president
and i sidled up him to listen to what he was tellin' and he said
mrs lucretia garfield was always at his side
in the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot
he said that just that day the president said to mrs lucretia
he said crete honey said if somethin' worse happens to me after
awhile you get yourself a good man
and mrs lucretia said james she said i won't hear to that now she said
i love you too much but he said
you'll make some good man a good wife good wife
you'll make some man a good good good wife
(don't pull in single harness all your life good gal
don't pull in single harness all your life)
that's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life
well a few days later i come back
to where the president was restin'
and it seems everybody was cryin'
the flag was hangin' halfway up to the flagpole
in front of the house
and everybody looked so sad and i asked a soldier boy there
and i said is is is mr garfield and he said yeah he's gone
gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low
gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground
well they laid the president by that long cold branch
mr garfield's been laid down low
mr garfield has been shot dow mr garfield's been shot
(mr garfield been shot down shot down shot down
mr garfield been shot down low)"
"i've got no fire inside of me can't be the man i try to be
oh mr lonesome hanging round
don't wanna see nobody don't wanna be nobody
oh mr lonesome got me down
he makes me leave the party when folks are laughin' hearty
happiness is one thing he can't stand
nobody wants or needs me i go just where he leads me
oh mr lonesome got my hand
and so my whole life over each day is like the other but still if my one wish could be
if that old chain that binds me breaks when true love finds me
and mr lonesome sets me free oh mr lonesome got me down"
"i pray to feel more joy in my salvation
a selfish prayer, i finally came to know
for the greatest joy, while livin', comes to me when i am giving
giving children bread of life and watch them grow
and my greatest joy is knowing that my children walk in truth
and that they are giving you, lord, of their fire
and strength of youth
yes, i found the greatest joy in my salvation
is knowing that my children walk in truth
it's hard to feed someone else when you're hungry
and don't try to teach when you don't understand
no one will follow you if you don't live it each day through
and a frightened child won't hold a trembling hand
and my greatest joy is knowing that my children walk in truth
and that they are giving you, lord, of their fire and strength of youth
yes, i found the greatest joy in my salvation
is knowing that my children walk in truth"
"there are some things i may not know there are some places i can't go
but i am sure of this one thing my god is real for i can feel him in my soul
my god is real real in my soul my god is real for he has washed and made me whole
his love for me is like pure gold my god is real for i can feel him in my soul
some folks may doubt some folks may scorn
well they can all go on just leave me alone
but ask for me i'll take god's part my god is real for i can feel him in my heart
my god is real real..."
"my grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
so it stood ninety years on the floor
it was taller by half than the old man himself
though it weighed not a penniweight more
it was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
and was always his treasure and pride
but it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
ninety years without slumbering his life second's numbering
it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
my grandfather said that of those he could hire
not a servant so faithful he found
for it wasted no time and had but one desire
at the close of each week to be wound
and it kept in its place not a frown upon its face
and its hands never hung by its side
but it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
it rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
an alarm that for years had been dumb
and we knew that his spirit was plumbing for flight
that his hour for departure had come
still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
as we silently stood by his side
but it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
ninety years without slumbering..."
"i saved a lot of money my fortune was untold
and like a fool i idealized my silver and my gold
my earthly treasure's mounted but when i counted through
i realized the treasure i had overlooked was you
my treasure unmeasured but forsaken of the treasures that come from above
my treasure unmeasured but it don't hold a heart of the one that i love
if i had my life before me if i could see it all
i'd stake my claim on things that are secured against downfall
i'd work for earthly treasures like any man would do
but i set my sights much higher and i'd be sure that i had you
my treasure unmeasured unmeasured..."
"nasty dan
nasty dan was the meanest man i ever knew
he's stomp and scream and be real mean the whole day through
he'd frown a bunch he ate nails for lunch and he'd never laugh
he'd growl and yell and i hard tell that he never took a bath
nasty dan was a nasty man
hard to understand that nasty dan
now nasty dan was a nasty man the whole day long
he'd go where he could he'd try real good to make things go wrong
he'd jump for joy when a little boy would trip and fall
and the only words that he ever said were i don't like you at all
nasty dan was a nasty man
hard to understand that nasty dan
now a real interesting thing that i want you to know about is this here
because it's the most important thing it concerns a girl and things like that
now nasty pearl was a nasty girl that met dan somehow
she said you like me rotten as can be let's get married now
so they went and they did and had a nasty kid
and i must confess that dan pretty much leaves everyone alone now
and he doesn't bother anybody anymore cause he just lives in his nasty ol' house
with his nasty ol' wife and his nasty ol' kid in nasty happiness
nasty dan was a nasty man
hard to understand that nasty dan"

coleman booner stood on the porch of that cabin

"t’was in the town of griffin
the year was eighty three
it was there an old cow puncher
stepped up and said to me
“how do you do young fellow?
and how would you like to go
and spend a pleasant summer
out in new mexico?”
“i’ll furnish you good wages
your transportation too
if you will but go with me
one summer season through”
“but if you should get homesick
and back to griffin go
then i’ll furnish you no horses
from the hills of mexico”
we left the town of griffin
in the merry month of may
when all the world was lovely
and everything was g**
with saddles on our horses
marching over we did go
until we reached the logging
out in new mexico
it was there our pleasures ended
and our troubles they began
the first hail storm fell on us
those cattle how they ran
through all the thorns and thistles
us cowboys had to go
while the indians watched upon us
out in new mexico
well when the drive was over
the riders would not pay
to all you happy people
this much i have to say
go back to your friends and loved ones
tell others not to go
to the god forsaken country
they call new mexico"

sometimes when i turn aside and guide me on that long, dim trail ahead that stretched upward toward the great divide

everything was milk and honey
oh, long walks by the river talkin' bout living together
oh, what a good thing we had, gone bad
oh, what a good thing we had
oh, what a good thing we had, gone bad
oh, what a good thing we had"

"old apache squaw, how many long lean years you saw?
how many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee?
shiverin' in a cold teepee
old apache squaw, how many hungry kids you saw?
how many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea, fleein' to the sea?
well, now they tell me that you saw cochise
when he made his last stand
he said, ""the next white man that sees my face
is gonna be a dead white man""
old apache squaw, how many broken hearts you saw?
have you had misty eyes for years?
could that mist be tears? could that mist be tears?
well, now they tell me that you saw cochise
when he made his last stand
he said, ""the next white man that sees my face
is gonna be a dead white man""
old apache squaw, how many broken hearts you saw?
you've had misty eyes for years
could that mist be tears? could that mist be tears?

"he was just an old country doctor in a little country town
fame and fortune had passed him by though we never saw him frown
as day by day in his kindly way he'd serve us one and all
many a patient forgot to pay although doc's fees were small
though he needed his dimes and there were times that he'd receive a fee
he'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he
he had to sell his furniture couldn't pay his office rent
so to a dusty room over a livery stable doc brown and his satchel went
and on the hitchin' post at the kerb below to advertise his wares
he nailed a little sign that read doc brown has moved upstairs
and one day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door
old doc brown was layin' down but his soul was no more
they found him there in that old black suit on his face was a smile of content
but all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent
so they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
beside each debtor's name old doc had write these words paid in full
old doc should had a funeral fine enough for a king
it's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing
cept jones an undertaker he did mighty well
donated an old iron casket he had never been able to sell
and the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and the style
but those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile
we wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one
cause he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done
we pulled up that old hitchin' post where doc had nailed a sign
we'd painted it white and to all of us it certainly did look fine
now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint
there ain't nothin' left but doc's own sign and that's gettin' pretty faint
but you can still see that old hitchin' post as if in answer to our prayers
mutually tellin' the whole wide world doc brown has moved upstairs"
"high on the mountain what do i see
there's bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
you better get your rifle boys before it's too late
that bear's got a little pig and headed for the gate
he's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
some folks say he looks a lot like me
well i got me some money and i got me some bees
and they started makin' honey way up in the trees
i chopped down the trees cause my honey's all gone
old slew foot's done made himself at home
he's bigger around the middle...
some folks say he looks a lot like daddy
winter's comin' on and it's forty below
the river's frozen over so where can he go
i'd get me a rifle boys and run him in the well
then i shoot him in the bottom just to hear him yell
he's bigger around the middle...
some folks say he looks a lot like my johnny"
"i heard the laughter at the depot
but my tears fell like the rain
when i saw them place that long white casket
in the baggage coach of the evening train
the baby's eyes are red from weeping
its little heart is filled with pain
oh daddy cried they're taking mama
away from us on the evening train
as i turned to walk away from the depot
it seemed i heard her call my name
take care of my baby and tell him darling
that i'm going home on the evening train
i pray that god will give me courage
to carry on 'til we meet again
it's hard to know she's gone forever
they're carrying her home on the evening train

"well, i left kentucky back in '49
an' went to detroit
workin' on a 'sembly line
the first year they had me puttin'
wheels on cadillacs
every day i'd watch them
beauties roll by
and sometimes i'd hang my head and cry
'cause i always wanted me
one that was long and black.
one day i devised myself a plan
that should be the envy of most any man
i'd sneak it out of there
in a lunchbox in my hand
now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
but i figured i'd have it all
by the time i retired
i'd have me a car worth
at least a hundred grand.
chorus
i'd get it one piece at a time
and it wouldn't cost me a dime
you'll know it's me
when i come through your town
i'm gonna ride around in style
i'm gonna drive everybody wild
'cause i'll have the only one there is a round.
so the very next day when i punched in
with my big lunchbox
and with help from my friends
i left that day with a lunch box
full of gears
now, i never considered myself a thief
gm wouldn't miss just one little piece
especially if i strung it out
over several years.
the first day
i got me a fuel pump
and the next day
i got me an engine and a trunk
then i got me a transmission
and all of the chrome
the little things i could get
in my big lunchbox
like nuts, an' bolts,
and all four shocks
but the big stuff we snuck
out in my buddy's mobile home.
now, up to now my plan went all right
'til we tried to put it
all together one night
and that's when we noticed
that something was definitely wrong.
the transmission was a '53
and the motor turned out to be a '73
and when we tried to put in the bolts
all the holes were gone.
so we drilled it out
so that it would fit
and with a little bit of help
with an a daptor kit
we had that engine runnin'
just like a song
now the headlight' was another sight
we had two on the left
and one on the right
but when we pulled out
the switch all three of 'em come on.
the back end looked kinda funny too
but we put it together
and when we got thru
well, that's when we noticed
that we only had one tail fin
about that time my wife walked out
and i could see in her eyes
that she had her doubts
but she opened the door
and said ""honey,
take me for a spin""
so we drove up town just to get the tags
and i headed her right on down main drag
i could hear everybody laughin'
for blocks around
but up there at the court house
they didn't laugh
'cause to type it up it
took the whole staff
and when they got through
the title weighed sixty pounds.
chorus
i got it one piece at a time
and it didn't cost me a dime
you'll know it's me
when i come through your town
i'm gonna ride around in style
i'm gonna drive everybody wild
'cause i'll have the only one
there is around.
 ugh! yow, red ryder
this is the cotton mouth
in the psycho billy cadillac come on
huh, this is the cotton mouth
and negatory on the cost
of this mow chine there red ryder
you might say i went right up to the factory
and picked it up, it's cheaper that way
ugh!, what model is it?
well, it's a '49, '50, '51,
'52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58' 59' automobile
it's a '60, '61, '62,
'63, '64, '65, '66, '67
'68, '69, '70 automobile."
"ow, you're off and runnin'
run just like you're scared
run just like a grey dog
run just like a deer
something in the bushes
starin' out at you
starin' at your feelings
feelin' like you do
one way rider
one way down the road
baby, i'm right beside you
everywhere you go
lovers save your secrets trust not into fools
don't go look for trouble it will come to you
like some long lost passage fly in broken lines
here in the fleeting moment really gone this time
one way rider
one way down the road
baby, i'm right beside you
everywhere you go
once upon a victim circumstance is due
tend to take a hold on everything you do
first we follow leaders
next we follow fools now we follow
footsteps sneakin' upon you
one way rider
one way down the road
baby i'm right beside you
everywhere you go
one way rider
one way down the road
baby, i'm right beside you
everywhere you go
sunday drivers only way to go
baby, i'm right beside you
everywhere you go"
"written by jerry chestnut
recorded by johnny cash on 6/5/72
number 2   county chart
i dedicate this song to the workin' man
for ever' man that puts in a hard
eight or ten hours a day of work and toil and sweat
always got somebody lookin' down his neck
tryin' to get more out of 'im
than he really ought to have to put in.
after twenty nine long years of workin'
in this shop with oney standin' over me ...
today when that old whistle blows
i'll check in all my gear and i'll retire ...
the superintendent just dropped by and said
they'd planned my little get together ...
then he said i'd never a made it
if old oney hadn't held me to the fire.
i've seen him in my dreams at night
and woke up in the mornin' feelin' tired ...
and old oney don't remember, when i came here
how he tried to get me fired ...
with his folded hands behind him
every mornin' oney waited at the gate ...
where he'd rant and rave like i committed murder
clockin' in five minutes late.
but today they'll gather 'round me
like i've seen 'em do when any man retires
then old oney's gonna tell me
from now on i'm free to do what i desire ...
he'll present me with that little old gold watch
they give a man at times like this ...
but there's one thing he's not countin' on
today's the day i give old oney his.
i've been workin', buildin' muscles
oney's just been standin' 'round a gettin' soft
and today about four thirty
i'll make up for every good night's sleep i've lost ...
when i'm gone i'll be remembered
as the workin' man who put his point across
with a right hand full of knuckles
'cause today i show old oney who's the boss.
hmmmm! what time is it? four thirty!
hey, oney!
oney! ha ha ha ha!"

or maybe californy
and get some sand in my shoes
i'll ride that orange blossom special

""say man, when you going back to florida?""
""when am i goin' back to florida? i don't know, don't reckon i ever will.""

"well, have you seen
my darkhaired girl?
she was set on her love
to a hungry world
they got her clothes
an the money she took
and they wrote her name
in the prison books

my darkhaired girl?
she's tired and cold
and you got the gold
she took
from a hungry world
orleans parish prison
won't you free
my darkhaired girl?
well have seen
my green eyed son?
he shot a man down
with a sawed off gun
and they fond him down
by the pontchartrain
where they cuffed his arms
with a big iron chain

won't you free me
green eyed son?
i heard him say
as you let him away
sorry for what he's done
orleans parish prison
won't you free me
green eyed son?

he took a little money
with a gun in his hand

"it's midnight at a liquor store in texas
closing time another day is done
when a boy walks in the door and points a pistol
he can't find a job but lord he's found a gun
he pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
that he lets the old man run out in the street
even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
already he can feel that great relief
oh how many travelers get wear y
bearing both their burdens and their scars
don't you think they'd love to start all over
and fly like eagles out among the stars
he pictures the arrival of the cruisers
sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
he knows that when they're shooting at this loser
they'll be aiming at the demons in their lives
oh how many travelers get wear y
bearing both their burdens and their scars
don't you think they'd love to start all over
and fly like eagles out among the stars
the evening news carries all the details
he dies in every living room in town
in his own a bottle's thrown in anger
and his father cries we'll never live this down
oh how many travelers get wear y
bearing both their burdens and their scars
don't you think they'd love to start all over
and fly like eagles out among the stars
and fly like eagles out among the stars"
"by the way the land is layin'
i think i'd be safe in sayin'
that over the next hill we'll be home
it's a straight and narrow highway
no detours and no by ways
and over the next hill we'll be home
from the prophets i've been hearin'
i would say the end is nearin'
for i see familiar landmarks all along
by the dreams that i've been dreamin'
there will come a great redeemin'
and over the next hill we'll be home
i would say there's no mistakin'
that over the next hill we'll be home
there's a place that we are nearin'
that so many have been fearin'
and over the next hill we'll be home
when we get there we're all hopin'
that we'll find the gate is open
and there'll be a refuge from the comin' storm
for the way's been long and weary
but at last the end is nearin'
and over the next hill we'll be home"
"but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
and give them all to me
you would lose them, i know how to use them
give them all to me
no use crying, talking to a stranger
naming the sorrows you've seen
'cause there's too many bad times, too many sad times
and nobody knows what you mean
but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
and give them all to me
you would lose them, i know how to use them
give them all to me
no use rambling, walking in the shadows
trailing a wandering star
no one beside you, no one to guide you
and nobody knows where you are
but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
and give them all to me
you would lose them, i know how to use them
give them all to me
no use roaming, walking by that roadside
seeking a satisfied mind
there's too many highways, too many byways
and nobody's walking behind
but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
and give them all to me
you would lose them, i know how to use them
give them all to me
you would lose them, i know how to use them
give them all to me"
"when i was a child my family would travel
down to western kentucky where my parents were born
and there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
so many times that my memories are worn
""and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""well, i'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
mister peabody's coal train has hauled it away""
well, sometimes we'd travel right down the green river
to the abandoned old prison down by adrie hill
where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
but empty pop bottles was all we would kill
""and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""well, i'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
mister peabody's coal train has hauled it away""
then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
and they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
then they wrote it all down as the progress of man
""and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""well, i'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
mister peabody's coal train has hauled it away""
when i die let my ashes float down the green river
let my soul roll on up to the rochester dam
i'll be halfway to heaven with paradise waitin'
just five miles away from wherever i am
""and daddy won't you take me back to muhlenberg county
down by the green river where paradise lay?""
""well, i'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
mister peabody's coal train has hauled it away"""
"in april of 1775
this great nation started comin' alive
ol' king george didn't look it one bit
so he proceeded to throw him a royal fit
he told his generals better get 'em back in line
make 'em pay my taxes now america is mine
stop that independence cops before it gets around
or it'll gonna be hard to hold them rebels down
well the king was talking bout the men like paul revere
and the minute men who held their dream of independence dear
they kept their eyes on the british they watched 'em day and night
they knew very soon they'd get their chance to stand and fight
yes they knew that the british would get movin' any hour
so they arranged a signal in the northern church tower
paul was watchin' when the tower showed a light
and he started on his midnight ride
he jumped on his horse hoofs started a hummin'
he screamed out his warning redcoats're comin'
better get your guns and your fightin' britches on
they're comin' and they're eight hundred strong
next mornin' at concord and lexington town
the spirit of freedom turned the redcoats around
when we praise the men who made this mighty nation we have here
then let's remember paul revere yes let's remember paul revere
i guarantee you somethin' and i wanna tell you all
that we never would've been here if it hadn't been for paul
yes sir i surely doubt us ever bein' here
if it hadn't been for that man on that horse named mr revere"

"aurora borealis
the icy sky at night
paddles cut the water
in a long and hurried flight
from the white man
to the fields of green
and the homeland
we've never seen.
they killed us in our tepee
and they cut our women down
they might have left some babies
cryin' on the ground
but the firesticks
and the wagons come
and the night falls
on the setting sun.
they massacred the buffalo
kitty corner from the bank
the taxis run across my feet
and my eyes have turned to blanks
in my little box
at the top of the stairs
with my indian rug
and a pipe to share.
i wish a was a trapper
i would give thousand pelts
to sleep with pocahontas
and find out how she felt
in the mornin'
on the fields of green
in the homeland
we've never seen.
and maybe marlon brando
will be there by the fire
we'll sit and talk about hollywood
and the good things there for hire
like the astrodome
and the first tepee
marlon brando, pocahontas and me

"a ship came in but it was empty
and it sailed back out to sea again
now there's the sail on the horizon
and now i wait until your ship comes in
and i'll be waiting in the port of lonely hearts
watchin' for your topsail on the sea
prayin' that my ship of love will come to the port
of lonely hearts where i will be
i'll brave the storm until you're with me
cause the wind and rain can't change a love that's true
i'll be alone until you anchor and then i'll leave this lonely port with you
till then i'm waiting in the port of lonely hearts..."
"out on a shrimp boat i just dropped the net

"by john r. cash, â© 1974 house of cash, inc.
i walked through a county courthouse square,
on a park bench an old man was sitting there.
i said, ""your old courthouse is kinda run down.""
he said, ""naw, it'll do for our little town.""
i said, ""your old flagpole has leaned a little bit,
and that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it.""
he said, ""have a seat,"" and i sat down.
""is this the first time you've been to our little town?""
i said, ""i think it is."" he said, ""i don't like to brag,
but we're kinda proud of that ragged old flag.
""you see, we got a little hole in that flag there when
washington took it across the delaware.
and it got powder burned the night francis scott key
sat watching it writing say can you see.
and it got a bad rip in new orleans
with packingham and jackson tuggin' at its seems.
""and it almost fell at the alamo
beside the texas flag, but she waved on though.
she got cut with a sword at chancellorsville
and she got cut again at shiloh hill.
there was robert e. lee, beauregard, and bragg,
and the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag.
""on flanders field in world war i
she got a big hole from a bertha gun.
she turned blood red in world war ii.
she hung limp and low by the time it was through.
she was in korea and vietnam.
she was sent where she was by her uncle sam.
""she waved from our ships upon the briny foam,
and now they've about quit waving her back here at home.
in her own good land here she's been abused   
she's been burned, dishonored, denied, and refused.
""and the government for which she stands
is scandalized throughout the land.
and she's getting threadbare and wearing thin,
but she's in good shape for the shape she's in.
'cause she's been through the fire before
and i believe she can take a whole lot more.
""so we raise her up every morning, take her
down every night.
we don't let her touch the ground and we fold
her up right.
on second thought, i do like to brag,
'cause i'm mighty proud of the ragged old flag."""

"if i listened long enough to you
i'd find the way to believe that it's all true
knowing that you lied straight face while i cried
still i'd looked to find the reason to believe

if i'd gave time to change my mind
i'd find the way to leave the past behind

"from the hands it came down
from the side it came down
from the feet it came down
and ran to the ground
between heaven and hell
a teardrop fell in the deep crimson dew
the tree of life grew
and the blood gave life
to the branches of the tree
and the blood was the price
that set the captives free
and the numbers that came
through the fire and the flood clung to the tree
and were redeemed by the blood
from the tree streamed a light
that started the fight 'round the tree grew a vine
on whose fruit i could dine
my old friend lucifer came
fought to keep me in chains
but i saw through the tricks
of six sixty six
and the blood gave life
to the branches of the tree
and the blood was the price
that set the captives free
and the numbers that came
through the fire and the flood clung to the tree
and were redeemed by the blood
from his hands it came down
from his side it came down
from his feet it came down
and ran to the ground
and a small inner voice said ""you do have a choice.""
the vine engrafted me
and i clung to the tree"
"i've wept for those who suffer long
but how i weep for those who've gone
into rooms of grief and questioned wrong
but keep on killing
it's in the soul to feel such things
but weak to watch without speaking

if god be willing
there is a train
that's heading straight to heaven's gate
to heaven's gate
and on the way, child and man and woman wait
watch and wait, for redemption day
fire rages in the streets
and swallows everything it meets
it's just an image often seen on television
come leaders, come you men of great
let us hear you pontificate
your many virtues laid to waste
and we aren't listening
what do you have for us today?
throw us a bone but save the plate
on why we waited til so late
was there no oil to excavate?
no riches in trade for the fate of
every person who died in hate?
throw us a bone, you men of great
there is a train
that's heading straight to heaven's gate
to heaven's gate
and on the way, child and man and woman wait
watch and wait, for redemption day
it's buried in the countryside
it's exploding in the shells at night
it's everywhere a baby cries

freedom. freedom"

the dug road the old reedy creek road

the dark and bloody ground as indians called it
indians wars were ragin' and men like daniel boone and michael stoner
came down the wilderness road like countless families did
through a place in south west virginia called big moccasin gap
it's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me
daniel boone lost his boy the other day young jim boone is dead twenty miles away
the wagons turn and went back home even daniel couldn't make it alone

rollin' where the urge tells him to go
and all this cowboy really needs is a tank of gas and entry fees
to get him to the next big rodeo

a cowboy don't need all that motern stuff

on caffine and nicotine

some where between the crazy and insane
cowboys ain't afraid pf dyin' shoot he'd even ride a red eyed lion
if you'd show him where to take the rein
now the only coach a cowboy needs
is a growlin' gut that says come on let's eat
so tonight cowboy you better make a winning ride

is that big gold buckle waitin' down the road

you heard someone say
if i had his money
i could do things my way
but little they know
that it’s so hard to find
one rich man in ten
with a satisfied mind
once i was waitin’
in fortune and fame
everything that i dreamed for
to get a start in life’s game
then suddenly it happened
i lost every dime
but i’m richer by far
with a satisfied mind
money can’t buy back
your youth when you’re old
or a friend when you’re lonely
or a love that’s grown cold
the wealthiest person
is a pauper at times
compared to the man
with a satisfied mind
when my life has ended
and my time has run out
my friends and my loved ones
i’ll leave there’s no doubt
but one thing’s for certain
when it comes my time
i’ll leave this old world

that it’s so hard to find

but spring could bring some glad tomorrow and darling we could be happy after all
as it is in nature's plan no season get the upper hand
how i try to keep this fact in mind
the trees are bare the cold wind blows and by experience we should know
winter comes but the spring is close behind
your leaving will bring...

and don't let them know i never will be free be free
sometimes write and tell me how they're doing

and send a picture of mother if you can

who'll be my fighting partner when you go when you go
the hardest time will be on sunday morning
church bells will ring on heaven hill heaven hill

and send a picture of mother if you will
say hello to dad and shake his poor hardworking hand
and send a picture of mother if you can"
"there's a cross above the baby's bed,
a saviour in her dreams.
but she was not delivered then,
and the baby became me.
there's a light inside the darkened room,
a footstep on the stair.
a door that i forever close,
to leave those memories there.
so when the shadows link them,
into an evening sun.
well first there's summer, then i'll let you in.
september when it comes.
i plan to crawl outside these walls,
close my eyes and see.
and fall into the heart and arms,
of those who wait for me.
i cannot move a mountain now;
i can no longer run.
i cannot be who i was then:
in a way, i never was.
i watch the clouds go sailing;
i watch the clock and sun.
oh, i watch myself, depending on,
september when it comes.
so when the shadows link them,
and burn away the clouds.
they will fly me, like an angel,
to a place where i can rest.
when this begins, i'll let you know,
september when it comes."

"i saw her through the window today
she was sitting in the silver spoon cafe
i started to keep going, but something made me stop
she used to love me a lot
she looked lonely, and i knew the cure
old memories would wear her heart for sure
i thought i'd walk on in, and i'd give it my best shot
she used to love me a lot
i sat down beside her and she smiled
she said ""where have you been? it's been a while""
she was glad to see me, i could almost read her thoughts
she used to love me a lot
she used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
looking at her now, i can't believe i said ""goodbye""
it would only take a minute to turn back the clock
she used to love me a lot
i remember how good it was back then
and i said ""it's not too late to start again""
we could spend the night together, take off where we left of
she used to love me a lot
but i panicked as she turned to walk away
as she went out the door, i heard her say
""yes, i'm in need of something, but something you ain't got
but i used to love you a lot""
i thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
looking at her now, i can't believe she said ""goodbye""
she just left me standing there, i've never been so shocked
she used to love me a lot
she used to love me a lot
she used to love me a lot
she used to love me a lot"
"well i think that i should tell you she's a go er
and when she goes she won't come back no more
there ain't nothing like it when you've got her all alone
and there's not anything that can replace her when she's gone
oh i envy you until the day she walks back out your door
and that she's gonna do cause she's a go er
now don't let her stay too long she'll take the heart right out of your song
you'll pay the price for her one time but she won't be back anymore
i just thought i'd tell you she's a go er
yes i guess i should have told you she's a go er
i should have told you that way back long before
but i was trying to overcome the pain she put me through
i was fightin' to forget her when she got around to you
oh you'll be heaven high till she don't want you anymore
then she'll be gone again cause she's a go er
now don't let her stay..."

"by johnny cash
well, i left my motel room, down at the starkville motel,
the town had gone to sleep and i was feelin' fairly well.
i strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees;
i was whistlin', pickin' flowers, swayin' in the southern breeze.
i found myself surrounded; one policeman said: ""that's him.
come along, wild flower child. don't you know that it's two a.m.""
they're bound to get you.
'cause they got a curfew.
and you go to the starkville city jail.
well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town;
i said: ""what the hell did i do?"" he said: ""shut up and sit down.""
well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks.
i said: ""wait, my name is..."" ""awe shut up."" well, i sure was in a fix.
the sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night;
i said: ""come back here, you so and so; i ain't bein' treated right.""
well, they're bound to get you, cause they got a curfew,
and you go to the starkville city jail.
i started pacin' back and forth, and now and then i'd yell,
and kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell.
i'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came.
then i sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name.
at 8 a.m. they let me out. i said: ""gimme them things of mine!""
they gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion.
they're bound to get you, 'cause they got a curfew,
and you go to the starkville city jail."

as i walked out on laredo one day,
i spied a poor cowboy wrapped in white linen,
wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.
""i can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy.""
these words he did say as i boldly walked by.
""come an' sit down beside me an' hear my sad story.

""then go write a letter to my grey haired mother,
""an' tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone.
""but please not one word of the man who had killed me.
""don't mention his name and his name will pass on.""
when thus he had spoken, the hot sun was setting.
the streets of laredo grew cold as the clay.
we took the young cowboy down to the green valley,
and there stands his marker, we made, to this day.
we beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,
played the dead march as we carried him along.

"well i woke up sunday morning
with no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
and the beer i had for breakfast wasn't bad,
so i had one more for dessert.
then i fumbled in my closet through my clothes
and found my cleanest dirty shirt.
then i washed my face and combed my hair
and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.
i'd smoked my mind the night before
with cigarettes and the songs i'd been pickin'
but i lit my first and watched a small kid
playin' with a can that he was kicking
then i walked across the street
and caught the sunday smell of someone's fryin'
chicken
and it took me back to somethin'
that i'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way.
chorus:
on a sunday morning sidewalk
i'm wishing lord that i was stoned
'cause there's something in a sunday
that makes a body feel alone.
and there's nothin' short of dyin'
that's half as lonesome as the sound
of a sleepin' city sidewalk
and sunday mornin' comin' down.
in the park i saw a daddy
with a laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
and i stopped beside a sunday school
and listened to the songs they were singin'
then i headed down the street
and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
and it echoed thru the canyon
like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.
repeat chorus"

tell all of my friends that i'm coming too coming for to carry me home

across the river called the rio grande raced my horse with the spaniard's foe
til i got me a skin full of silver and gold
me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
we got in a fight over tennessee pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
and i rode away on a tennessee stud
the tennessee stud was long and lean
the color of the sun and his eyes were green
he had the nerve and he had the blood
there was never a horse like the tennessee stud
i rode right back across arkansas
i whipped her brother and
i whipped her pa
i found that girl with the golden hair
she was riding on a tennessee mare
pretty little baby on the cabin floor
little horse colt playing round the door
i loved the girl with the golden hair
and the tennessee stud loves the tennessee mare
the tennessee stud was long and lean
the color of the sun and his eyes were green
he had the nerve and he had the blood
there was never a horse like the tennessee stud"
"you're tellin' everyone in town that i don't treat you right

"i sat at home friday last
waitin' for your call
thinkin' as the hours passed
were you worth it all
as the tears began to fill my head
it's then i thought to write instead
a hit song full a heartache
thanks to you
thanks to you
i'm gettin' the applause
thanks to you
and all the pain you caused
credit must go where credit is due
so i tip my hat and toast to you
for all the hits songs full a heartache
thanks to you
now days go by and weeks will pass
with not a word from you
i don't mind when people ask
how's you know who?
cause when the tears begin to fill my head
it's then i start to write instead
another hit song full a heartache
thanks to you"
"up in the mornin', out on the job
work like the devil for my pay.
but that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
but roll around heaven all day.
had a fuss with my woman, an' i toil for my kids,
an' i sweat 'til i'm wrinkled and gray,
while that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
but roll around heaven all day.
oh, lord above, don't you hear me cryin'
tears are rollin' down my eyes.
send in a cloud with a silver linin',
take me to paradise.
show me that river, take me across,
wash all my troubles away
like that lucky old sun give me nothing to do
but roll around heaven all day."
"that old wheel is gonna roll around once more
when it does it will even up the score
don't be weak: as they sew, they will reap
turn the other cheek and don't give in
that old wheel will roll around again
when love is gone and the one you thought would stay
does you wrong, and you're left alone to pay
the price is high
but somehow you'll survive, don't give in
that old wheel will roll around again
there'll be times, hard to control
and you'll find you'll hurt down in your soul
there'll be those who'll be glad to see you down
but don't give in, that old wheel will roll around again
roll around, around, again, again"
"in a vine covered
shack in the mountains
bravely fighting
the battle of time
there's a dear one
who's wept
through life's sorrows
it's that silver
haired daddy of mine
chorus :
if i couxd recall
all the heartaches
dear ole daddy
i've caused you to bear
if i could erase
those lines from your face
and bring back
the gold to your hair
if god would but
grant me the power
just to turn back
the pages of time
i would give all
i own just to put a tone
to that silver
haired daddy of mine"
"wish i had a known ya
when you were a little younger
around me you might have learned
a thing or two
if i had known you longer
you might be a little stronger
and maybe you'd shoot straighter
then you doooo
maybe you'd shoot straighter
then you do
as he walked into the poolroom
you could tell he didn't fit
in his handmade boots, custom suits
and pearl handled shooting stick
tonight there'd be a showdown
then everyone would know
who shoots the meanest game around
the baron or billy joe
billy joe looked edgy
about to lose his cool
but the baron's hands were steady
as the two began to duel
yeah he was like a general
on a battlefield of slate
and he'd say to billy joe
each time he sunk the eight
he'd say
wish i had a known ya
when you were a little younger
around me you might have learned
a thing or two
if i had known you longer
you might be a little stronger
and maybe you'd shoot straighter
then you doooo
maybe you'd shoot straighter
then you do
now billy joe was busted
but he hadn't felt the sting
and from the far end of the table
he threw his mother's wedding ring
and he said you won my money
but it ain't gonna do the trick
i'll bet this ring on one more game
against your fancy stick
the baron's eyes got foggy
as the ring rolled on the felt
and he almost doubled over
like he had been hit below the belt
twenty years ago
it was the ring his wife had worn
and he didn't know before he left
that a son would soon be born
it sounded just like thunder
when the baron shot the break
but it grew thickly quiet
as he lined up the eight
then a warm hand touched his shoulder
and it chilled him to the bone
when he turned and saw the woman
who had loved him for so long
the game was never finished
the eight ball never fell
the baron calmly picked it up
and put it on the shelf
then he placed the ring
in the hands that held him long ago
and he tossed that fancy shooting stick
to his son billy joe
and he said
wish i had a known ya
when you were a little younger
around me you might have learned
a thing or two
if i had known you longer
you might be a little stronger
and maybe you'd shoot straighter
then you doooo
maybe you'd shoot straighter
then you do

"in eighteen fourteen we took a little trip
along with colonel jackson down the mighty mississipp'

stepped so high and they began to sing
we stood beside the cotton bails and didn't say a thing
we fired our guns...
yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
and they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
they ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico
well we fired our cannon till the barrel melted down
then we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
we filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind
and when we took the powder off the 'gator lost his mind
we fired our guns...

"well i had a little feeling to have a big night
and woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right
i had to face the who am i and where is she and what did i do
but worst of all i had to face the big light
the big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
and it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that i did
i can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
and i'm thankful that i didn't open another bottle of inspiration
when the hangover this morning had a personality
and i cast my shattered mind over selected memories
i didn't even touch the light switch so i knew i'd never see
the haggard face that would be staring back at me
the big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
and it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that i did
i can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
and i'm thankful that i didn't open another bottle of inspiration
well i had a little feeling to have a big time
and i woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime
i had to face the who am i and who is she and what did i do
but worst of all i had to face the big light
the big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
and it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that i did
i can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
and i'm thankful that i didn't open another bottle of inspiration
well, it's fine to go out and have a big night
but sooner or later you're gonna face the big light"
"now you've heard of folks with a lot of ambition
but i believe just about the biggest case of ambition i ever saw
was in a bug that i saw crawlin' along the beach one day
he was a mighty ambitious bug
on the beach one early mornin' as a day was newly dawnin'
and the sun again was warmin' all the chill thru'out the land
i saw me a bug a walkin' and at first i thought he was quakin'
then i found out he was talkin' while he crawled across the sand
he was crawlin' mighty straight at a slow but a steady gait
and when i asked him to wait he said oh come on crawl with me
but i said where you goin' and he said you'll be knowin'
for i'm gonna make a showin' and you'll someday see
well i stood there by the ocean i suddenly had the notion
that i start this big promotion so this challenge i enfirled said the bug
so i gave my wife a hug and i left my confy rug
so i could be the only bug that ever crawled around the world
well he seemed mighty small and it was a long way to crawl
and i'm sure he couldn't swim at all so i try to discourage my friend
i said you know the world is round and there's mighty lotta ground
and there some water to be found before you reach your journey's end
and he said now don't you fret there's problems to be met
but i'll make it you can bet and this deed will bring glory to my name
you know they said man would never fly now he's soarin' in the sky
cause he had the will to try so let me win my fame
so he crawled on out of sight as he sought that splendoured height
neither lookin' left nor right but slowly marchin' toward his goal
and my knowin' he had started on his journey as we parted
kept me from feelin' too down hearted for he was a mighty ambitious soul
well i've looked everywhere i've been and seen a lotta bugs since then
but not one quite like my little friend when i think of him i'm filled with pride
did he make it i don't know he was crawlin' mighty slow and he had a long way to go
and all i can tell you folks is that he tried he sure was an ambitious bug"
"it happened one day near december's end
two neighbors called on an old friend
and they found his shop so meager and lame
made g** with a thousand bows of green
and conrad was sittin' with face ashined
when he suddenly stopped as he stiched a twine
and he said ""oh friends at dawn today
when the cock was crowin' the night away
the lord appeared in a dream to me
and said 'i'm comin' your guest to be.'
so i've been busy with feet astir
and strewin' my shop with branches of fir
the table is spread and the kettle is shined
and over the rafters the holly is twined
now i'll wait for my lord to appear
and listen closely so i will hear his step
as he nears my humble place
and i'll open the door and look on his face""
so his friends went home and left conrad alone
for this was the happiest day he'd known
for long since his family had passed away
and conrad had spent many a sad christmas day
but he knew with the lord as his christmas guest
this christmas would be the dearest and best
so he listened with only joy in his heart
and with every sound he would rise with a start
and look for the lord to be at his door
like the vision he'd had a few hours before
so he ran to the window after hearin' a sound
but all he could see on the snow covered ground
was a shabby begger who's shoes were torn
and all of his clothes were ragged and worn
but conrad was touched and he went to the door
and he said
""you know, your feet must be frozen and sore
i have some shoes in my shop for you
and a coat that'll keep you warmer too""
so with grateful heart, the man went away
but conrad noticed the time of day
and wondered what made the lord so late
and how much longer he'd have to wait
when he heard a knock he ran to the door
but it was only a stranger once more
a bent ol' lady with a shawl of black
with a bundle of kindlin' piled on her back
she asked for only a place to rest
but that was reserved for conrad's great guest
but her voice seemed to plead ""don't send me away
let me rest for awhile on christmas day""
so conrad brewed her a steamin' cup
and told her to sit at the table and sup
but after she left he was filled with dismay
for he saw that the hours were slippin' away
and the lord hadn't come as he said he would
and conrad felt sure he'd misunderstood
when out of the stillness he heard a cry
""please help me, and tell me where am i!""
so again he opened his friendly door
and stood disappointed as twice before
it was only a child who'd wandered away
and was lost from her family on christmas day
again, conrad's heart was heavy and sad
but he knew he should make the little girl glad
so he called her in and he wiped her tears
and quieted all her childish fears
then he led her back to her home once more
but as he entered his own darkened door
he knew the lord was not comin' today
for the hours of christmas had passed away
so he went to his room and he knelt down to pray
and he said ""dear lord, why did you delay?
what kept you from comin' to call on me?
for i wanted so much your face to see""
when soft in the silence, a voice he heard
""lift up your head, for i kept my word
three times my shadow crossed your floor
and three times i came to your lonely door
i was the begger with bruised, cold feet
and i was the woman you gave somethin' to eat
i was the child on the homeless street.
three times i knocked and three times i came in
and each time i found the warmth of a friend
of all the gifts love is the best
and i was honored to be your christmas guest"
"on christmas eve i dreamed i traveled all around the earth
and in my dream i saw and heard the ways the different people hail the king
whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was
in london town i walked around piccadilly circus
a mass of people movin' here and there i wandered where
on every face at every place was hurry up i'm late
but a kind old man at a chestnut stand said merry christmas mate
and i felt the christmas spirit
in a little town nestled down in bavaria germany
i walked along to see what the feeling there would be
and here again was the busy din the rushin' the yellin'
but some kind boy said frohliche weihnachten
not undesratnding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin'
i felt the christmas spirit
in bethlehem i heard a hymn some distant choir sang
and with other tourists i walked along to a church as its bells rang
then i heard someone tell someone there's where christ was born
i wonder if he looked like our baby looked on that first morn
and then i really felt the christmas spirit
from a businessman in the holy land as a sidewalk souvenirshop
i bought a little bible since i'd hardly stopped
and it was in paris france somehow by chance that i took the bible out
and as i flipped the pages i saw these words and i knew what it was all about
for i read fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy
which shall be to all people
for unto you he was born this day in the city of david a saviour
which is christ the lord
then i took the little holy book held it close and tight
i closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night
so suddenly it came to me for when i awoke on christmas day
i felt the christmas spirit down deep inside to stay
(o little town of bethlehem how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight)"
"the legs on the lady a walkin'
was tanned to a dark berry brown
her body was made like a song to be played
to the tune of a million a pound
so was a wonder of a woman i reckon
and she sure screwed her head on right
the toast of the world was the long legged girl
and the cowboy who started the fight
he'd just pulled into town in an old green 1953 chevrolet pickup truck
with whiskey bumps all over it and the right front fender falling off
he coasted on into a no parking zone
got out and took the keys and chunked 'em down a gutter
turned around and just walked off
he allowed how his time had been wasted
on drinking and running around
he spent half his life searchin' barrooms at night
for the sweetheart that he never found
it was plain from the moment their eyes met
they'd wind up in each others arms
the lady's young life was laid open that night
and the cowboy drank deep of her charms
singing hey hi de he from the depths of the sea
to the mountains so hollering high
i've found the best one under god's given sun
yeah the cowboy got lucky tonight
while the angel beside him lay sleeping
he silently thanked god above
for being a kind hearted father
and blessing his love with her love
for one night of love with that woman
was more than he knew he deserved
so he found all he had left worth givin'
and he gave all he had left to her
he slid back inside his ole levi's
and he filled up his boots with his feet
while the subways beneath new york city
screamed through the veins of the street
for the lady gave up without question
the trophy she saved all her life
then she curled up beside his old weather worn hide
and the cowboy just laid down and died
hey hi de hi with a whoop through the street
as his soul slowly winged out of sight
the lady was torn from the child bein' born
and the cowboy found heaven that night
the lady was torn from the child bein' born
and the cowboy found heaven that night"
"i was laughing at all these people, who
jump through hoops and loop
in the name of love
i told all my friends this could never
happen to me
'cause bein' free was all this boy was
thinkn' of
then one night i met this woman
who set my soul on fire
now i'm a liar
well i can't control these crazy feelin's
i found my heart is not my own
i'm in the danger zone
i'm in the danger zone
i'm in the danger zone
you got me in the danger zone
now bells are ringin'
and lights are flashin'
danger   look out boy
'cause love is everywhere
now all of my friends   now they're all
laughin'
i jump through hoops and loop de loop
but i don't care
'cause one night i met this woman
who set my soul on fire
now i'm a liar
well i can't control these crazy feelin's
i found my heart is not my own
i'm in the danger zone
i'm in the danger zone
you got me in the danger zone
i'm in the danger zone"
"go on girl take your chances
see how long you can go on from man to man
i can read the lines between your stolen glances
and i know it's time to fold this loosing hand
cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame
of the cheatin' game they taught you how to play
you've got nothing to lose but your soul girl
and you've only the devil to pay
you've been flying so high you don't know
that you're blind to the writin' on the wall
but some day you'll look down
and you'll find you've got no place to fall
when the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
forsaken in the naked light of day
then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
and you've still got the devil to pay
join your friends while you got 'em
cause you know they're gettin' fewer every day
you can't wait to let them take you to the bottom
and i'm gettin' tired of standin' in your way
but when you hit the ground don't come looking around
for the pieces of the love you threw away
that's the price of the high life you're livin'
and you still got the devil to pay
you've been flying so high you don't know
that you're blind to the writin' on the wall
but some day you'll look down
and you'll find you've got no place to fall
when the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
forsaken in the naked light of day
then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
and you've still got the devil to pay"
"he slowly raised the trembling hand
gently brushed the silver strand of hair from his wrinkled brow
lips that used to talk so free the eyes that used to beckon me were silent now
he listens to a passin' train gives into an old familiar pain familiar pain
they retired him twenty years ago gave him a watch made of gold and took his train
his woman's name was margaret
he loved her but she went away and left his heart undone
he called this train the diplomat she's the only other lady that he ever loved
some forty years he made the steam
from memphis down to new orleans but now he's off the line
and the closest that he ever gets margaret or the diplomat is in his mind
he siad take me to the station the diplomat is bringing margaret home
can't you hear that whistle blowing they both know i've been alone for much too long
let's not keep 'em waitin' we'll talk about the good times later on
right now take me to the station the diplomat is bringing margaret home
they say he talks crazy when
he sees the passin' train or when he hears margaret's name
but the only things he ever loved he lost before he loved enough he's not to blame
so who's to say he's right or wrong
reachin' out and hangin' on to dreams he can't let go
he threw the watch of gold away but keeps tracks of memories where he belongs
he siad take me to the station...
they retired him twenty years ago gave him a watch made of gold
and took daddy's train"
"a little child on a sickbed lay,
and death was very near.
he was
the pride and the only child of a railroad engineer.
his duty had
called him from those he loved,
and seeing that hope was dim.
while
a tear he shed to his wife he said,
""just have two lanterns trimmed.""
just hang a light when i pass tonight.
hang it where it
can be seen.
if the baby's dead then show the red.
if he's better
then show the green.
in a little shack,
by the railroad
track,
a mother with watchful eyes.
saw a gleam of hope in a tender
smile,
as the train went rushing by,
just one short look,
was
his only chance?
to see the light a gleam.
in the midnight air their
rose a prayer.
thank god the light was green.
just hang a light when i pass tonight.
hang it where it can be
seen.
if the baby's dead then show the red.
if he's better then
show the green."
"i heard the laughter at the depot
but my tears fell like the rain
when i saw them place that long white casket
in the baggage coach of the evening train
the baby's eyes are red from weeping
its little heart is filled with pain
oh daddy cried they're taking mama
away from us on the evening train
as i turned to walk away from the depot
it seemed i heard her call my name
take care of my baby and tell him darling
that i'm going home on the evening train
i pray that god will give me courage
to carry on 'til we meet again
it's hard to know she's gone forever
they're carrying her home on the evening train"
"while traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea
there have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place
and quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest
or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creekbed
hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe
or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished indians
there's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead
over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my god i walked alone
in a furrow bed i found an arrowhead chiseled from stone
i don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight
or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night
i do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill
and proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill
that i inherited this ground is denied by this stone i've found but when and by who
come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through
in love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too
but quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust
i'm proud that their craftsmen's skill survives the ages still left in my trust"
"as i walk these narrow streets
where a million passing feet have tried before me
with my guitar in my hand suddenly
i realize nobody knows me
where yesterday the multitude screamed
and cried my name out for a song
the day the streets are empty
and the crowds have all gone home
i pass a million houses but there is no place where i belong
all i knew to give it was song after song after song
all the truth i try to tell you were as distant to you as the moon
born 200 years too late and 200 years too soon
i'm a child of this age locked inside the pages of your book
and when i am but dust and clay and other children stop take look
well they marble at the miracles i did before them
and to the heights i did inspired
or will they tear out the pages of the book to light a fire
with the rain on my face there is no place where i belong
did you forget the folk singer so soon?
and did you forget my song?"
"as i sat down one evening within a small cafe,
a forty year old waitress to me these words did say
""i see that you are a logger, and not just a common bum,
'cause nobody but a logger stirs his coffee with is thumb
my lover was a logger, there's none like him today
if you'd pour whiskey on it he could eat a bale of hay
he never shaved his whiskers from off of his horny hide
he'd just drive them in with a hammer and bite them off inside
my lover came to see me upon one freezing day
he held me in his fond embrace which broke three vertebrae
he kissed me when we parted, so hard that he broke my jaw;
i could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw
i saw my lover leaving, sauntering through the snow,
going gaily homeward at forty eight below
the weather it tried to freeze him, it tried its level best
at a hundred degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest
it froze clean through to china, it froze to the stars above
at a thousand degrees below zero, it froze my logger love
they tried in vain to thaw him, and would you believe me, sir
they made him into axeblades, to chop the douglas fir
and so i lost my lover, and to this cafe i come,
and here i wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb"
"about 20 years ago, on a train bound for nowhere,
i met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
so we took turns a starin' through the window at the darkness.
til' boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak.
he said: ""son, i've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
""and knowin' what their cards were, by the way they held their eyes.
""and if you don't mind my sayin', i would say you're out of aces;
""and for one taste of your whiskey, i will give you some advice.""
so i handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow.
then he bummed a cigarette; then he bummed a light.
the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression.
he said: ""if you're gonna play the game, boy, you better learn to play it right.""
""'cos ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survival,
""is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep.
""and ev'ry hand's a winner, just like ev'ry hand's a loser.
""and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.
""you got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""know when to walk away; know when to run.

and when he finished speakin', he turned back t'ward the window.
put out his cigarette; faded off to sleep.
and somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even.
but in his final words i found an ace that i could keep.

i'm a charger that charges through the night
like an orange bolt of lightning passing everything in sight
i'm the best pal the duke boys ever had
i'm thunder on the highway lookin' bad, bad, bad
i'm a knight, like the kind in shining armor
with my polished body gleaming
i'm a fighter and a charmer
if trouble comes your way just ask for me
my friends all know me as the general lee
i'm the gerneral lee
a piston pumpin', steel belted cavalry
i'll never let you down when you're ridin' with me
buckle up and i'll show you what i mean
take a look back there
sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere
we'll cross the fields and we'll be runnin' free
they'll eat dust compliments of me
the general lee
i'm a hero, and that's how i'll make you feel
when you're ridin' shotgun with me
and the law is at your heels
i'm glory bound, but when the chase is done
i'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun
i've got style, tearin through the curves
let my flag wave proudly to the people that i serve
i'm number one, and i will always be
the pride of the south they call the general lee
i'm the gerneral lee
a piston pumpin', steel belted cavalry
i'll never let you down when you're ridin' with me
buckle up and i'll show you what i mean
take a look back there
sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere
i'll jump that pond and we'll be runnin' free
and they'll go swimmin', compliments of me
the general lee, the general lee

"four score and seven years ago so began the message
of a war weary president abraham lincoln
a message written on the back of an envelope on a train
on the way to dedicate a battlefield
where men from the north and south
had died at gettysburg pennsylvania
four score and seven years ago our forefathers
brought forth on this continent
a new nation conceived in liberty
and dedicated in the proposition that all men are created equal
now we're engaged in a great civil war
testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated can long endure
we are met on a great battlefield of that war
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field
as the final resting place for those who here gave their lives
that that nation might live
it is altogether fitting and proper thast we should do this
but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate
we cannot hallow this ground
for the brave men living and dead who struggled here
have consecreated it far above our poor power to add or detract
the world will little notice or long remember what we say here
but it can never forget what they did here
it is for us the living rather to be dedicasted here
to the unfinished work
which they who fought here have thus so nobly advanced
it is rather for us to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion
to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died
in vain and that this nation under god
shall have a new birth of freedom
and the government of the peopole by the people and for the people
shall not perish from the earth"

"the good earth swallows up the seed and swallows life as well
from long before the day you're born till heaven comes or hell
it binds your hands with chains of clay that are so hard to break
but when i left good earth behind i made a big mistake
i've traveled far and traveled wide
i've seen a lot of things
but looking back on all the years
i don't know what they mean
like steel i'm probably stronger
from going through the fire
i kept on climbin' lower
diggin' deeper to get higher
i turned around one evening when the sun was going down
i heard the bible told a preacher who just pulled into town
at last i'm back on good earth where i should have always been
lord forgive me if i ever try to leave good earth again
well the good earth was my mama and my daddy too
now i'm working my hands in soil tryin' to pay my due
and when i'll breathe my last breath which may not be too long
just shovel a little good earth over my head
till everybody open up the hymn book and sing a happy song
shall we gather at the river in the sweet by and by
just as i am jesus loves me one of these days i'll fly
i'm standing on the promises lord build the place for me
in the good earth over jordan by the sea of galilee mhm"
"have always had my heroes i've loved a lot of legends
many men in my mind are ridin' tall
but my cowboy hero hats off to the man who rode a donkey
he's the greatest cowboy of them all
he loves all his little doggies he speaks to them kind and gently
and he'll lift up any maverick that falls
he sees every stray that scatters like it's the only one that matters
he's the greatest cowboy of them all
once he rode into the sunset but some returning sunrise
he'll call up all the riders in the sky
i gotta get my roll together gettin' ready for that sunrise
that winds up where old cowboys never die
the trail he rides is narrow but it's straighter than an arrow
and he rides point for all the great and small
he will take us through the wire onto that plain that's higher
he's the greatest cowboy of them all
once he rode into the sunset...
he's the greatest cowboy of them all"
"oh, the hells i
put myself through
the fights i
didn't need to fight
this thick head of mine
ya couldn't get through
had to do it wrong
just to get it right
just to get it right
i learned the hard way
the hard way taught me well
the hard way
sure put me  through some hell
the hard way
taught me how to tell
the right way from the wrong
and on which side i belong
deep are the memories
as a young boy
of the lessons
that i learned
my mama warnin' me
that fire is no toy
ya play with fire boy
and you get burned
oh i got burned
what others learned in sunday school
i learned by gettin' black n' blue"
"when i was a curly headed baby
my daddy sat me down upon his knee he said
""boy, you go to school and learn your letters
don't you be a dirty miner like me""
i was born and raised in the mouth of the hazard
hollow coal cars rambled past my door now
they're standin' in a rusty row all empty
and the l & n don't stop here anymore
i used to think my daddy was a black man
with script enough to buy the company store
now he goes downtown with empty pockets
and his face is white as a february snow
i was born and raised in the mouth of the
hazard hollow coal cars rambled past my door
now they're standin' in a rusty row all empty
and the l & n don't stop here anymore
last night i dreamed i went down
to the coal yard to draw my pay like
i always did before but them ol' kudzu vines
were comin' through the window and the leaves
and grass were growin' through the floor
i was born and raised in the mouth
of the hazard hollow coal cars rambled
past my door now they're standin' in a rusty row
all empty and the l & n don't stop here anymore"

this the last cowboy song:
the end of a hundred year waltz.
the voices sound sad as they're singin' along.
another piece of america's lost.
he rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets,
on weekends sellin' tobacco and beer.
and his dreams of tomorrow, surrounded by fences,
but he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here.
he blazed the trail with lewis and clark,
and eyeball to eyeball, old wyatt backed down.
he stood shoulder to shoulder with travis in texas.
and rode with the 7th when custer went down.
this the last cowboy song:
the end of a hundred year waltz.
the voices sound sad as they're singin' along.
another piece of america's lost.
remmington showed us how he looked on canvas,
and louis lamour has told us his tale.
me and johnny and waylon and kris sing about him,
and wish to god we could have ridden his trail.
the old chisolm trail is covered in concrete now,
they truck it to market in fifty foot rigs.
they roll by his markings and don't even notice,
like living and dying was all he ever did.
this the last cowboy song:
the end of a hundred year waltz.
the voices sound sad as they're singin' along.
another piece of america's lost.
this the last cowboy song:
the end of a hundred year waltz.
the voices sound sad as they're singin' along.
another piece of america's lost."
"i was standing by my window yesterday morning
without a thought of worry or regret
when i saw the postman coming down the pathway
he was bringin' me a letter edged in black
well, he rang the bell and he whistled while he waited
and then he said ""good morning to you jack""
but he never knew the sorrow that he brought me
when he handed me that letter edged in black
with trembling hand i took the letter from him
i broke the seal and this is what it said:
""come home, my boy, your dear old father want you
come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead""
""the last words that your mother's ever uttered
was, 'tell my boy i want him to come back'
my eyes are doomed my poor old heart is breaking
and i'm writing you this letter edged in black""
i belt my reading sorrow and in silence
the sunshine of my life, it all has fled
since the postman brought that letter yesterday morning
saying: ""come home, my boy, your poor mother's dead""
""thosing andry words i wish i'd never spoken
you know i never mean them don't you jack
may the angels bear me witness i am asking
your forgiveness in this letter edged in black"""
"ten years ago, on a cold dark night
someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
there were few at the scene, but they all agreed
that the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me
she walks these hills in a long black veil
she visits my grave when the night winds wail
nobody knows, nobody sees
nobody knows but me
the judge said son, what is your alibi
if you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
i spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
for i'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
she stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
but late at night, when the north wind blows
in a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones
she walks these hills in a long black veil
she visits my grave when the night winds wail
nobody knows, nobody sees
nobody knows but me
oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
she stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
but late at night, when the north wind blows
in a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones
she walks these hills in a long black veil
she visits my grave when the night winds wail
nobody knows, nobody sees
nobody knows but me"
"lost my job, i lost my money
i turn my back and lost my honey
lord i guess i'm just the losing kind
lost my license 'cause i drove too fast
got in a game and i lost my cash
lord i guess i'm just the losing kind
some day the cops are gonna come around
and turn me over to the lost and found
i was sitting on the porch the other day
and watched the finance man drive my car away
i'm too proud to crawl too weak to run
i'd shoot myself but i lost my gun
lord i guess i'm just the losing kind
well if it was a raining dollar bills
and i was up on the highest hill
clouds would break out and the sun would shine
the only way that i can win
is pick a fight and bet on him
lord i guess i'm just the losing kind
some day the cops are gonna come around
and turn me over to the lost and found
i just got a letter from a baby of mine
she's in las vegas and she likes it fine
i'm too proud to crawl and i'm too weak to run
i'd shoot myself but i lost my gun
lord i guess i'm just the losing kind
i bet on the horses to recoup my losses
and lost the tickets on the winning horses
lord i guess i'm just the losing kind"
"you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
you gave me a song i learned to sing
you showed me some beauty
through the windows of your soul
and you showed me a world i've never seen
each giving to the other love an' givin' it away
we spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
'cause you gave me the courage
to live with yesterday
and you gave me tomorrow
you brought me a candle to light my way to bed
you erased those shadows i'd been seeing
you brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
you taught me a gentle way of dreaming
and even if you leave me
i'll be richer when you go
i'm richer with the lovin' gift you gave me
'cause you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
and you gave me a baby"
"and i heard, as it were, the noise of thunder:
one of the four beasts saying: ""come and see.""
and i saw.
and behold, a white horse.
there's a man going around taking names
and he decides who to free and who to blame
everybody won't be treated all the same
there'll be a golden ladder reaching down
when the man comes around
the hairs on your arm will stand up
at the terror in each sip and in each sup
will you partake of that last offered cup?
or disappear into the potter's ground
when the man comes around
hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singing
multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
voices calling, voices crying
some are born and some are dying
it's alpha and omega's kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
till armageddon no shalam, no shalom
then the father hen will call his chickens home
the wise man will bow down before the thrown
and at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
when the man comes around
whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
listen to the words long written down
when the man comes around
hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singing
multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
voices calling and voices crying
some are born and some are dying
it's alpha and omega's kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
in measured hundred weight and penny pound
when the man comes around.
and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts,
and i looked and behold: a pale horse.
and his name, that sat on him, was death.
and hell followed with him."
"there once was a man who just couldn't cry
he hadn't cried for years and for years
napalmed babies and the movie love story
for instance could not produce tears
as a child he had cried as all children will
then at some point his tear ducts ran dry
he grew to be a man, the feces hit the fan
things got bad, but he couldn't cry
his dog was run over, his wife up and left him
and after that he got sacked from his job
lost his arm in the war, was laughed at by a whore
ah, but sill not a sniffle or sob
his novel was refused, his movie was panned
and his big broadway show was a flop
he got sent off to jail; you guessed it, no bail
oh, but still not a dribble or drop
in jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
and made to make license plates
water and bread was all he was fed
but not once did a tear stain his face
doctors were called in, scientists, too
theologians were last and practically least
they all agreed sure enough; this was sure no cream puff
but in fact an insensitive beast
he was removed from jail and placed in a place
for the insensitive and the insane
he played lots of chess and made lots of friends
and he wept every time it would rain
once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
and he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried
on the forty first day, he passed away
he just dehydrated and died
well, he went up to heaven, located his dog
not only that, but he rejoined his arm
down below, all the critics, they loot it all back
cancer robbed the whore of her charm
his ex wife died of stretch marks, his ex employer went broke
the theologians were finally found out
right down to the ground, that old jail house burned down
the earth suffered perpetual drought"
"it began when they come took me from my home
and put me on death row,
a crime for which i am totally innocent, you know.
i began to warm and chill
to objects and their fields,
a ragged cup, a twisted mop
the face of jesus in my soup
those sinister dinner deals
the meal trolley's wicked wheels
a hooked bone rising from my food
all things either good or ungood.
and the mercy seat is waiting
and i think my head is burning
and in a way i'm yearning
to be done with all this weighing of the truth.
an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth
and anyway i told the truth
and i'm not afraid to die.
i hear stories from the chamber
christ was born into a manger
and like some ragged stranger
he died upon the cross
might i say, it seems so fitting in its way
he was a carpenter by trade
or at least that's what i'm told
my kill hand's
tatooed e.v.i.l. across it's brother's fist
that filthy five! they did nothing to challenge or resist.
in heaven his throne is made of gold
the ark of his testament is stowed
a throne from which i'm told
all history does unfold.
it's made of wood and wire
and my body is on fire
and god is never far away.
into the mercy seat i climb
my head is shaved, my head is wired
and like a moth that tries
to enter the bright eye
i go shuffling out of life
just to hide in death awhile
and anyway i never lied.
and the mercy seat is waiting
and i think my head is burning
and in a way i'm yearning
to be done with all this weighing of the truth.
an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth
and anyway i told the truth
and i'm not afraid to die.
and the mercy seat is burning
and i think my head is glowing
and in a way i'm hoping
to be done with all this twisting of the truth.
an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth
and anyway there was no proof
and i'm not afraid to die.
and the mercy seat is glowing
and i think my head is smoking
and in a way i'm hoping
to be done with all these looks of disbelief.
a life for a life
and a truth for a truth
and i've got nothing left to lose
and i'm not afraid to die.
and the mercy seat is smoking
and i think my head is melting
and in a way that's helping
to be done with all this twisting of the truth
an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth
and anyway i told the truth
but i'm afraid i told a lie."
"harry truman was our president
a coke an burger cost you thirty cents
i was still in love with mavis brown
on the night hank williams came to town.
""i love lucy"" debuted on tv
that was one big event we didn't see
'cause no one stayed at home for miles around
it was the night hank williams came to town.
mama ironed my shirt and daddy let me take the truck
i drove on out to grapevine and picked old mavis up
we hit that county line for one quick round
on the night hank williams came to town.
a thousand people sweltered in the gym
then i heard someone whisper; ""hey, that's him""
that's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
it was the night hank williams came to town.
on and on he sang into the night
'jambalaya', 'cheatin' heart', 'i saw the light'
how'd they get miss audrey in that gown
on the night hank williams came to town.
mavis had her picture made with hank outside his car
she said; ""he sure is humble for a grand ole opry star.""
mavis said: ""why don't we hang around
it ain't often that hank williams comes to town.""
while hank signed his autograph on beaulah rice's fan
mavis got acquainted with the driftin' cowboys band
the effect on all our lives was quite proound
on the night hank williams came to town.
radio announcer's voice in the background:
remember, friends and neighbors, hank williams and all the drifting
cowboys will be at the high school gym in person for one show only
this saturday night. the big 2 hour show starts at 7:30   tickets are
just a dollar fifty each; you get your money's worth the first 15 minutes
and the rest is free. that's saturday night   advance tickets are on sale

"virgil caine is the name, and i served on the danville train,
til stonemans cavalry came and tore up the tracks again.
in the winter of 65, we were hungry, just barely alive.
by may the tenth, richmond had fell, its a time i remember, oh so well,
the night they drove old dixie down, and the bells were ringing,
the night they drove old dixie down, and the people were singin. they went
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
back with my wife in tennessee, when one day she called to me,
virgil, quick, come see, there goes robert e. lee!
now i dont mind choppin wood, and i dont care if the moneys no good.
ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest,
but they should never have taken the very best. like my father before me, i will work the land,
like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand.
he was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a yankee laid him in his grave,
i swear by the mud below my feet,
you cant raise a caine back up when hes in defeat."
"there once was a musical troupe
a pickin' singin' folk group
they sang the mountain ballads
and the folk songs of our land
they were long on musical ability
folks thought they would go far
but political incompatibility led to their downfall
well, the one on the right was on the left
and the one in the middle was on the right
and the one on the left was in the middle
and the guy in the rear was a methodist
this musical aggregation toured the entire nation
singing the traditional ballads
and the folk songs of our land
they performed with great virtuosity
and soon they were the rage
but political animosity prevailed upon the stage
well, the one on the right was on the left
and the one in the middle was on the right
and the one on the left was in the middle
and the guy in the rear burned his driver's license
well the curtain had ascended
a hush fell on the crowd
as thousands there were gathered to hear the folk songs of our land
but they took their politics seriously
and that night at the concert hall
as the audience watched deliriously
they had a free for all
well, the one on the right was on the bottom
and the one in the middle was on the top
and the one on the left got a broken arm
and the guy in the rear, said, ""oh dear""
now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land
just work on harmony and diction
play your banjo well
and if you have political convictions keep them to yourself
now, the one on the left works in a bank
and the one in the middle drives a truck
the one on the right's an all night deejay
and the guy in the rear got drafted"
"so blue lonesome too but still true
rosie haunts me makes me think of you
you're the one rose that's left in my heart, dear i love you, adore you, i do
each night in dreamland we wander along
telling love stories anew
when from a blue sky a black cloud came rolling
breaking my heart in two
oh we ought not to part
i have said from the start
you're the one rose that's left in my heart
oh we ought not to part
i have said from the start
you're the one rose that's left in my heart"
"i lean my back against you thinkin' you were an oak
i knew the wind could bend you but i can't believe you broke
now the wind could never break me only your false love
honey i've been true i swear by god above
i thought you were a willow but you never wept for me
you went roamin' in the wildwood like a ship that roams the see
the willow tree is fickle and it weeps in the morning dew
my love is a pine tree cause that's the only tree that's true
if i was mistaken then take my eyes away
you made a bed in the wildwood and that's where i saw you lay
honey your eyes deceived you it's true i touched the ground
but i never slept there i never let my long hair down mhm
love is like a thorn bush touch it and you will find
you'll prick your fingers and leave the sweetest flower behind
love oh love oh what you done to me
you set me a driftin' like a ship upon the sea
yes a ship there is i see you and you belong to me
my love is the ocean and deeper love cannot be
yeah well i guess i was mistaken and woman i want you back
you never have left my heart now honey baby that's a fact
come to me pine tree and we will never part
we'll put our roots down in each other's heart
come to me pine tree and we will never part
we'll put our roots down in each other's heart"
"well with everybody tryin' to tell us what to do
you wonder how are you to know whose word is true
but the preacher just keep on a bringing us
the very same word
and from st. paul to billy graham the same is heard
and the preacher said of truth, ""jesus said. ""
""and jesus said, 'i'm the way, the truth, and the life. '""
well we can see that the world is full of greed
there's so much hate yet there is so much need
what should we do when no one seems to care?
what can we do when there is no love there?
and then the preacher said of love, ""jesus said, ""
""jesus said, 'love thy neighbor as thyself. '""
well please tell us the road we oughta go
in such confusion how are we to know?
and if there is a heaven show us to its gates
oh you'd better tell us preacher before it's too late
and then the preacher said of heaven, ""jesus said""
""jesus said, 'seek ye first the kingdom of god
and his righteousness
and all these things shall be added unto you'""
well please tell us how we can find a way
to climb every mountain that we face every day
and in time of trouble what to depend upon
to be the truth and help us carry on
and the preacher said of trouble, ""jesus said""
""jesus said, 'let not your heart be troubled
if you believe in god believe also in me
in my father's house are many mansions
if it were not so i would have told you
i go to prepare a place for you
and if i prepare a place for you i will come again
and receive you unto myself
that where i am there you may be also'"""

and gamble with death
the rebel, johnny yuma"
"writer billy edd wheeler, jed peters
 he rode easy in the saddle. he was tall and lean, and at first you'd a thought nothing but a streak of mean could make a man look so down right strong, but one look in his eyes and you knowed you was wrong. he was a mountain of a man, and i want you to know. he could preach hot hell or freezin' snow. he carried a bible in a canvas sack and folks just called him the reverend mr. black. he was poor as a beggar, but he rode like a king. sometimes in the evening, i'd hear him sing:
chorus:
i gotta walk that lonesome valley. i got to walk it by myself. oh nobody else can walk it for me. i got to walk it by myself.
you got to walk that lonesome valley. you got to walk it by yourself. oh nobody else can walk it for you. you got to walk it by yourself.
if ever i could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back, i gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray. yeah, he kicked open the meeting house door and he cussed everybody up and down the floor! then, when things got quiet in the place, he walked up and cusses in the preacher's face! he hit that reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinkin' it took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack, but that's what he did, the reverend mr. black. he stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again, and then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said:
it's been many years since we had to part and i guess i learned his ways by heart. i can still hear his sermon's ring, down in the valley where he used to sing. i followed him, yes, sir, and i don't regret it and i hope i will always be a credit to his memory 'cause i want you to understand. the reverend mr. black was my old man!"
"yes they always whisper to me of the days of long ago
when the settlers and the miner fought the crafty navajo
how the cattle roamed the valley happy people worked the land
now everything is covered by the shifting whispering sands
and the burrows broke their halters
when they thought he'd gone to stay
how they found that ancient miner lying dead upon the sands
and for months they could but wonder
did he die by human hands
so they dug his grave and laid him on his back
and crossed his hands
and his secret still is covered by the shifting whispering sands
this is what they always whisper to me out
on the quiet desert air
of the people and the cattle and that miner lying there
so if you want to learn the secret wander through this quiet land
and i'm sure you'll hear the story of the shifting whispering sands"
"i stood in there in the shadows
as they went strolling by
now she ain't my girl no longer
there's no reason i should cry
but i knew there went my future
and i couldn't stop the tears
and the sound of laughter
ringing in my ears
i spent every dime i had on her
and when it was gone
she said hun, it's sure been fun
but its time you moved along
so i stood there in the shadows
and i had my .44
i could hear her mocking laughter
but she won't laugh anymore
now i'm down here in the gaolhouse
and i know what brought me here
it was the sound of laughter
ringing in my ears
well i guess i should have left this town
and her far behind
for the way that she made fun of me
keeps running through my mind
well the jury showed no mercy
and i never asked for none
cause i know i've got it coming
i'm not proud of what i've done
but down here in this darkness
more and more i seem to hear
the sound of laughter
ringing in my ears
i hear the sound of laughter
ringing in my ear"
"one morning at breakfast i said to my wife
we've been everywhere once and some places twice
as i had another helping of country ham
she said ""we haven't never been to vietnam
there's a bunch of our boys over there""
so we went
to the area saigon
well we got a big welcome when we drove in
through the gates of a placed named long ben
we checked in and everything got kinda quite
but a soldier boy said ""just wait till tonight
things get noisy things start happening
big bad firecrackers""
well that night we did about four shows for the boys
and they were living it up with a whole lot of noise
we did our last song for the night
then we crawled into bed for some peace and quite
but things weren't peaceful things weren't quite
things were scary
well for a few minutes june hadn't said a word
then i thought at first she hadn't heard
then a shell exploded not two miles away
she sat up in bed and i heard her say
""what was that"" i said ""that was a shell or a bomb""
she said ""i'm scared"" i said ""me too""
well all night long that noise kept on
and the sound would chill you right to the bone
the bullets and the bombs and the motor shells
shook our bed every time one fell and it never let up
it was gonna get worse before it got any better
well, when the sun came up the noise died down
we got a few minutes sleep and we were sleeping sound
then the soldier knocked on our door and said
""the last night we brought in seven dead and fourteen wounded!""
and we were come down to the base hospital
and see the boys yeah
so we went to the hospital war by day
and every night we were singing away
then the shells and the bombs till dawn again
and the helicopter brought in a wounded man
night after night day after day
coming and a going
so we sadly sang for them our last song
and reluctantly we said so long
we did our best to let them know that we cared
for every last one of them over there
whether we belonged over there or not
somebody over here loves them and needs them
well now that's about all there is to tell
about our little trip and the living hell
and if i ever go back over there anymore
i hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for
i hope this old war's over with and they're all back home
to stay in peace"
"there's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
but the strangest of em' all
was a friend of mine who spent his time
starin' at the wall...
starin' at the wall...
in his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
proving crime don't pay
was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
namin' her wedding day ,namin' her wedding day...
as he looked at the wall
so strong and tall
i heard him softly curse
nobody at all ever climbed that wall
but i'm gonna be the first...
i'm gonna be the first...
then the warden walked by and said son don't try
i'd hate to see you fall
cause there is no doubt they'll carry you out
if you ever touch that wall...
if you ever touch that wall...
well a years gone by since he made his try
but i can still recall
how hard he tried and the way he died
but he never made that wall...
he never made that wall...
well there's never been a man who shook this can
but i knew a man who tried
newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
but i know it was suicide...
i know it was suicide..."
"i went out walking through streets paved with gold
lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones
of a city without a soul
i went out walking under an atomic sky
where the ground won't turn and the rain it burns
like the tears when i said goodbye.
yeah, i went with nothing, nothing but the thought of you.
i went wandering.
i went drifting through the capitals of tin
where men can't walk or freely talk
and sons turn their fathers in.
i stopped outside a church house
where the citizens like to sit.
they say they want the kingdom
but they don't want god in it.
i went out riding down that old eight lane
i passed a thousand signs looking for my own name.
i went with nothing but the thought you'd be there too,
looking for you.
i went out there in search of experience
to taste and to touch and to feel as much
as a man can before he repents.
i went out searching, looking for one good man
a spirit who would not bend or break
who would sit at his father's right hand.
i went out walking with a bible and a gun
the word of god lay heavy on my heart
i was sure i was the one.
now jesus, don't you wait up, jesus i'll be home soon.
yeah, i went out for the papers, told her i'd be back by noon.
yeah, i left with nothing but the thought you'd be there too
looking for you.
yeah, i went with nothing, nothing but the thought of you.
i went wandering."
"i may say that i don't care hold up head up in the air
even tell my friends i'm glad that you don't call
but when the day is through my heartaches start anew
and that's when i miss you most of all
and my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you
my lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you
no matter how much i pretend i wish i had you back again
cause nothing else means half as much as you
my world just seemed to die the day you left my side
and i can't forget no matter what i do
and my arms keep reaching..."
"you're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie
well here i am and there you go, you're gone again
i know you're gonna be the way you've always been
breakin' hearts and tellin' lies is all you know
another guy gives you the eye and there you go
there you go, you're gone again
i should have known, i couldn't win
there you go, you're by his side
you're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie
because i love you so i take much more than i should take
i want you even though i know my heart is gonna break
you build me up and for a while i'm all a glow
then your fickle heart sees someone else and there you go
thre you go, you're gone again
i should have known, i couldn't win
there you go, you're by his side
you're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie"
"""so, you're going to leave the old home, jim
today you're going away
so, you're going among the city folks to dwell""
so spoke a kind old mother
to her boy one summer day
""if your mind's made up that way, i wish you well
the old home will be lonesome
we'll miss you when you go
the birds won't sing so sweet when you're not nigh
but if you get in trouble, jim
just write and let us know""
she spoke these words and then she said goodbye
if sickness overtakes you
or old companions shake you
as through this world you wander all alone
when friends you haven't any
in your pocket not a penny
there's a mother always awaiting you at home
ten years later to this village
came a stranger no one knew
his steps were halt and ragged clothes he wore
the little children laughed at him
as down the lane he trod
at last he stopped before a cottage door
he gently knocked, no sound he heard
he thought, ""can she be dead?""
but then he heard a voice well known to him
was his mother's voice, but her hair had silvered
by the touch of time
and she said, ""thank god, they've sent me home my jim"""
"hese are my people
this is a land where my forefathers lie
these are my people
in brotherhood, we're heirs of a creed to live by
a creed that proclaims that byloved one's blood stains
this is my land and these are my people
these are my people
they were born on and lived by the land
these are my people
and their cities were raised by hardworking hands
and their faces do tell that they're holding on well
to this, their land
yes, these are my people
these are my people
these are the ones who will reach for the stars
these are my people
by the light of the earth, you can tell they are ours
a new step to take and a new day will break
for this, my land
yes these are my people"
"bad luck wind been blowing at my back
i was born to bring trouble to wherever i'm at
got the number thirteen tattooed on my neck
when the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red
i was born in the soul of misery
never had me a name
they just gave me the number when i was young
got a long line of heartache
i carry it well
the list of lives
i've broken reach from here to hell
bad luck wind been blowing at my back
i pray you don't look at me, i pray i don't look back
i was born in the soul of misery
never had me a name
they just gave me the number when i was young
i was born in the soul of misery
never had me a name
they just gave me the number when i was young
they just gave me the number when i was young"
"we’re gonna ride the bible train now
no some won’t ride, but we’re going get on the bible train
some ride but not all the way
the bible train is in the yard now and it’s waiting and oh it looks so good
but you might get bored and impatient waiting like those two good brothers over there
they pass around the bottle in the car before they got on the train
just want to take one more for the road and then, that leads to something else
well they ain’t on the train no more and maybe 9 or 10 got off with them
there’s a sister in the church and she says to her friend your husband works at night and so does mine, why don’t we just
get together sometime when they’re gone and go downtown and find us some action, well then they gotta get off the bible train.
and then another man he’s sitting over there looking at a woman in the corner and he’s gives her that eye, you know and they
meet later, secretly, so they got to get off, this train’s got a rule against adultery.
and while all this is happening the train is getting ready to go, but there’s a lot more to get off than different reasons
just before the train pulls out, but listen its starting to move now, listen to it.
here we go….
as it leaves the man on the caboose with a long white beard says,
this train is bound for glory, this train,
this train is bound for glory, this train,
this train is bound for glory nobody rides it but the righteous and holy,
this train is bound for glory, this train
this train is a free train, this train,
this train is a free train, this train,
this train is a free train,
everybody rides in jesus’ name
this train is a free train, this train,
this train it don’t pull no liars, this train
this train don’t pull no liars, this train
this train don’t pull no liars,
no false pretenders and no backbiters
this train don’t pull no liars, this train.
this train is a clean train, this train
this train is a clean train, this train
this train is a clean train,
everybody rides it in jesus’ name
this train is a clean train, this train
do you want to ride it children, this holy train?
do you want to ride it children, this righteous train?
get on board
get on board
get on board
get on board this holy train
get on board
get on board
get on board this holy train"
"there is a rumble in the sky and all the world can hear it call
they shutter at the fury of the mighty thunderball
the power of her engines, now, has drowned in the sea
but the deadly force from within her is somewhere running free
thunderball, your fiery breath can burn the coldest man
and who is going to suffer from the power in your hand
somewhere, there is a man who could stop the thing in time
he is known by very few but he's feared by all in crime
by courage and by fighting, he has not been known to fall
but neither has the fury of the mighty thunderball
thunderball, your fiery breath can burn the coldest man
and who is going to suffer from the power in your hand
money hungry minds need a thread to launch a scheme
but those, who hold the thunderball,
could rule the world, it seems
cannot the peaceful world find the clue to where she's gone
the silent sea won't answer now but terror lingers on
thunderball, your fiery breath can burn the coldest man
and who is going to suffer from the power in your hand"
"now i've got arms

"so you're feeling numb about me being gone
so you see now you're half alive when you're alone
well i just hope the pain will ease a little as you wait

dark days're coming now you see
hard times for you as well as me
all time load is coming under your front gate
you gave me love but too little too late
so you got plans about some fine affair
well think about it a little while while you're lying there
love long and hard and don't make your lover wait

"i have been ungrateful and i have been unwise restless from the cradle but now i realize it's so hard to see the rainbow through glasses dark as these maybe i'll be able from down on my knees
oh i am weak oh i know i am vain take this weight from me let my spirit be unchained
old man swearin' at the sidewalk and i am overcome seems that we've both forgotten forgotten to go home

i wonâ€™t even turn my head.
donâ€™t sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin'
iâ€™ll be gone, like i said.
youâ€™d just say the same old things
that you be sayin'all along,
just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut,
till iâ€™m gone.
donâ€™t give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan
understand your man.
now, you can give my other suit to the salvation army,

"one mornin' at breakfast, i said to my wife,
we been everywhere once and some places twice,
as i had another helping of country ham,
she said ""we ain't never been to vietnam,
""and there's a bunch of our boys over there.""
so we went to the orient: saigon.
well we got a big welcome when we drove in,
through the gates of a place that they call long vinh.
we checked in and everything got kinda quiet,
but a soldier boy said: ""just wait 'til tonight,
""things get noisy. things start happenin'.
""big bad firecrackers.""
well that night we did about four shows for the boys,
and they were livin' it up with a whole lot of noise.
we did our last song for the night,
and we crawled into bed for some peace and quiet,
but things weren't peaceful. and things weren't quiet.
things were scary.
well for a few minutes june never said one word,
and i thought at first that she hadn't heard.
then a shell exploded not two miles away,
she sat up in bed and i heard her say: ""what was that?""
i said: ""that was a shell, or a bomb.""
she said: ""i'm scared."" i said ""me too.""
well all night long that noise kept on,
and the sound would chill you right to the bone.
the bullets and the bombs, and the mortar shells,
shook our bed every time one fell,
and it never let up; it was gonna get worse,
before it got any better.
well when the sun came up, the noise died down,
we got a few minutes sleep, an' we were sleepin' sound,
when a soldier knocked on our door and said:
""last night they brought in seven dead, and 14 wounded.""
and would we come down to the base hospital, and see the boys.
""yes!""
so we went to the hospital ward by day,
and every night we were singin' away.
then the shells and the bombs was goin' again.
and the helicopters brought in the wounded men.
night after night; day after day.
comin' and a goin'.
so we sadly sang for them our last song,
and reluctantly we said: ""so long.""
we did our best to let 'em know that we care,
for every last one of 'em that's over there.
whether we belong over there or not.
somebody over here love's 'em, and needs 'em
well now that's about all that there is to tell,
about that little trip into livin' hell.
and if i ever go back over there any more,
i hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for;
i hope that war is over with,
and they all come back home,
to stay.
in peace."

been out prospectin' for two years or so
pulled into fairbanks the city was a boom
so i took a little stroll to the red dog saloon
as i walked in the door the music was clear
the purtiest voice i had heard in two years
the song she was singin' made a man's blood run cold
when it's springtime in alaska, it's forty below
it was redheaded lil who was singin' so sweet
i reached down and took the snowpacks off my feet
i reached for the gal who was singin' the tune
we did the eskimo hop all around the saloon
with a caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
we did our dance on a kodiak rug
the song she kept singin' made a man's blood run cold
when it's springtime in alaska, it's forty below
i was as innocent as i could be
i didn't know lil was big ed's wife to be
he took out his knife and he gave it a throw
when it's springtime in alaska, i'll be six feet below"

papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go
when company would come around he kept the dobro hid
he knew he couldn't play the way the other players did
why the guitar's resonator was a gallon bucket lid
but papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go
well now that papa's gone away it's hanging by the flue
the top of it's rusted and the strings're rusty too
it won't ever sound the way that it did when it was new

and i heard as it were the noise of thunder
one of the four beasts saying
come and see and i saw
and behold a white horse
there's a man going around taking names and he decides
who to free and who to blame every body won't be treated
quite the same there will be a golden ladder reaching down
when the man comes around
the hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each
sip and each sup will you partake of that last offered cup
or disappear into the potter's ground
when the man comes around
hear the trumpets hear the pipers one hundred million angels singing
multitudes are marching to a big kettledrum
voices calling and voices crying
some are born and some are dying
its alpha and omegas kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn trees
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn trees
it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
till armageddon no shalam no shalom
then the father hen will call his chicken's home
the wise man will bow down before the thorn and at his feet
they will cast the golden crowns
when the man comes around
whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
listen to the words long written down
when the man comes around
hear the trumpets hear the pipers one hundred million angels singing
multitudes are marching to a big kettledrum
voices calling and voices crying
some are born and some are dying
its alpha and omegas kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn trees
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn trees
it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
in measured hundred weight and penny pound
when the man comes around
close
and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
and i looked and behold, a pale horse
and it's name it said on him was death
and hell followed with him."

for although i loved her she would not be my bride

goodbye my bitter white girl i'll forget you if i can

they told me not to love her but i did not care
she took me to her parties she carried me around
and i was a proud one the tallest man in town
for i found great wonder all wrapped in brilliant dreams
i held her strong but gentle as kings have held their queens
i learned to drink strong whiskey as she took me here and there
until life without my whiskey i could not bear
oh goodbye softly sweet one...
well when she came to leave me she took me by the arm
and she said she loved me and would not do me harm
but she would not marry not an indian she said
she thanked me for my offer and i wished that i was dead
now i'm back among my people and they are kind to me

for i've been a white girl's pet a captive indian
shown off and discarded just a drunk who might have been

followed the new star by its heavenly light

who kept the sheep who kept the sheep
did robbers not steal or did they fear the light

did they not stray did little lambs weep who kept the sheep who kept the sheep

on rich bottomed land with twelve kids and a wife

wings in the morning and license to fly
straight to the portals of nevermore die
nevermore pain in them old aching bones
wings in the morning to carry us home
the salt of the earth yet with faith in the lord
they all got together in that one accord
and what could be greater than god's guarantee
that man could have heaven for eternity?

lake michigan wind sure is cold
and i need me a jacket for my shoulders
i could buy one down at the surplus store
cheap cotton twill
with my wrinckled crinckled wadded dollar bill

saw fortunes lost and found
and when your trail failed i walked holes
in both my soles

about your eyes and smiles

i set me down a while

i met you just a while ago
you're welcome for to sit
but calm yourself a bit, sir
calm yourself a bit

i asked the angel to marry me
oh, what a dream

but i'm a dream that can come true
there are dreams of much my worth
that live upon the earth, sir
live upon the earth

you remembered only to count the days till spring
you knew only love and honor but i couldn't see
i regret that i forgot cause you remembered me
i believed that promises were made to break apart
but every time i broke a vow i always broke your heart
so here's to you god bless you now wherever you may be
there were times that i forgot but you remembered me
you remembered only that wedding bells would ring..."
"oh you wild raging river like my woman's lips you lure me
pied piper of the desert roll on to the sea
you're the same at noon or midnight and i follow where you go
but you're planning no returning you wild colorado
if i had no love of life i'd become part of your flow
but i fear the place you'd take me you wild colorado
oh you wild raging river from the fountains of the mountains
you ripple down the valleys growing wide and swift and deep
with what powed you cut your canyons how long ago
you're as wayward as my woman you wild colorado
if i had no love of life..."
"the news is out all over town
that you've been seen out runnin' round
i know that i should leave
but then i just can't go you win again
this heart of mine could never see
what everybody knew but me
just trusting you was my great sin
what can i do you win again
i'm sorry for your victim now c
ause soon his head like mine will bow
he'll give his heart but all in vain
and someday say you win again
you have no heart you have no shame
you take true love and give the blame
i guess that i should not complain
i love you still you win again"
"i can see now that you've stacked the cards so i leave you with my best regards
when you play to feel with nothing left to show look for me you won't have far to go
love's a gamble and i'm a gamblin' man i've done everything to make you understand
but the odds are high and luck is running low look for me you won't have far to go
you won't have far to go if you want me cause i'm gonna stick close to you
and i'm not the kind to say i told you so look for me you won't have far to go
you won't have far to go..."
"well i see you've lost your honey bee
i know how you must be feeling now
you feel sad sad but boy it ain't that bad
you cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
and then you'll be all right
well you know it wasn't long ago
your honey bee was queen of my bee tree
but then away she flew and took my honey to you
you cry just a little bit and die just a little bit and then you'll be all right
i pity you i know what you're going through
you watched your queen bee fly your honeycomb went dry
but if you keep pushin' on you won't care if she's gone
you cry just a little bit and die just a little bit and then you'll be all right
you cry just a little bit and die just a little bit and then you'll be all right"
"when you walk through a storm
keep your chin up high
and don't be afraid of the dark.
when you walk through a storm
keep your chin up high
and don't be afraid of the dark.
at the end of the storm
is a golden sky
and the sweet, silver song of a lark
walk on through the wind,
walk on through the rain,
though your dreams be tossed and blown.
walk on, walk on with hope in your heart,
and you'll never walk alone,
you'll never walk alone."
"you were young and needed love and i was wild and free
but every time you said a prayer you said a prayer for me
why the ring upon your hand we vowed fidelity
there were times when i forgot but you remembered me
you remembered only that wedding bells would ring
you remembered only to count the days till spring
you knew only love and honor but i couldn't see
i regret that i forgot cause you remembered me
i believed that promises were made to break apart
but every time i broke a vow i always broke your heart
so here's to you god bless you now wherever you may be
there were times that i forgot but you remembered me
you remembered only..."
"i love that hair, long an' black
hangin' down in the middle of your back
don't you cut it off whatever you do
cause i need it to run my fingers through
'cause you're my baby, ah ah, you're my sugar
don't mean maybe, you're my baby
hey i got a guitar, got six strings
and a guitar pick that make 'em ring
every string's got a note or two
that i'm gonna use to serenade you
'cause you're my baby, ah ah, you're my sugar
oh you drive me crazy, you're my baby
well i got a dollar that i saved
i saved it up for rainy day
everybody's callin' for bills that's due
but they don't catch me, i'll spend it on you
'cause you're my baby, ah ah, you're my sugar
don't mean maybe, you're my aby
well i had me a gal, she said she's mine
but she run around on me all the time

'cause i i'm plum guggled eyed over you
'cause you're my baby, ah ah, you're my sugar
you drive me crazy
don't mean maybe,
drive me crazy, you're my baby"
"i have sailed the peaceful waters
of the ocean deep and blue
i held my breath and watched
the western sunset's golden hue
i've flown above the mountain peaks
and valley's wide and green
but you're the nearest thing to heaven that i've seen
you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
i have searched for happiness so long and far
but my search for love was through
the day that i found you
'cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
i confess that i've been tempted
by a luring magic charm
when a smile was flashed my way
and stood before two open arms
but i turned and walked away because
i love you like i do
you're the nearest thing to heaven, darling you
you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
i have searched for happiness so long and far
but my search for love was through
the day that i found you
'cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
i have watched the silver raindrops
fall to earth to cool the day
watched the rainbow at twilight
when the clouds had blown away
i loved the pretty flowers
but he cannot buy their worth
but you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth
you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
i have searched for happiness for long and far
but my search for love was through
the day that i found you
'cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are"
