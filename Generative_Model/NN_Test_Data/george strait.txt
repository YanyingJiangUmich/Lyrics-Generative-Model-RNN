in that texas sky
i'll be bucking it to county fair

broke my leg in sante fe
lost my wife and a girlfriend
somewhere along the way
well i'll be looking for eight
when they pull that gate
and i'm hoping that
judge ain't blind

"oh how you sparkle
and oh how you shine
that flush on your cheeks
is more than the wine
and he must do something
that i didn't do
whatever he's doing
it look's good on you
you look so good in love
you want him
that's easy to see
you look so good in love
i wish
you still wanted me
he must have stolen
some stars from the sky
and gave them to you
to wear in your eyes
i had my chances
but i set you free
and now i wonder
why i couldn't see
you look so good in love
you want him
that's easy to see
you look so good in love
i wish
you still wanted me
darlin i wasted a lot of years,
not seeing the real you
but tonight your beauty is shinning through
and i never took the time to let you know
so before he takes you away let me sing
you look so good in love
you want him
that's easy to see
you look so good in love
i wish
you still wanted me"

at first she's gonna come on strong
like she'll love you all night long
like it's going out of style
then she'll leave you with a smile
your gonna give her all your heart
then she'll tear your world apart
your gonna cry a little while
still she'll leave you with a smile
well you can't help but wonder
why you can't help but love her
but you can't help but love her
and all that hurtin' was more than worth it
it's written all over your face
one day you'll pass her on the street
with that guy you used to be
she'll say hello and walk on by

she'd just roll your way again

she's an angel
she's a woman

"her telephone rang bout a quarter to nine
she heard his voice on the other end of the line
she wondered what was wrong this time
she never knew what his calls might bring
with a cowboy like him it could be anything
and she always expected the worst in the back of her mind
he said, ""it's cold out here and i'm all alone
i didn't make the short go again, and i'm comin home
i never got a chance to write or call
and i know this rodeo's been hard on us all
but i'll be home soon and honey is there somethin wrong""
she said, ""don't bother comin home
by the time you get here i'll be long gone
there's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man""
he said, ""i'm sorry it's come down to this
there's so much about you that i'm gonna miss
but it's alright honey if i hurry i can still make cheyenne
gotta go now baby if i hurry i can still make cheyenne""
he left that phone danglin off the hook
then slowly turned and gave it one last look
then he just walked away
he aimed his truck toward that wyoming line
with a little luck he could still get there in time
and in that cheyenne wind he could still hear her say
she never knew what his calls might bring
with a cowboy like him it could be anything
and she always expected the worst in the back of her mind"
"been in the saddle since the sun came up
rounding up strays in, this ol; west texas dust
she's been packing her things since i put coffee on
by sundown she'll be gone
damn this ol' girth, worn right in two
but a spare length of leather and i'll make it do
just when i think i've got life by the reins
home ain't sweet home on the range
if heartaches were horses and hard times were cattle
i'd ride home at sunset, sitting tall in the saddle
if heartaches were horses and hard time were cattle
and she'd say she loved me and this cowboy way of life
she'd be right beside me when we rode home tonight
if heartaches were horses and hard times were cattle
i'd ride home at sunset, sitting tall in the saddle
if heartaches were horses and hard time were cattle"

sing a song about my life

"we loaded up my old station wagon
with a tent, coleman, and sleepin' bags
some fishin' poles, a cooler of cokes
three days before we had to be back
when you're seven, you're in seventh heaven
when you're goin' campin' in the wild outdoors
and as we turned off o that old dirt road,
he looked at me and swore
dad, this could be the best day of my life
i've been dreamin' day and night 'bout the fun we'll have
it's just me and you doin' what i've always wanted to
i'm the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life
well, his fifteenth birthday rolled around
classic cars were his thing
when i pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
i thought that boy would go insane
when you're in your teens
your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
we worked nights on end 'til it was new again
and as he sat behind the wheel, he said
dad, this could be the best day of my life
i've been dreamin' day and night 'bout the fun we'll have
it's just me and you doin' what i've always wanted to
i'm the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life
standin' in a little room
back of the church with our tuxes on
lookin' at him i say
""i can't believe, son, that you're grown""
he said
dad, this could be the best day of my life
i've been dreamin' day and night 'bout bein' like you

as she walked to the door
i couldn't care less
if she didn't care anymore
and with tears in my eyes, i lied
i was glad we were through
as she drove away cryin' at the famous last words of a fool
famous last words of a fool
famous last words of a fool
""you won't break my heart"" and ""i don't love you""
the famous last words of a fool.
the first night without her would be easy

"i got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
fighting was against the rules and it didnt matter why
when dad got home i told that story just like id rehearsed
then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst
and he said, let me tell you a secret, about a fathers love
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
he said daddies dont just love their children every now and then
its a love without end, amen, its a love without end, amen
when i became a father in the spring of 81
there was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my fathers son
and when i thought my patience had been tested to the end
i took my daddys secret and i passed it on to him
and i said, let me tell you a secret, about a fathers love
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
i said daddies dont just love their children every now and then
its a love without end, amen, its a love without end, amen
last night i dreamed id died and stood outside those pearly gates
when suddenly i realized there must be some mistake
if they know half the stuff i done theyll never let me in
then somewhere from the other side i heard these words again
and they said, let me tell you a secret, about a fathers love
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
you see daddies dont just love their children every now and then
its a love without end, amen, its a love without end, amen"

you told me this time and again

just because you've done give up on me
i've tried and i've tried to keep you satisfied
i've give about all i can give

just the way that you feel about me
spendin' and a offendin', never tendin' or mendin'

rainin' the blues on you
like it's never gonna end on you

making love then
getting up
and never having to explain
i've always been free
i never could see me
dragin' no ball and chain
i like running around
and being tied down
never was my cup of tea
but since i've been holding an angel
a little heaven's rubbing off on me
and i'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands
looking into her eyes i'm thinking about future plans
and then i get the feeling that the life that i'd been leading ain't all it's cracked
up to be
since i've been holding an angel
a little heaven's rubbing off on me
i used like
to spend the night
sittin' on an old bar stool
drinkin' wine and killing time
with all over those other fools

i think i understand
it ain't the way it outta be

i need a new beginning, and girl you fit right in
sometimes a new beginning is found in an old friend

"a showman's life is a smokey bar
and the fevered chase of a tiny star
it's a hotel room and a lonely wife
from what i've seen of a showman's life
nobody told me about this part
they told me all about the pretty girls
and the wine and the money and the good times
there's no mention of all the wear and tear
on an old honky tonker's heart
well i might have known it
but nobody told me about this part
a boy will dream as children do
of a great white way, until the dream comes true
and a phony smile in a colored light
is all there is to a showman's life
nobody told me about this part

don't put it all on the line for just one roll
you've got to have an ace in the hole

and you're not sure its the way you wanna go
in money or love or all the above

no matter what you do
no matter where you go

and how he got the bay he rode
he said he killed a man in ohio
first man he killed first horse he stole
it was a long road for arkansas dave
he shot and left him where he lay
said he'd never forget that winter day
he rode off on a streak faced bay
i stood up and i shook his hand
told no one that i knew this man
started thinking up a plan
‘bout how i'd deal him his last hand
didn't take him long to come unwound
he jumped up and gunned two men down
ran outside to leave the town
but ole' bay was nowhere to be found
i head out with my .44
and when he walked back through the door
i shot till i could shoot no more
and dave rudabaugh fell to the floor
it was the end of the road for arkansas dave
i shot and left him where he lay
i'll never forget that winter day
i rode off on the streak faced bay
no i'll never forget that winter day
when i rode home on daddy's streak face bay

"lately i've found myself fallin'
deeper in love with you
i'm not the kind of guy
who gets swept away
so here's what i'm gonna do
i'm gonna give you this heart of mine
but that's where i draw the line
i'm only gonna give you everything
take it a mile beyond the end, of the road
i'm gonna love you one day past forever
but that's as far as it goes
i know it may not sound like much
but baby make no mistake
i'm gonna treat you with more tenderness
than any one woman can take
i'm gonna make all your dreams come true
but after that baby i'm through
i'm only gonna give you everything
take it a mile beyond the end, of the road
i'm gonna love you one day past forever
but that's as far as it goes
you've got your limits, i've got mine
i'm only gonna go the distance
time after time
i'm only gonna give you everything
take it a mile beyond the end, of the road
i'm gonna love you one day past forever

no crib for a bed

"she looked so much like a lady
but she was so much like a child
a devil when she held me close
an angel when she smiled
she always held it deep inside
but somehow i always knew
she'd go away when the grass turned green
and the sky turned baby blue
baby blue was the color of her eyes
baby blue like the colorado skies
like a breath of spring she came and left
and i still don't know why so
here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight
she brought colors to my life
that my eyes had never touched
and when she taught me how to care
i never cared so much
i try not to think of her but i fall asleep and do
and drift off where the grass is green
and the sky is baby blue"
"all you know it all lovers better heed some advice,
if you're bad to your baby, you better think twice.
love don't come easy, love ain't blind.
you've got to show her you love her, morning and night,
be there for her just to make things right.
make her believe till there ain't a doubt in her mind.
chorus:
better baby your baby with a love that's strong,
hold her and tell her you'll never do wrong.
better baby your baby, cause if you don't
one day your baby'll be gone.
don't let her get lonely, don't make her cry,
don't take her for granted, don't tell her a lie.
bring her red roses when she's blue.
give her the best of what you've got to give,
you'll be together as long as you live,
better baby your baby, she'll baby you."
"what a rotten day
this turned out to be
i still can't believe
she'd leave so easily
she just packed all her things
threw them into a pile
then she loaded her car
and said, ""after awhile""
she'd done this before
but this time she didn't cry
chorus:
that's why i'm sitting on the front steps
staring down the road
wondering if she'll come back
this time i don't know
and after she packed
when she looked back
there were no tears in her eyes
and that's got me worried
thinking maybe my baby's
gotten good at goodbye
all the times before
she'd break down and cry
she'd make her threats
but her heart wasn't set on goodbye
she just wanted me to hear
what she had to say
now i'm lost for words
since she went away
she may not return
for this time she didn't cry

like everything is alright
like nobody cried all last night
look at the sun, oh how it's shinin'
almost a picture perfect day
like nobody's going away

she might need me to hold her
but wouldn't you know it the weather is perfect
there's not a cloud in the sky
it ain't rainin' or snowin'
there's no cold wind blowin'
it's a beautiful day for goodbye
isn't it like me to wait ‘til she's leaving
to know how i feel
i love her and i always will
in a second or a moment, forever can change
so i'm standing here praying for rain

rainin' the blues on you

i'll miss your skin, as golden as your wheatfield hair
and where you go i hope you find out there
a better rain
the kind that comes in off the coast and paints the sky
and lets you know that god's alive
a better rain
that'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
and be all right again
in a better rain
someday is gonna find you in a sweeter place
long after time has erased
all the words like razor blades
you'll remember you and me before the flood
once upon a time in love, a beautiful us
i can see you on some stretch of sand
spinin' round in circles barefoot dancin' in
a better rain
that'll leave behind a rainbow in the sky
lets you know that god's alive
a better rain
that'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again

say it's too much guitar music, tequila, salt, and lime

i felt all the pains of a morning after

all lit up man, i just couldn't wait
i picked up the rod
i put it in free spool

and i fed him some line

"i woke up this mornin' and i swore to god
i'd never, ever take another drink again
i fought it like the devil, but you know that you're in trouble
when you're fourteen and drunk by 10am.
tried to hide it from my mom and dad, all my friends said, straighten up
i just laughed, said, you don't understand
that's a hell of a lot to ask a drinkin' man
at sixteen i was on my own and flyin' high
and stayin' stoned
i knew everything there was to know
i did things i can't talk about
i wore my mom and daddy out
late nights they spent prayin' for my soul
stayed sober once for nine days in a row
i quit cold turkey and damn near almost
made it to ten
but that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinkin' man
i look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
i'd like to pour it out, i just don't think i can
'cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinkin' man
i don't know when or where it was or how we met
and fell in love
or why she'd even fall for a guy like me
i tried to pull myself together, hopin' we could last forever
for awhile i started to believe
her daddy said, she's all i got
son, don't ever break her heart
promise me before you take her hand
but that's just too much to ask of a drinkin' man
i look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
i'd like to pour it out, i just don't think i can
'cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinkin' man
i woke up this mornin' and i swore to god
i'd never, ever take another drink again

could leave behind so much
it's just a lot of little things but they mean the world to me
everywhere i look there's one more memory
there's a little bit of you in everything i see
seems to rain now all the time
hadn't seen this much in years
didn't take you long

now there's rose in the garden
but it's the coldest place in town
it took 15 years, goin up
and one night coming down
15 years of heaven
for one short night of sin
from blue skies forever
to an end
from out on a mountain
to both knees on the ground
15 years, goin up
and one night coming down
her dreams have all been shattered
her faith in me not my is gone
my tears tell her i'm sorry
but they can't write  my wrong
one night wrote my story
how a man can lose it all
after 15 years goin up
it's hard to take a fall
15 years of heaven
for one short night of sin
from blue skies forever
to an end
from out on a mountain
to both knees on the ground
15 years, goin up
and one night coming down
i've been, 15 years goin up"
"i'm finding out how hot
an old flame can burn.
you're a feeling i haven't forgot,
the love i can't unlearn.
you've become a memory
i can't live without.
you'll always be a fire
i can't put out.
i don't know how to handle
the dream you left behind.
it's like a lighted candle
burning up my mind.
at least i'm happy knowing
what love is all about.
you'll always be a fire
i can't put out.
    instrumental    
embers to ashes,
that's how it should be.
you’d think by now my heart would know,
and it could set you free.
the things i've tried, the tears i've cried,
i guess there's no doubt
you'll always be a fire
i can't put out
i don't know how to handle
the dream you left behind.
it's like a lighted candle
burning up my mind.
at least i'm happy knowing
what love is all about.
you'll always be a fire
i can't put out.

i can't put out...."

"nickels and dimes
memories and wines
she's on his mind once again
the same old stool
the same old fool
played by the rules but didn't win
there's an old love in his heart that he can't lose
he tried forgettin' but he knows that it's no use
chorus:
he's got a fool hearted memory
but it won't let him see
that she walked out the door
he's got a fool hearted memory
he sits patiently
here every night so it can fool him more
she was his girl
his only whirl
that string of pearls that slipped away
a thousand dimes
a thousand times
he doesn't mind what they say
he fills the jukebox
and plays the same old song
he fills his glass
and then he turns her memory on
but it's a fool hearted memory
it won't let him see
that she walked out the door
he's got a fool hearted memory
he sits patiently
here every night so it can fool him more"

so i sit here while she's staying home
watching dallas on t.v.
i love the taste of whiskey straight,
but the strongest thing she ever takes
is a sip from a small glass of chablis.
though birds of a different feather,
our love keeps us together,
and she knows what's wrong with me tonight,
i've got that friday night fever;
sometimes a man just needs a breather.
she knows i love her and i need her.
and i'm no cheater,
i've just got that friday night fever.
she wouldn't change me if she could, so i wouldn't change her,
she's too good.
sometimes a man just needs a change of pace.
i've heard all those come on lines,
but i go home at closing time.
i know no one could ever take her place
now she's taking down her hair, she knows i'll soon be there.
to give her the love she needs tonight.

"frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
with a corn cop pipe and a button nose
and two eyes made out of coal
frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
he was made out of snow
but the children know how he came to life one day
there must of been some magic in
that ol' silk cap they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around
frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
and the children say he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me
frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day
so he said lets run and have some fun before i melt away
down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
runnin' here and there all around the square
sayin' catch me if you can
he led them down the streets of town
right to the traffic cop
and he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop
frosty the snowman
had to hurry on his way
but he waved goodbye sayin' please don't cry
i'll be back again some day"

i get along with you
well i don't like
people always tellin' me that i should change
they get simple lives
and they think they've got my life to rearrange
but they don't understand
exactly what love boils down to
cause on and on
i get along with you
well all it takes to please me
is waking in the morning feeling you by my side
and all i ever needed
is knowin' that i'm needed in your life
i may not do
all the things that other people want me to
but on and on
i'll get along with you.

"she was stormin' through the house that day
and i could tell she was leavin
and i thought, aw, she'll be back
'til she turned around and pointed at the wall an said
that picture from our honeymoon
that night in frisco bay
just give it away
she said, give it away
and that big four poster king size bed
where so much love was made
just give it away
she said, just give it away
just give it away
there ain't nothin' in this house worth fightin' over
oh, and we're both tired of fightin' anyway
so just give it away
so i tried to move on
but i found that each woman i held
just reminded me of that day
hmmm
when that front door swung wide open
she flung her diamond ring
said, give it away
just give it away
and i said, now, honey, don't you even want
your half of everything
she said, give it away
just give it away
just give it away
there ain't nothin' in this house worth fightin' over
oh, and we're both tired of fightin' anyway
so just give it away

she don't care about anymore

it's true, it's so true when they do you like that
what else you can do but go on.
our conversation won't change nothin', but it's sure nice to talk
with somebody who's been cut out of the same ol' cloth
you know how you said happiness can't be found lookin' back
if you don't mind, maybe we can talk a little more about that.

it's true, it's so true when they do you like that
what else can you do but go on...
even when you see no reason to
don't wait to live life 'cause it won't wait for you

how long can i go on holding my own
there's brand new show that's playing
at the movies down the street
i'll probably go there after work

"walkin’ down this lonely stretch of beach
she and i walked down a thousand times
i just can force myself to give her up
like all the things she left behind
gone are the days, when i'd way up
with her body next to mine.
it gets cold here in the winter time
and my mind drifts away
to that house across the bay
a long talk and a glass of wine
and we’d love the night away
but that was yesterday
in that house across the bay.
her laughter was contagious
her walk, her talk, her smile,
lit up every room.
they say things happen for a reason,
but i can’t find one good reason
why she’s gone so soon.
life just seems to hang
on every thought and everything we used to be.
there was sunshine everyday
and we’d love the night away,
in that house across the bay."
"i was there in my trailer,
down at the job site
the day that this stranger walked in
his face looked so sad, and he carried a set of blueprints
and as i unrolled them, the first thing i noticed
was there were no doors in the plans
he said if you build this for me
then when she comes back
she'll never be able to leave me again
i said if i did
and she ever came back
friend, tell me how would she get in
it would just be a prison that i locked you in
if you couldn't leave
you'd never know if there was someone to love you
the way that she didn't before
there's two things that i know for sure
it's that you can't make a women feel something she don't
and you can't build a house with no doors
o'while he was quiet, i could tell he was thinking
i thought i just ruined his day
i just couldn't bear to see this man's last hope slip away
so i thought real fast, and i started talking
said buddy we tried this before,
and if there ain't one, she'll make one
either way she'll run
and leave you a house with a hole for a door
i said if i did
and she ever came back
friend, tell me how would she get in
it would just be a prison that i locked you in
if you couldn't leave
you'd never know if there was someone to love you
the way that she didn't before
if there's two things that i know for sure
it's that you can't make a women feel something she don't

and if i hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway
i’m sure to get a kiss
and is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow
to complete this singular wish?
it shines, it’s new
i know what i want and nothin’ else will do
this year for christmas i just want to be with you
this year for christmas i just want to be with you"
"sometimes i can't put up with bein' so put down
and all my faith can manage, is the shaow of a frown
my sou's about t break, there's only one escape
chorus:
i look at you, when the world is full of lies
i look at you, and the truth is in your eyes
i look at you, when i lay me down at night
and i wanna see a dream come true
i look at you, and i know i've got it all
you touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall
you ease my troubled mind, i love you more each time
i look at you
you know some days i'm tempted to run away and hide
'cause i can't miss the bad luck that's fallin' from the sky
i'm under som dark cloud, and there's only one way out"
"yes, i know i'm late gettin' home tonight
can supper wait, i quess i lost my appetite
yeah you can fix me a drink, oh anything's okay
oh, by the way i met a friend of yours today
i was workin' on the other side of town
and comin' home i thought i'd stop and have a round
and in this bar i heard someone speak your name
and that's how i met a friend of yours today
i listened for awhile and i could tell
that that stranger there he knew you much to well
and i introduced myself and you should have seen his face
oh what a shame i met a friend of yours today
please don't cry woman 'cause it's much too late for tears
yeah, i'm sorry too 'cause it hurts after all these years
and ain't it sad a love like ours should end this way
and all because i met a friend of yours today"
"your out there somewhere and your crying
and i love you though we've never met
wait there for me, i'll recognize you
someone lonesome, someone hurtin', someone blue,
that'll be you
we'll help each other start all over
a tear for a tear
a shoulder for a shoulder
you'll be someone that's born to lose
'cause i need someone like me
to hold on too
we'll help each other start all over
a tear for a tear
a shoulder for a shoulder
you'll be someone that's born to lose
'cause i need someone like me
to hold on too
'cause i need someone like me"
"just walked down street
to the coffee shop
had to take a break
i'd been by her side
for eighteen hours
straight
saw a flower growin'
in the middle
of the sidewalk
pushin' up
through the con crete
like it was planted
right there for me to see
the flashin' lights
the honkin' horns
all seemed to fade away
in the shadow
of that hospital at 5:08
i saw god today
i've been to church
i've read the book
i know he's here
but i don't look
near as often
as i should
yea
i know i should
his finger prints
are every where
i just slowed down
to stop and stare
opened my eyes
and man, i swear
i saw god today"
"i once had a love, a true and lasting love,
but the fool in me came out one night.
and with her loving eyes
she saw right through my eyes,
and she changed the night
i stepped across the line.
i should have watched that first step
it was a mighty big step
when i started steppin' out of line.
though she's still lovin' me
it's not the way it used to be.
that first step did something to her mind.
i watched her slip away
a little more every day
and my conscience couldn't live
with all that pain.
she's growing colder since the day i told her
and the love we had will never be the same.
i should have watched that first step
it was a mighty big step
when i started steppin' out of line.
though she's still lovin' me
it's not the way it used to be
that first step did something to her mind"
"you said goodbye to me this morning
with only these words to explain
you say you’ve found someone you love better
but i still hear your voice call my name
chorus:
i thought i heard you call my name
funny, i still feel this way.
your voice sounds so near,
but i knew that by now you were many miles away
i walk through the streets of the city
people passing by think it’s so strange
i’m talkin’ but there’s no one here beside me
and i thought i heard you call my name
chorus"
"you say you want to talk it over
want to try again
but there's no way of workin' out
this love that we're not in
we could talk and talk and accomplish nothin'
we've tried it all before
it's time somebody did some walkin'
and i can see the door
so i'd just as soon go
i'd just as soon say goodbye
there's no reason to prolong
what we should just let die
and i'd just as soon stop
i'd just as soon end the madness
knowin' what i know
i'd just as soon go
it's not an easy thing to do
leavin' seldom ever is
but stayin' just to see us through
just ain't no way to live
it's hard for you to understand
but we're better off this way
i can't fake it one more night
or take it one more day
so i'd just as soon go
i'd just as soon say goodbye
there's no reason to prolong
what we should just let die
and i'd just as soon stop
i'd just as soon end the madness
knowin' what i know
i'd just as soon go
knowin' what i know
i'd just as soon go"
"heard somebody speak her name
they said she was still lookin fine
i could feel that same old flame
i once felt when she was mine
always thought that i was missin somethin
but i found out much too late
therell never be another who loved me that way
chorus:
i'd like to have that one back
i've never known someone so true
and a love thats pure and sweet
is what a man should never lose
and if my lips had said im sorry
she might have stopped right in her tracks
now i find my poor heart saying
i'd like to have that one back
i can almost see her standin there
tears rollin down her face
as she packed away her memories
in that old worn out suit case
if i'd only known then what i know now
i'd never open that door
oh they just dont make hearts like her's any more
chorus
i wouldn't here my poor heart sayin
i'd like to have that one back
i wouldn't here my poor heart sayin
i'd like to have that one back"
"you can turn me loose, tear me up and run me down
cause me shame, drag my name all over town
makes no difference what you say or what you do
as for me i'll always be lovin' you
my love for you was not built on shifting sands
i made a promise long ago and it still stands
go on and do what your heart tells you to
as for me i'll always be lovin' you
you can change your dreams, change your heart
or change your mind
and just pretend that it all ends with your goodbye
you can walk out and forget the love we knew
as for me i'll always be lovin' you"
"it all started back in 1981.
our life together had just begun.
i didn't know what my future would hold,
but you gave me a chance,
so i set out on the road.
it wasn't easy going then.
there were times i almost threw that old towel in,
but you kept callin me back to the stage,
and i finally found my place in each and every face.
i'm not sayin i'm through by any means.
there's still things that i want to say and do.
i hope you won't forget me, cause we've shared a lot dreams.
and just know that i'll always remember you.
when i first set out on the road, i figured
i had maybe 5 good years to sing my songs for you folks.
well, it's goin on 30 now
and i still love it just as much as i ever did.
when i hear that announcer say my name,
and i walk through those curtains
and see your smilin' faces,
my feet don't touch the ground again
til i walk out and get back on that bus that got me here.
i don't know how many more years i've got left to do this,
but i figure a few.
i do want you to know, though,
that when i do walk off this stage for the last time,
and i'm all settled in, away from all this,
you won't be far away.
i'll still hear your screams and cheers in my mind.
and i'll always remember you.
i'm not sayin i'm through by any means.
cause there's still things that i want to say and do.
i hope you won't forget me, cause we've shared a lot dreams.
and just know that i'll always remember you.
you've pulled me through some hard times.
hope i've pulled you through a few.
and just know that i'll always remember you.

"well,hope is an anchor, and love is a ship
time is the ocean and life is a trip
you don't know where you're goin' 'til you know where you're at
and if you can't read the stars, well you better have a map
a compass and a conscience soul so you don't get lost at sea
or on some old lonley island where no one wants to be
from the begining of creation i think our maker had a plan,
for us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
and let the good light guide us through the waves and the wind,
to the beaches in the world where we have never been
and we'll climb up on the mountain y'all and we'll let our voices ring
those who've never tried it, they'll be the first to sing
oh my my
first chorus:
so i'll see you on the other side, if i make it
it might be a long hard ride
but im gonna take it
sometimes it seems that i dont have a prayer
let the weather take me anywhere
but i know that i wanna go where the streets are gold
cause you'll be there
oh my my
well you don't take nothing with you here
and you can't take nothing back
i ain't ever seen a hearse with a luggage rack
so i've torn my knees up praying, scarred my back from falling down
i've spent so much time flying high til i'm face first in the ground
so if you're up there watching me, would you talk to god and say
tell him i might need a hand to see you both someday
oh my my
second chorus:
so i'll see you on the other side, if i make it

the moon is shining through the window pane
i hear the echo of a passing train
taking someone's lover far away
but in your arms is where i wanna stay
tonight i'm the luckiest man in the world
wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl
and now that i've found you
i'm never gonna let you go
let your hair fall across your breast
show me the warmth of your soft caress
the music's playin' soft and slow
we're driftin' into the afterglow
tonight i'm the luckiest man in the world
wrapped in the arms of a beautiful girl

you don't wear diamond rings,

you look just like an angel but you haven't got wings,

i'd rather have you just the way that you are
than change you for somebody new.
maybe i could do better if i reached for a star,
but i'm satisfied with you.
you're not made out of candy
but you're as sweet as you can be
so i'm satisfied with you.
i just can't see no reason why you bother with me,
but i'm satisfied with you.
i often wonder if it's all a mistake;
it's hard to believe that it's true.

"so upset
nervous wreck
i can't believe she said goodbye

cry and joke
about these tears in my eyes

how could you do what you gone and done to me
i wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me
but that's what i get
i've come to expect it from you
a million times
a million lines and i bought 'em every one
you don't care
you rip and tear every dream i've counted on

that i'm alive
and you're the way you are

i've come to expect it from you

i could raise hell

"full moon friday night after the game
stars must have all lined up early that day
i just turned 17, she had me by a month
we were young, we were green to the taste, to the touch
from that very first kiss
it was like we were born for that moment
caught up in the perfect storm
it came in like a flood over the gate
swallowed us up and it swept us away
we were over our heads, me and that girl
we were out of our minds, it was out of this world
it was always too much, it was never enough
it was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
it was love
we reigned like the king and the queen of the land
everyone wanted some of what we had then
yeah, we were the ones they all talked about
like we were the fire that would never go out
it came in like a flood over the gate
swallowed us up and it swept us away
we were over our heads, me and that girl
we were out of our minds, it was out of this world
it was always too much, it was never enough
it was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
it was love
we knew it was coming, still, it came way too soon
neither one knew what to say or to do
so, we just let the radio play while we danced
we laughed and we cried like i never have since
it came in like a flood over the gate
swallowed us up and it swept us away
we were over our heads, me and that girl
we were out of our minds, it was out of this world
it was always too much, it was never enough
it was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up
it was love
it was love
it was love
it was just the kind of stuff you just can't make up"
"the first time i met her,
she walked right up to me.
and said, ""you're who i wanted to find.""
there was a man she had seen in her dreams.
and it was me.
she said, ""i can't believe it.
'cause i've never been in here,
and i've passed this place so many times.""
it was her night to find destiny,
and it was me.
:
and we danced every song that they played,
and talked until closing time.
the closer i held her,
the more i knew her destiny.
wasn't that far from mine.
than i saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar.
looking back when i looked in her eyes.
the happiest man i'd ever seen,
and it was me.
:
she wasn't looking,
and i wasn't looking.
ain't it funny?
that's when love was found.
she still calls it her lucky night,
yeah, someone was lucky.
she's right,
but it was me"
"chorus
it's alright with me, if it's alright with you
it's alright i know your love will see me through
when the car won't start, the rain won't stop
and all of the bills are due
it's alright with me, if it's alright with you
well, the boss man rides me all week long
and it's all that i can take
i work each day 'til the sun is gone
and no time for a break
but when i get home, you rub my back
and tell me i'm your man
with a little love, i get back on track
and do it all over again
chorus
no matter what life throws at me
i've got the other hand
'cause nothing else can set me free
the way your lovin' can
if i lived in a shack out in the woods
and never seen me blue
i'd just throw another log in the old wood stove
and make sweet love to you
chorus"
"remember how lonely i told you it would be
without you here with me
but you just turned and walked away
and now that i've found somebody new
you've changed your tune
you want me back but all i can say
chorus:
it's too late now
just tell me how long did you think
i'd be your fool
and i would sit right here an' wait
for you to make up
your mind to show up
well, just turn around
i'm sorry it's too late now
well didn't i tell you that one of these days
it would be too late
to say you'd made a big mistake
and now you've come back like you've never been gone
well baby you're wrong
somebody else has taken your place

jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring
snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
now the jingle hop has begun
jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
dancing and prancing in jingle bell square
in the frosty air
what a bright time, it’s the right time
to rock the night away
jingle bell time is a swell time
to go gliding in a one horse sleigh
giddy up jingle horse, pick up your feet
jingle around the clock
mix and a mingle in the jingling feet
that’s the jingle bell,
that’s the jingle bell,
that’s the jingle bell rock"

one look at you
and just look at me
held under your spell
so helplessly
yes i'm still your fool

one look at you

but i guess it's too soon
the truth was so plain to see
tonight when you walked in the room
i just couldn't control the tears
when i saw you again
my love is still as strong for you
as it's ever been

i'm still your fool
guess i'll always be

played the part, i heard he was sad and lived alone, it's not right but lefty's

folks stayed home in one but he sang just the same, i caught a chill before i

i've always been free i never could see me dragin' no ball and chain
i like running around and being tied down never was my cup of tea

and i'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands
looking into her eyes i'm thinking bout future plans
and then i get the feelin' that the life that i'd been leadin'
ain't all it's cracked up to be
since i've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me
i used like to spend the night sittin' on an old barstool
drinking wine and killing time with all over those other fools

a little boat a little beach

a blue ocean view

living and living well
you can't have it all
all by yourself
something's always missing
'til you share it with someone else
there's a difference in living and living well
'til you sailed with me
thought that i had it good
as good as it could be
from the back of my deck
caught a fish caught a breeze
and a thousand red sunsets
but sitting here with you girl i just saw
the best one yet
there's a difference in
living and living well
you can't have it all
all by yourself
something's always missing
'til you share it with someone else
there's a difference in living and living well
my days are brighter
my sky a deeper blue
my nights are sweeter

hard to get through, since you?ve gone

friends stop by to check in ?cause i?ve checked out
i tell them i?m fine,
i?m just living for the night

daylight can't hide the tears i cry
the pain that came with your goodbye
the memories that keep me out of sight
every night i venture out
into those neon arms that hold me tight
i?m living for the night
i?m a whole lot easier to talk to,
when i?ve had a few and settled down
whiskey kills the man you?ve turned me into
and i come alive
i?m living for the night

daylight can't hide the tears i cry
the pain that came with your goodbye
the memories that keep me out of sight

"at a truck stop in st angelo
saw a bill board about this rodeo
this weekend out in el paso
so i signed up to ride
i drew a bull called “original sin”
heard he’d killed a couple of men
figured this was something i could win
cause the devil was on my side
i was havin’ myself one hell of a ride
but i ended up disqualified
that bull just up and died
before they blew the whistle
with those north texas blues,
thought id paid all my dues
then those south texas blues,
told me “son, you ain’t through”
had the east texas blues and the west texas too
i’ve done all i know to do,
tryin to lose, tryin to lose,
these ol’ lone star blues.
well i got laid off at brown and root
then on my way back to cut'n'shoot
i lost my wrist watch and my boots
shootin’ dice with a dude from houston
well there ain’t no jobs here workin’ cattle
so i got on the part time haulin’ gravel
with some outfit from seattle out here building custom homes
well i gassed my truck and i packed my clothes
turned in my key and i hit the road
i said “cow town’s where i’ll go,
you never know, i might get lucky!”
well i got a friend there turning knobs
at a place called billy bobs
said thought he could get me a job there
workin’ as a bouncer
first night on the job was just insane
some ol’ boy got all deranged
hit me in the head with a harley chain
to this day, my ears still ring!
i’ve done all i know to do,
tryin to lose, tryin to lose

riding in the rodeo
my wife left me five years ago
in one of those rodeo towns

there was a time i used to do alright
and bring home my share of the dough

did it humble you when you rode back on that greyhound
you picked a plastic rose and left a field of daisies

you don't feel like being alone
and you find yourself inclined to look around.
for the feelings we once shared
are just no longer there
and love comes from the other side of town.
where love means just an hour
with your stand in
and not an empty house
where love just has been.
since everything we've built with love
was not on solid ground
now love comes from the other side of town.
the life i'm livin' now
just don't seem right somehow
but it's the best way
to get by that i've found.
there's no love left at home

"i got sent home from school one day
with a shiner on my eye
fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
when dad got home i told that story just like i'd rehearsed
then stood there on those tremblin' knees
and waited for the worst
he said, ""let me tell you a secret about a father's love
a secret that my daddy said was just between us""
he said, ""daddies don't just love their children
every now and then, it's a love without end, amen
it's a love without end, amen""
when i became a father in the spring of '81
there was no doubt that stubborn boy
was just like my father's son
and when i thought my patience
had been tested to the end
i took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him
i said, ""let me tell you a secret about a father's love
a secret that my daddy said was just between us""
i said, ""daddies don't just love their children
every now and then it's a love without end, amen
it's a love without end, amen""
last night i dreamed i died and stood outside those pearly gates
when suddenly i realized there must be some mistake
if they know half the things i've done
they'll never let me in
then somewhere from the other side i heard those words again
they said, ""let me tell you a secret about a father's love
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
you see, daddies don't just love their children
every now and then it's a love without end, amen
it's a love without end, amen"""

another town along the highway
i never meant to fall for you
but i can't speak for you, maria
i only know the way i feel
when i sleep with you, maria
there's nothing' left for dreams to steal
on a bible by the mirror
the only treasures that we hold
the only secrets that we're keepin'
a watch, a chain, a cross of gold
but i can't speak for you, maria
i only know the way i feel
when i sleep with you, maria
there's nothing' left for dreams to steal
when the sunlight brings the mornin'
i can't tell you what i'll do
but i've a mind to take you with me
and i've a heart to stay with you
but i can't speak for you, maria
i only know the way i feel
when i sleep with you, maria
there's nothing' left for dreams to steal
when i sleep with you, maria"
"we said goodbye
in marina del rey
""i had a good time""
was the last thing i heard her say
as i walked away
and on this plane back to tennessee
my mind comes across her memory
and yesterday
in marina del rey
chorus:
on a hidden beach under a golden sun
she spread a blanket
that we laid down on and loved the world away
in marina del rey
and as we looked into each other's eyes
we found our body's lost in paradise
like castaways
in marina del rey
like the ocean tides
high and lows
love sometimes comes and goes away
in marina del rey
and as this plane is touching down
tears touch my eyes for i have found
my heart has stayed
in marina del rey
chorus"
"she sparkles, she dazzeles
she lights up the room
we walk together
to a table for two
every man stares
but her eyes are only for me
we take to the dance floor
she squezzes my hand
i can't believe
just how lucky i am
meanwhile
back in the back of my memory
you're still dancing with me
and i'm holding you once again
meanwhile
we move to the end of a beautiful night
tender the kisses
soft candle light
she draws the curtains
and slowly we climb up the stairs
and reach for each other
the passion begins
we fall together
as lovers and then
meanwhile
back in the back of my memory
you're still lying with me
and i'm holding you once again
i try and i try
lord knows i do
but each time my heart
beats back to you
meanwhile
i'll go on living my life now
i'll find a way somehow
oh but
meanwhile
back in the back of my memory
you'll always be with me
but i'll never hold you again
meanwhile"
"i had no reason for shopping this season
but i hung your stocking today
it makes me feel better
though we’re not together
you’ll always be in my heart
merry christmas, wherever you are
since it was christmas
i thought you might call
or have you stopped thinkin’ about me at all
it’d be a perfect white christmas
a storybook picture
if i could just share it with you

"it's christmas time
i see the lines of people everywhere
tryin' to pick out the gifts
that show how much they care
it makes me wish that i could see my friends
on christmas day
and fill my list with lots of gifts
but i can only say
here comes a merry chritmas strait to you
i hope it cheers you up when you are down and feelin' blue
right or wrong i'll sing my song
and you will know just who
sings a merry christmas strait to you
there's lot of ways to share the days
of christmas with your friends
a christmas card, a tree, the star
and gifts that make you grin
i'd like to share this song with everyone who came our way
without a doubt the fires not out
it burns for you today
so here's a merry chritmas strait to you
i hope it cheers you up when you are down and feelin' blue
you've been so kind, to cross my mind
and nothing less will do
here's a merry christmas strait to you
here comes a merry christmas
and to all who might of missed us"
"way out here you can see for miles
if there was anything to be seen
maybe i could tell the difference between
where i am and where i've been
so if i stare off in the distance sometimes
and get that far away look in my eye
it's that my baby went and left me out there
all alone in the middle of nowhere
way out in the middle of nowhere
oh nobody wants to go there
my baby's gone and she don't care
that i'm out here in the middle of nowhere
standin' at the edge of the sky
on top of a mountain so tall
wishing to god i could fly
when i ain't even done climbing the wall
could you help me let the teardrops roll
awe anything to cleanse my soul
or if you've got a single raindrop to spare
lord i'm out in the middle of nowhere
way out in the middle of nowhere
oh nobody wants to go there
my baby's gone and she don't care
that i'm out here in the middle of nowhere"

"nobody saw him running from sixteenth avenue.
they never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was used.
but someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul.
they got away with murder down on music row.
the almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame
slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang
.
they all say not guilty, but the evidence will show
that murder was committed down on music row.
chorus:
for the steel guitars no longer cry and fiddles barely play,
but drums and rock 'n roll guitars are mixed right up in your
face.
old hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio
since they committed murder down on music row.
they thought no one would miss it, once it was dead and gone
they said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating
songs well there ain't no justice in it and the hard facts are cold
murder's been committed down on music row.
chorus:
oh, the steel guitars no longer cry and you can't hear fiddles
play
with drums and rock 'n roll guitars mixed right up in your face
why, the hag, he wouldn't have a chance on today's radio
since they committed murder down on music row
why, they even tell the possum to pack up and go back home
there's been an awful murder down on music row."
"some folks got nothing but trouble
so little joy in their lives
but wherever we go happiness follows
we must be lovin' right
it might be the way i adore you
or the way that you hold me tight
i don't know the reasons girl i'm believing
we must be lovin' right
all our friends say love fades away with time
but i know their wrong
'cause they've never known
a love like yours and mine
so if the whole world goes crazy
let everyone else fuss and fight
when all is said and done, we'll be the lucky ones
we must be lovin' right
some folks got nothin' but troubles
so little joy in their lives
but wherever we go happiness follows
we must be lovin' right
we must be lovin' right"

well honey don't you worry i don't need no ballroom queen,
though i'll admit she sure know how to fill a pair of jeans,
and i'll admit now darlin she sure showin me her stuff
but honey it ain't nearly enough,
1st. chorus
cause i ain't never seen her patch a pair of ragged britches

now honey you know i honor all the hard times we been through
i never could have made it with anyone but you

no i aint never seen her make a six room house a castle
teach the young ones how to wrastle,

were the headlights on my pickup

she leaves the jukebox smoking
everywhere she's been
there's ashes on the ground

through the teardrops in my eyes
my old flame's out burning
another honky tonk down
so country, young and pretty
she's never been no where before

with the girls out on the town

i know exactly what you found
what about your home?

"leon dixon leaves his christmas lights up all year ‘round
it’s somethin’ different about our town
we’ve often wondered why he never takes ‘em down
but leon leaves his christmas lights up all year ‘round
there’s a big bright noel flashin’ off and on
in the yard where the children play the whole year long
we’ve all gotten used to it year by year
now it’s kinda gotten to be a part of things ‘round here
chorus:
peace on earth, good will to men
christmas time is here again
can it be all that wrong
to feel like christmas all year long
leon got sick, it’s been back awhile
short on luck and money, but he still wore that smile
and nobody could stand to see him do without
so we all drove over to see if we could help out
yeah, the noel flashed on and the bills stayed paid
i felt so warm as we drove away
i had never seen christmas spelled so clear
as when i saw “leon” flashin’ in my rear view mirror

from my front porch you can see the sea
i've got some ocean front property in arizona
an if you'll buy that i'll throw the golden gate in free

the ground you walk on

couldn't ask for better weather,
to do what i do:
oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.
so let's go grab a blanket,
an' a hot cup of coffee,
and sit out on the front porch and swing.
that look in your eyes is what's on my mind:
we don't have to say anything.
let's just listen to that old tin roof sing.
an' oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.
when you're in my arms, i've got sunshine,

i’m gonna meet a lot of resistance
it takes every ounce of strength we’ve got

it’s one day at a time

one foot in front of the other
take one step and then take another
keep on walkin’, we’re headed in the right direction

and the road behind don’t matter
but every mile along the way
is just another mile together
unconcerned about the twists and turns
we’re takin’ it nice and slow
safe and sound, covering ground
steady as she goes

yesterday is dead and gone
and tomorrow takes care of itself
we’ll just keep on keepin’ on

made me feel brave and strong
bulletproof, like i could do no wrong
but i found out before too long
what i should've known
you can learn to love anything
even a bird in a cage will sing a song
even it's wrong
even if it kills you in the end
you can learn to love anything
trade your heart and soul for a ball and chain
anything can bring you pleasure, even pain
pick your poison
poison
pick your poison
ruby lips hid a razor tongue
and heart, blue as glacier ice
i was warned, but i was willing
to ignore everybody's advice
the more i gave, the more she took
she walked away without a second look
just one more page from the great big book
on how
you can learn to love anything
even a bird in a cage will sing a song
even if it's wrong
even if it kills you in the end
you can learn to love anything
trade your heart and soul for a ball and chain
anything can bring you pleasure, even pain
you can learn to love anything
a prison wall, a ball and chain
anything can bring you pleasure, even pain
pick your poison
poison
pick your poison
pick your poison
pick your poison
poison
poison
pick your poison
pick your poison

"i know the end is near:
i've seen the warning signs.
been preparin' myself,
layin' in supplies.
i bought a case of jack,
a boxed set of merle:
i'm gettin' ready,
ready for the end of the world.
i'm gettin' ready for the end to come:
that final hour it all comes undone.
an' she drops the bomb:
an' says he ain't my girl.
i'm gettin' ready,
ready for the end of the world.
instrumental break.
my neon shelter waits,
where i can go to hide.
while the memories burn,
i'll be safe inside.
with the honky tonk few,
bracin' for the worst:

"girl you were always my yellow rose
and i was your one lone star
we always said
together till death do us part
we had a love bigger than texas
where is that feeling now
it's taken some hits and losses but it's fighting on
and standing somehow
remember the man who asked for your hand
in the moonlight of san antone
there by the mission you let your position be known
that you loves me so
don't forget where it started
remember the alamo
i think we can hold on and make it together
if we remember when
and get back to love
the way that it was back then
when we were hopeless romantics needing each other
willing to take a chance
we strolled and we talked down the ol' river walk
to the heart of where it began
remember the man who asked for your hand
in the moonlight of san antone
there by the mission you let your position be known
that you loves me so
don't forget where it started
remember the alamo"
"i'd rather be home,
but i make my livin' on the go
big silver eagle spreads her wings
and drops us at another show
i think about holdin' my baby tonight
as i listin to the big wheels roll
three days into a six week tour,
gettin' in the rhythm of the road
we pick and sing,
say ""goodnight"" then we'll be flyin'
my world's a chain of one night stands
strung together by the center line
i don't know where i'll wake up tomorrow,
but i can't let the tempo slow
every town is just another beat,
livin' in the rhythm of the road
the rhythm of the road's got a mind of its own
if you find it it'll drive you insane
like the clackity clack of a railroad track
i'm rattlin' like an old freight train
towns are flashin' by, the folks are wavin' ""hi""
they all start to look the same
gotta stop for a minute, be glad i'm in it
remember just why i came
those highway signs, lord, they keep me on the move
i think about givin' it up sometimes,
and gettin' in a diff'ren groove
but i just let the days slide by,
get goin' with the flow
a four/four beat's the only time i keep,
livin' in the rhythm of the road
a four/four beat's the only time i keep,
livin' in the rhythm of the road
livin' in the rhythm of the road"
"right or wrong i'll always love you
though your're gone i can't forget
right or wrong i'll keep on dreaming
still i wake with the same old regret
all along i knew i'd lose you
though i prayed that you'd be true
in your heart please just remember
right or wrong, i'm still in love with you.
all along i knew i'd lose you

"hey baby, won't you take a little ride with me.
have a look around,
see what we can see.
i've got the paddle,
i've got the boat.
come on baby, i know she'll float.
:
we'll go rolling on the river of love,
we'll go rolling on the river of love.
drift away from all these city lights,
might rock a little bit,
so hold on tight.
let's get carried away with the gentle flow.
might get caught up in its undertow.
we'll go rolling on the river of love,
let's go rolling on the river of love.
i got a little ukulele, let me sing you a song.
got a stream of kisses about ten miles long.
dancing on the water in the moonlight beach.
sparkling down through the sea of dreams.
:
river of love, river of love, river of love.
rolling on the river of love,
let's go rolling, rolling on the river of love.
let's go rolling on the river of love.

"rock, paper, scissors
sittin' on the table in the kitchen
that's all he's got left since she got gone
it goes hand in hand with the memory of doing her wrong
she slipped that ring off her finger
slapped that ink on a goodbye note
she cut his face outta every picture
lost his last name but won the game of
rock, paper, scissors
bouncing on the table as he pounds it double fisted
he's blowing up her phone but it ain't gonna change a thing
'cause there ain't gonna be no best two out of three
she slipped that ring off her finger
slapped that ink on a goodbye note
she cut his face outta every picture
lost his last name but won the game of
when she found him passed out on couch
with lipstick on his cheek
there was nothing left but take a breath
and one, two, three
she slipped that ring off her finger
slapped that ink on a goodbye note
she cut his face outta every picture
lost his last name but won the game of
rock, paper, scissors

"the first time i saw you
you were waitin' tables at the corner diner
i said to myself
never seen a woman look any finer
from that moment on
i was stone cold gone
you wuld be forever in my mind
now somewhere in the neon lights
i'm holdin' on for dear life
rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
it was san francisco
silly sutis and white ties by the bay
you appeared with your papa
tears were rolin' down your mother's face
everyone was happy
showered by well wishers as we drove away
now somewhere in the neon lights
i'm holdin' on for dear life
rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
i'm living but dying
i'm laughing but crying
somebody tell me it will be alright
i bought it for your birthday
god you looked so lovely in that dress
i took you to a party
or was it to a night club i forget
been twenty years and counting
i'm drowning in your love a little more each day
now somewhere in the neon lights
i'm holdin' on for dear life
rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight
now somewhere in the neon lights
i'm holdin' on for dear life
rockin' in the arms of your memory tonight"
"as far as all my friends can tell i took her leavin' well
that's kinda right
'cause when i'm out with them
i don't let her memory
rule the night
for the most part i'm okay
but i still miss her in a round about way
around about the time that midnight rolls around
that's around about the time my tears start fallin' down
cause she's not around
i come unwound and my heart breaks
yeah, i still miss her in a round about way
i no longer sit alone for hours by the phone
wishin she would call
and just the other day i took her smilin' face
down off my wall
i've come a long long way
but i still miss her in a round about way"
"you know dasher and dancer, and prancer and vixen,
comet and cupid, and donner and blitzen,
but do you recall, the most famous reindeer of all?
rudolph the red nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose,
and if you ever saw it,
you could even say it glows.
all of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call him names;
they never let poor rudolph
join in any reindeer games.
then one foggy christmas eve,
santa came to say:
“rudolph with your nose so bright,
won’t you guide my sleigh tonight?”
then how the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee,
“rudolph the red nosed reindeer,
you’ll go down in history."""

now, i don't want to jump into anything
i've been tryin' to use some self restraint
but man it's amazin'
she's the same kind of crazy as me
it's gettin' hard to use a ladder 'cause i keep climbing down, just to kiss her
'cause she's out of my sight for a minute or two, i start to miss her
we stay all tangled up in each other's arms, and it's so nice
she talks in her sleep, but she always gets my name right
if there's anything at all that's wrong with her
it's somethin' that i can't see
ain't no doubt about it
she's the same kind of crazy as me
wild, wild nights, chasin' each other through the moonlight
my, my, my i finally got somethin' right
'cause every little off beat move she makes
suits me to a tee

"i left, out of tucson, with no destination in mind.
i was runnin' from trouble and the jail term the judge had in mind.
and the border meant freedom, a new life, romance,
and that's why i thought i should go,
and start my life over on the seashores of old mexico.
my first night in juarez, lost all the money i had.
one bad senorita made use of one innocent lad.
but i must keep on runnin'; it's too late to turn back:
i'm wanted in tucson, i'm told.
yeah, an' things'll blow over on the seashores of old mexico.
two mexican farmers en route to a town i can't say,
let me ride on the back of a flatbed half loaded with hay.
down through durango, colima, almiera,
then in the manzanillos,
where i slept on the seashores of old mexico.
after one long siesta, i came wide awake in the night.
i was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight.
my new found companion, one young senorita,
who offered a broken hello,
to the gringo she found on the seashores of old mexico.
she spoke of sonora and swore that she'd never return,
for her mexican husband, she really had no great concern.
'cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo:
that's all i needed to know.
yeah, i found what i needed on the seashores of old mexico.
yeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo:
that's all i needed to know, ha, ha.

this woman you want and crave
is the queen of my kingdom
when she walks through the garden
roses drop pedals
to cushion the foot steps she takes
i know she once loved you
and i know you still lover her
but you carlessly asked for your freedom
i can see how it hurts you
but it's too late
you made your mistakes
man you know second chances these days
are so hard to come by
i love that lady
so you best forget
ever gettin' her back cause she's mine

are so hard to come by

"you played me for a fool
and i played the part so well
you played it smart, you played it cool
broke every promise, every rule
and i couldn't even tell
you looked me in the eyes
and said, i was the only one
it was no surprise
that i kept falling for your lies
and they had only just begun
fool me once, shame on you
you told me that you would be true
you were so easy to believe
fool me twice, shame on me
i thought i'd won your heart
but you were still in love with him
you said we'd never be apart
it was a lie right from the start
you left me hanging on this limb
i never thought that you could be
the kind to hurt me just for fun
but it's sure no fun for me
i think it's time to set you free
pick myself up and say we're done
fool me once, shame on you
you told me that you would be true
you were so easy to believe
fool me twice, shame on me
you were so easy to believe

thought she might do some cryin': lose some sleep at night.

to vegas once, then to honolulu.
let herself go to new york city:
a week at the spa; came back knocked out pretty.

she let herself go.
she poured her heart an' soul into their three bedroom ranch.
spent her days raisin' babies, ironin' his pants.
came home one day from the grocery store and found his note,
and without him there to stop her, she let herself go.
let herself go on her first blind date:
had the time of her life with some friends at the lake.
let herself go, buy a brand new car,
drove down to the beach he always said was too far.

makes you feel just like stars on the water
just like stars on the water

where his blood and sweat and tears are still in that red dirt

full of curves lessons learned at every bend
goin's rough unlike the straight and narrow

different drummer

and it all might come unraveled
on the road less traveled

for those who choose to play it safe and never stray too far
me i want to live my life and one day leave my mark

"i left, out of tucson, with no destination in mind.
i was runnin' from trouble and the jail term the judge had in mind.
and the border meant freedom, a new life, romance,
and that's why i thought i should go,
and start my life over on the seashores of old mexico.
my first night in juarez, lost all the money i had.
one bad senorita made use of one innocent lad.
but i must keep on runnin'; it's too late to turn back:
i'm wanted in tucson, i'm told.
yeah, an' things'll blow over on the seashores of old mexico.
two mexican farmers en route to a town i can't say,
let me ride on the back of a flatbed half loaded with hay.
down through durango, colima, almiera,
then in the manzanillo,
where i slept in the sunshine on the seashores of old mexico.
after one long siesta, i came wide awake in the night.
i was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight.
my new found companion, one young senorita,
who offered a broken hello,
to the gringo she found on the seashores of old mexico.
she spoke of sonora and swore that she'd never return,
for her mexican husband, she really had no great concern.
'cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo:
that's all i needed to know.
yeah, i found what i needed on the seashores of old mexico.
yeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo:
that's all i needed to know, ha, ha.
yeah, i found what i needed on the seashores of old mexico.

"the band had just started when they walked in the door
he sat her at a table and strolled out on the floor
he grabbed the first sweet thang that gave him the eye
and left the door open for the steal of the night
three dances later she was still in her chair
he was still on the dance floor like he didn't care
so i eased on over, there was no ring in sight
and i found myself facing the steal of the night.
she was the steal of the night,
oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
he long hair flowing and her jeans so tight
i held her close and it felt so right
she was the steal of the night
oh yeah, she was the steal of the night
he left her lonely and the pickings were right
she was the steal of the night
we danced every slow one the band could play
was it ever this easy for ole jesse james
had the gold in my hands and the banker was blind
just inches away from the steal of the night
when the band stopped playing we walked to the car
as i closed the door he ran out of the bar
saw him shaking his fist under the parking lot light
as i strolled away with the steal of the night"
"i had a love and it was all mine
i drove her out, i must've been blind
that's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud
she loved me so, but i was untrue
she's gone for good, what can i do
that's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud
there's not a thing that i can say about her
except i don't know how i'm going to live without her
i had a love and it was all mine
i watched it fade a kiss at a time
that's the thoughts of a fool thinking out loud

"we're looking for the king
the new messiah
we're following the star shining brighter
old man won't you help us if you can

but he pointed his hand
there's a new kid in town

there's a new kid in town
but he's just another baby i suppose, heaven knows
there's a new kid in town
here in bethlehem
i see you've traveled far
bearing tresures
you say these gifts are for the new kings pleasure
i've heard that a king might come
but up till now there hasn't been one"
"he was sitting on the front porch of a half way house
chainin' cigarettes and drinkin' coffee
i was walkin' by on my way home
stopped and said, hello, how are ya
he looked at me and said, i've seen better days
i looked at him and said, there's a better way
three nails and a cross
equal forgiveness
just like you, i was lost
and that's hell to have to live with
i've sat on the front porch where you're sittin' now
i kept lookin' deep inside 'til i figured out
three nails and a cross equal forgiveness.
she was sittin' on her bed crying crocodiles
sixteen ain't a good age to be pregnant
and she thinks mom and dad won't love her anymore
like the boy who swore he always would but doesn't
she turns and sees that bible laying by her bed
and she crumbles to her knees as she bows her head
three nails and a cross
equal forgiveness
lord help me 'cause i'm lost
and that's hell to have to live with
i need you more than ever now, without a doubt
i've made a big mistake, can you help me out
three nails and a cross equal forgiveness

"we made it final today
i gave you all i had, you made your get away
all the love we once made
turned to memories today
i left the courtroom
and went straight to the church
i hit my knees and told god how much i hurt
there's nothing left of my heart
it's going to be so hard to make a new start
cause today my world slipped away
we buried the plans that we made
and tonight i'm alone and afraid
cause today my world slipped away
all my friends say i'll make it alright
i'll recover and start a new life

i gave her too much of too little too long
so tell me bottle are the things i hear true
that all the answers are in the bottle of you
i need your help this memory's so strong
i gave her too much of too little too long
sometimes a man can get lost in a world of his own
he'll neglect his real world who's waiting at home
a woman needs her man's love to lean on

"i was 5 years old the day
daddy started packing
and i stood there by my momma
as she cried
and the next thing that we knew
some old train came passing through
and daddy got on board
and we ain't seen him no more
chorus:
i wonder why trains make me lonesome
it happens everytime that engine moans some
and when i hear that whistle blow
well it makes my heart sink low
and i wonder why trains make me lonesome
it was a cold dark night
when i drove her to the depot
there were tears in my eyes
and a ticket in her hand
and as we stood there by those tracks
i knew she wasn't coming back
so i turned and walked away
but i still miss her today

central station
those ink spots look like
engine number nine
and this couch on which i lay
is supposed to haul my blues away

is like an old coal engine smoking"

most of the time.
i still raise a little cain with the boys.
honky tonk and pretty woman.
lord i'm still right there with them.
singing above the crowd and the noise.
sometimes i feel like jesse james,
still trying to make a name.
knowing nothings gonna change what i am.
i was a young troubadour,
when i rode in on a song.
and i'll be an old troubadour,
when i'm gone.
well, the truth about a mirror,
it's that a damn old mirrow.
don't really tell the whole truth,
it don't show what's deep inside.
oh read between the lines,
it's really no reflection of my youth.

chances of'em ever makin' it to forever

right as the rain fallin' from the sky

true, not another minute on this earth can be borrowed
so there's no way to know when i'll live my last tomorrow

"when i get off of work on friday, after working like a dog all week
i go to meet the boys for a cold one, at a little joint up the street
they got a jukebox in the corner, full of old country tunes
feed it five dollars worth of quarters, is the first thing i always do
'cause i need a little twang
a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
some peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train
to get that foot stompin' honkey tonkin' feeling going through my veins
i need a little twang, twang, twang
well, i like a lot of kinds of music
i try to keep an open mind
depending on the mood to strike me
if i'm gonna stay 'till closing time

enough to make you need to lie

where have i been all my life?
these days broccoli don't taste so bad,
& neither does swallowing my pride,
& i'm agreeing more & more with my old man,
where have i been all my life,'
some years are clear, & some a little blurry,
man how they fly by,
mom & dad sure got old in a hurry,
where have i been all my life,
being learning that forgiveness is as much for myself,
as it is for the other guy,
i read the good book these days,
& believin',
where have i been all my life,
some years are clear, & some a little blurry,
man how they fly by,

as if i didn't see that red chevy not slowing down
loaded down and rolling down our road
yeah, she's already left
so why can't i leave her alone
i wrote her letters signed i was a fool
she wrote me back saying go find a stool
and drink one
like you've always done
so that's what i did, 'cause that's what i do
backsliding, hiding away from the truth
'til tears run
oh, here comes one
repeat chorus
i've dropped by her mama's stoned out of my mind
just to hear that it's over from her one more time
as if i didn't see that red chevy not slowing down
or turning 'round, loaded down, heading out of town
or rolling down our road
she's already left
so why can't i leave her alone
i know i don't want her, i swear that's a fact
but the thoughtof somebody else rubbing her back
just kills me"
"you take it nice and easy
you play it safe 'cause that's what people do today
i guess that's ok
girl somewhere in your mind
there must be a perfect time to fall in love
but baby i'm burnin' up
so why not now, why not here
darlin' my heart just ain't too clear
oh what are we waitin' for
'cause i've never been so sure
why not you, why not me
livin' like we were meant to be
together, forever
why not now
right here in this moment
we could start a love to stand the test of time

no one knows tomorrow
the mornin' sun could rise and take our chance away
long gone with yesterday...........so
so why not now, why not here
darlin' my heart just ain't too clear

"seems you came along at the right time
fallin' in love is all my idea
others warned me about the broken hearts
you left behind
now why'd you have to go and prove em' right
now thanks to you
i know just how they feel
and because of you
my heart is broke in two
i'm feelin' like a fool
for puttin' my trust in you
you left me wonderin' why
you didn't even say goodbye
well excuse me if i'm now that smart
but why'd you go and break my heart
and because of you
my heart is broke in two
i'm feelin' like a fool
for puttin' my trust in you
you left me wonderin' why
you didn't even say goodbye

"sleigh bells ring are ya listin'
in the lane snow is glistnin'
a beautiful sight we're happy tonight
walkin' in a winter wonderland
gone away is the blue bird
here to stay is the new bird
he sings a love song as we go along
walkin' in a winger wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
and pretend that he is parson brown
he'll say are you married we'll say no man
but you can do the job when your in town
later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid
the plans that we've made"

reflectin' off the water
reflectin' off this bottle in my hand
when i get to the bottom of it
i got five more in that bucket
to get me free as can be like the breeze off the sugar sand
i was a shadow of myself
back on the mainland when you left
out here, i can clear my mind and the wind can fill my sails
one more tecate and i'll be
closer to where i need to be
six mexican beers between wish you were here and wish you well
you know these dark haired senoritas
they sure know how to treat ya
ain't sure what they're sayin' but i'm hangin' on every word
with every sip i get a little bit closer
to forgettin' and gettin' over
that memory that followed me down here to heaven on earth
i was a shadow of myself
back on the mainland when you left
out here, i can clear my mind and the wind can fill my sails
one more tecate and i'll be
closer to where i need to be
four mexican beers between wish you were here and wish you well
when i crossed the border, i told myself
i'd say goodbye in cozumel
two mexican beers between wish you were here and wish you well
yeah, i wish you well"
"you said she asked if you knew where she could get
some old boxes
cause she was going to pack up everything she owned
where the closest u haul place is
and what the cost was
this time tomorrow she'll be gone
she says she knows of a place to sell her ring
for a good price
that and what she saved will get her by
if she can find a job in that little town
that she's headed to
to start over with her life
chorus:
without me around
taking up her time and tying her down
without me in the way
she'll be free to enjoy the freedom
you say she's found without me around
said she didn't know what she was getting into
when we got married
but she knows damn well what she's getting out of

for a two week caribbean cruise
our first time apart
in ten years of marriage

the closer i read was right
this island is paradise
but not without you
she said without you hear
there's just no fun
in the sun would be had
without you here
it's no place to be
this dream vacation is a bad situation
i'm in misery
in a sea of tears
without you here
i said darlin' i'm sorry
i should of gone with you
had a feelin' you'd be feelin' this way
but i'm just as lonely

"well i was out a drinkin'
with a couple of friends of mine
when the bartender handed me the telephone
says ""there's a wife on the line.""
i told her i was just a drinkin'
with a couple of buddies i knew
she told me in a few short words
just a what she wanted me to do
she said ""oh won't you come home and talk to a stranger.
cause you might even make yourself a friend.""
she said ""won't you come home and talk to a stranger.
it's the only place in days you haven't been.""
well i sat there about an hour
talkin' with the rest of the guys
when she walked through that front door
she had ""get home"" in her eyes
she said ""you've danced and talked
with every woman in town but me.
and if you'd just come around the house
you might like my company.""
she said ""oh won't you come home and talk to a stranger.

"what kind of a world would it be for you without me?
would you think it a better world, or would you be lonely?
and if your love for me should die, would you even say
goodbye,
or would you just walk away into the dark of night?
chorus:
sometimes i need assurance of your love
for your soft and gentle touch
only kings are worthy of
and at these times you take me by the hand
like a child you lead me through a wonderland of love
life i can't visualize without you by my side
life would be meaningless, like a sun with no sky
though you show me everyday your love in every way
i'm afraid it's all a dream, that'll fade when i wake

wonderland of love"
"i didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked in
the only one to let these chills roll down my skin
my heart beats faster, i hear your name
i feel my confidence slippin' away
chorus:
thought i was doin' fine
'bout to get you off my mine
i see your face and then i'm
wrapped around your pretty little finger again
it feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
i see no good reason but still i'm tangled in your charms
my god, you're smilin' and you catch my eye
my heart is pounding deep inside

ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight
'cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright day light

thought everything was going alright

here's some final words from me
chorus:
baby, write this down, take a little note
to remind you in case you didn't know
tell yourself i love you and i don't want you to go
write this down
take my words an' read 'em everday
keep 'em close by don't you let 'em fade away
so you'll remember what i forgot to say
write this down
i'll sign it at the bottom of the page
i'll swear under oath
'cause every single word is true
and i think you need to know
so use it as a bookmark
stick it on your 'frigerator door
hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
where you'll see it for sure

you can find a chisel, i can find a stone
folks will be readin' these words, long after we're gone

"iâ€™d been workinâ€™ at forgettinâ€™ since you said goodbye,
lookinâ€™ for some good times, the best money can buy.

i never thought that iâ€™d be missinâ€™ you this way.
i shouldâ€™ve paid you more attention, but now itâ€™s too late.
you can buy a night out on the town, you can buy a loveboat cruise,

and said i want you to know
i've done everything that i know of
to make the feelin' grow
i've begged and i've pleaded with my heart
but there's no gettin' through
my heart's the only part of me

i'm done with fallin' apart
i' waitin' for my change of heart
i wake up alone
knowin' i'm on my own again
got it all straight in my head
must be somethin' i missed
as i went down the list
of the things that i need to forget
everything's gone
but you haven't left me yet
i painted our room
replaced all the curtains
and there's a new rug on the floor
called up the good will
said come and get it
everything she left behind is yours
i can still see you drivin' away
so why do i still see your face
when.........
i wake up alone
knowin' i'm on my own again
got it all straight in my head
must be somethin' i missed
as i went down the list
of the things that i need to forget

not a stitch of clothes
but there's still something here
and i don't believe in ghosts

you know me better than that
you know the me that gets lazy an fat
how moody i can be
all my insecurities
you've seen me lose all my charm
you know i was raised on a farm

but you know me better than that
i miss picnics and blue jeans and buckets of beer
now it's ballet and symphony hall
i'm in culture clean up to my ears
it's like wearn' a shoe that's too small

starin' at dresses and pickin' out rings

whats going on inside me i ain't used to going through

to mend my mind,and put me out of my misery

time is the ocean and life is a trip
you don't know where you're going
til you know where you're at
and if you can't read the stars
well you better have a map
a compass and a conscience
so you don't get lost at sea
around some lonely island, no one wants to be
from the beginning of creation, i think our maker had plan
for us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
and let the good light guide to the waves and the wind
to the beaches and a world where have never been
and we'll climb upon a mountain, y'all we'll let our voices ring
those who've never tried they'll be the first to sing

woah my my
i'll see you on the other side
if i make it
and it might be a long hard ride
but i'm gonna take it
sometimes it seems i don't have a prayer
let the weather take me anywhere
but i know i wanna go
where the streets are gold
cause you'll be there
oh my my
you don't bring nothing with you here
and you can't take nothing back
i ain't never seen a hearse, with a luggage rack
so i've torn my knees from praying
scarred my back from falling down
spent so much time flying high, til i'm face first in the ground
so if you're up there watching me, can you talk to god and say,
tell him i might need a hand to see a boat someday
repeat chorus
cause you'll be there
oh my my"

you're dancing this dance all wrong
new steps don't come easy when old memories hang on
i'm finding i'm falling as the music plays on
keep dancing this dance all wrong
a new partner's touch to an old partner's song
i'm getting the feeling as we dance along
two strangers tonight won't be strangers for long
keep dancing this dance all wrong
you're dancing this dance all wrong
new steps don't come easy when old memories hang on

when i'm high, i'm high because you love me,
