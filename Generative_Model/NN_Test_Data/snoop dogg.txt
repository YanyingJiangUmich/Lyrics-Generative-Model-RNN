you get your freedom
by letting your enemy know that
youll do anything to get your freedom
then youll get it
its the only way youll get it
when you get that kind of attitude
theyll label you as a crazy negro
or they just call you a crazy nicca
they dont say negro
or theyll call you an extremist
or a subversive
or a setatus
or a red or radical
but when you stay radical long enough
and get enough people to like you
youll get your freedom
so dont rum around here
tryin to make friends
with somebody whos deprivin'
you of your rights
their not your friends
no.. they ya enemys
and treat them like that
and fight them
and youll get your freedom
and after you get your freedom
your enemy will respect you, and will respect you
and i say that with no hate
cuz i dont have no hate in me

thinkin many plots blossoms how amny times?
i'm sedated my  from beginning
broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a n**** choke

wit' these silly ass b****es out for a n****s riches
now really really ever slip or trip
a big shout out to my n****s in ??
i spits the vocabulary to sinks mcs like ships
with my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips
i gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts
the homies catchin cases,robberies and assaults
it ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
listen in,get elevated off the verbal contact
brigde:when a n**** gotta strive for his he can't stop
gotta get somewhere
when a n**** gotta mash for his he can't stop
gotta get somewhere
verse 2:my mind state these days make the average n**** afraid
hurt em in the worst way,put it down for myself
put em to rest,confess nevertheless
snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best
for the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage
we drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
and the rest of the jungle,while mistreat
any mc tryin to f*** with d a z
i represent it to the fullest,it could be a verbal massacre
in '96,with a diff'rent approach i'm shit
i got the flavour and i'm major,bust the ass
n****s can't stop us and can't fade us
shady ass n****s can't stand next to ya
when the tek connects to ya,swift as a cheetah when i'm catchin ya
i bet'cha i won't let ya escape
face to real on point to train to kill beyond the violated area
when the smoke clears the area,rather we toast
so at home i blaze the zag or the bone
once again another zone is gone
mcs try to step they get lit and blown
at the end the lights go out so before they do
i'm a l b c on through,stayin true
demanding my respect,respect is what i've given
so respect is what i expect,the money got me driven
to the point of no return so the streets i roam
don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre glock,gat,gun or pistol
whistle and watch all my homeboys come run
or hear the click,damn that shit that you get hit with
when we bust i let loose,this is pre meditated d*** up
to all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it
with the every attempt they fail,oh well
consequences get suffered,i put pressure on sucker motherf***ers
the bill is crisp,the deal is this 
i gotta plot em on a mash for my chips
get in my way and get stepped on
i'm stompin,steppin with my projectile weapon
wuz up so's eject the hum
when i swarm through,who knew about the real deal i conceal?
but still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust
no ho is a must!if i bust
my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
we wax tracks and smack up mcs who compose the violence
bringin drama with no parental guidance
eyes went deceived,somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
and these mcs will be gs also d p gs and l b cs
when we do the do to you so go call your crew
and who wants to compete with technique
conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak

and if she follow.. then she gon' swallow
all the game you got to give her, be a different b**** tomorrow
but i would never bother breakin out tha doggfather

over you and me
sipping bailey's cream

trying to find relief
on the radio

when we first got together
early that september
i can't bear to listen
so i might as well drift
in the kitchen
pour another glass or two
and i try to forget you
late at night like a little child
wandering 'round alone
in my new friend's home
on my tippy toes
so that he won't know
i still cry baby
over you and me

1st verse:
now if you tired of the hard work
tears and sweat
and you breakin' your neck
and you still up in debt.
walkin' round town all strapped in,
n****s be havin' more bad times than captain rat did.
two strikes none left, out of breath
livin' in the city it's a jungle yo.
all this deception on top of stress,
you havin' more problems than a algebra test.
you can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent,
and now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent.
it's a thin line, between yours and mine
the difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime.
now i know a place where
ya' might wanna be and i can take you there
pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
you can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.
chorus
2nd verse:
oh your homies think you're funny?
doin' stick ups for moneys
just to impress the honeys got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,
you got two strikes, but you right back up to bat.
you all about yo' money and got something to sell
but if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell.
you chillin' wit yo' feet up
someone hated but baby without the homies and
that's when you got beat up.
because you can't be out there doin' low
and then right gather up yo' crew and roll.
ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt,
somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt.
but see, i know a place where
you might wanna be
and i can take you there
pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
you can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.
chorus
bridge one:
here ye, here ye, come one, come all.
to a place that be, call it lbc.
lemme holla to a little home boy real quick,

let doggyland be your new home.
verse three:
doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz owne

because a brother is a brother.

i kiss my sister and i punch my brother
i sit down on the bed to watch some t.v.

four young brothers got shot in the street
the very next day while i'm off to class
my momma go to work cold bustin' her ass
my sisters cute but shes got no gear
i got three pair of pants and with my brother i share
so there in school i made a fool
with one and a half pair of pants, you aint cool
cause there's no dollars for nothing else
i got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
now everyday i see my momma struggling
so now its time i got to do something
i look for work
i get dissed like a jerk
i do odd jobs
and come home like a slob
so here comes dogg his gold is shivery

or the other commercial i love
that's when they say this is you brain on drugs

now what the f*** made you think the dp divided
moving on up to the top of the map
because gangsta will be here till the curl comeback
i'm moving down to block d, me and my homies
the dogg pound would rock overseas, immense degrees
no b**** n****s in the circle
beat a n**** in his face till his f***in eyes turn purple
i told myself watch out for my family and health
i got my shit together, got the gauge up shelf
knowing the rules have chose to hang out with the dummies and fools
old school poda dada that i knew from way back to school
attitude shitty, kept it raw and gritty
uncut, me and my dawgs f***in it up

chorus

hook

knowing how we throw it out, the sucka n****s want to imitate us
cause all we wanna do is put the g right back in you
yeah worry about your muthaf***in punk ass crew
and we keeps it gangsta fool, thats gangsta, keep it gangsta fool
trip, we got more dough than rock up, more n****s to lock up
you n****s need to strap up or pack up
see because this world we live in is crazy, and the people they so sick
see why i keeps it gangsta and i ride with the sickest clique
and when it comes to gun play, hell yeah we the quickest biach
and oh my momma and my daddy, grandpapa and my granny
homeboy you can't f*** with this
smooth when we come through
the dp when we come through the gangstas is in the house
and all you muthaf***in n****s and you muthaf***in b****es
get a muthaf***in d*** in your mouth
i'm a gangsta i thought you knew, g'd up, grey and blue
dippin through on the coop, made you blue
kurupt and snoop, daz in the muthaf***in bomb ass clique

"don't do the crime if you can't do the time

fell off into a party in the cpt
n****s looking at me strange
but i'm up on the game
i ain't f***ing with them n****s no mo
shit, i feel the same way ya'll feel
n****, f*** death row i cut em loose, send em juice
with visine in their cup
catch em slipping, all my homeys get em stuck
it's the tale of a whale locked in a cell
on the streets he was the heat cause cuz had major mail
had his homeboys plugged, wearing gold chains
hanging at the studio, splurging and thangs
n**** f***ing off money, saving them hoes
f***ed off some money of mine
and bought me a white rolls
living on wilshire in a penthouse suite
f***ing bad b****es seven days a week
colder than a motherf***er but now i'm hot
floss me a brand new suit from dionne scott
i guess i'm balling now
money falling down
i can hear them movie star b****es calling me now
doggy dogg come and get with the pg
mr. calvin broadus could you please come and see me
but i ain't tripping, i'm just dogg pound cripping
talking big shit and in a bulletproof dipping
make my own beats, so f*** ya'll too
and i'm down with the n****s from the you know who
we get to the point
blaze the joint
step into the party and holla at everybody
as long as the gin get mixed with juice
and the five on the crap game gon hit with deuce
shit n****s gon be n****s so n**** n**** what
just because i'm having paper don't mean f***
i once was in the same predicament you was
thinking to myself ""damn should i kill cuz?""
but i know deep in my heart
two wrongs ain't right
and it started from a fist fight
i only got one life to live
i'm trying to see a grandfather with some grandkids
you dig?
i'm trying to live long like my hair
put the shit down, like fred estaire
i want to share my world
but how the f*** can i share it
everytime i throw you something
you look at mine and compare it
man, it's a cold shame
but it's a cold game
i ain't make the rules to this game
look, all i know and all i do
is try to come through with something new
banging for you
so whatever you do, you like it or not
because when your shit play out
i be back on the dope spot
my grandpappy once sat me in his lap and he said
""son get your money like that"" i sit alone in the zone
face of stone
live the live of al capone
a don corleone
casually casualties, fatalities
and all kind of funny looking n****s coming after me
funny, it's got me dodging, dipping, slipping, and sliding
eastside up, eastsiders cause we riding this is portable something to f*** with your ear
doggy dogg will appear to make it sound so clear

"intro:
verse one:yeah
vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack dead in your face
the street value of that is what you dream to make
run an illegal business,racketeerin
smugglin,doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin
bodyguards and hitmen like some al capone shit
heavy artillery got the cops on my d***
different locations,spots where it takes place
if you show them my money,your ass is gettin f laid
there's four major games that run the city of g's
the violators,the gambinos and the corleones and me
the violators and gambinos they run uptown
me and my cousin corleone we run downtown
murder's an everyday thang in the city
where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
tanadian nay,the charge of the weapons
hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
so we plan a plot with an uzi and 10 shot
buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
let em have it as soon as they come out
unload on their ass,commence to takin them out!
interlude:throughout the streets of long beach
the streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
they feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
from coming into our country, but they can't
the murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
now wanted by the irs and we will convict them of tax evasion
verse two:i had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down
n****s know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
i been around since the jumpstreet makin it pop
young crook keepin hook,n****,shakin the spot
had to be a standout not to get ran out
look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout
since the city long beach is only g's and hos
you hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
trust,bust,be aware and i ain't ya curse
cos the n****s that i dared to  the first
think i might be deceased 'fore i reach my calling
as long as i'm haulin my heat i'm stallin
i bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
where n****s get rewarded to grief for strikes
don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listenin
and war story glory ain't worth the riskin
real n****s still get a mob like respect
if you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck
who i be?i'm the dee,n**** check the file
under g you will see not to sweat my style
i'm takin em out!
interlude:
verse three:i come through blastin,me as a downtown assassin
mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets
shoot em down in front of hassans
should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
in my zone,don corleone wanted
for the murder of forty men
ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
from the u s c,i shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
multiplied by g's,87.3 million in a matter o'months
big business and big dollars is all that i want
i blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
toast till we all die,till we burst and break
from knives to guns,from the rich to the slums
we ran outta dope,i don't think so son
while i be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
from daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
from when i pick em off like darts
stab em in they hearts
make an example,what i said,ya end up dead
spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost doggs
never reach until i see the blue sky till i die
all i ever want is to be left alone
me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome
got paid by cops and judges,i budge when i buzz
i got the city of long beach goin crazy for drugs

i freaked one night, with this girl named pam
the very next day, i saw her with her man
one week passed, and i was in her again
i had an old tender, her name's jeanine
she was thirty eight and i was only seventeen
she likes to freak, she's just a fiend
it really didn't matter when i saw her in jeans
i want a big freak, fat and sloppy
i kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me
two tons of fun, big mad magenta
a country broad from alabama
i met this freak, her name was beth

i said, ""i don't pimp, or gigolo
i'm havin so much paper i don't need a hoe

i knew a d*** sucker named betty joe
i took her to my house and we did it on the flo'

with both sides ride causing plenty of tears
insane's and 20's both from the same city
a bunch of down n****s and it ain't that many
me, c, and the g can think back to the start
homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park
and having a heart
to get 'em up if it was beef
head up like g's, take it out in the street
hold ya own was the code that i growed to view
so i f***ed with and stuck with a chosen few

not to give you all of my time, that you wanted
you can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed

josey wales was known for robbin trains and things
layin' everybody down for diamond rings and chains
it remains the same in the year you live in, see
cos if i pull out some heat, n****, you'll go kick in
and that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
when it's time to duel, you get two men
two heaters, one street, one clock
and when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
if you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
but if you're too slow
i catch you on the downlow oh no, you mean the kid, shit's real
i ain't no john wayne, these n****s gangbang
the four horsemen, that's the click i'm wit
you mean the little bitty n****s with the itchy trigger fingers
yeah, we're on a mission ta kansas, slippin thru texas
we stopped at bonanza to get us some hot cakes
bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
the n****s in black, the fearless four horsemen
searchin for this location on the map
the gold rush, baby, got ta have it it feels just like it's 1865
and a trigger look a day is how i ride
on and on and on it's more strange
time to heat, shootin range
quick with the heat on their hip
young jesse james come to test your aim
i seen you at th e wild horny corral
i hearda ya name
tha forcify, n**** you ain't never lie
besides i'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
from coast to coast, n****s mash on every stage coach
my disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
the off the rocker roller coaster
on a six shooter holster
with dpg on every wanted poster
let me think about which bank to gank
which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
i want all the shit you got in stacks
attached to this skirt in the corner
so i snatched the b**** in the back
the dogg in me feels for the lust
but the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
back to the drawin down board
nowadays we drawn down more
to survive thru all the round wards
battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
i can't help it, i'm heartless, ya can't hack it
with my six shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
like that cock back
quick to pull my strap
just to put the horsemen on the map
born is doggystyle, individual, james got the hots
i got the six shots for all the plans and plots
i gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags
worthy workers for all the russian blabbermouths and gags
i got stacks so my stacks excell
hop in the coach wit my twelve clydesdales and bells
i'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
a 30 30 on my side to shoot a n**** o' course
it ain't no stoppin young josey
box all the nosey
headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
gold spurs on the gators, set back the clientele
oh well, for the recop i drop my bet
divide between my homies and ride the sunset
two sacks o' money from the train heist
they ain't even counted it up
just mounted it up
rode west toward the coaster, six shooters in the holster
pass thru a run down town whose walls hold my poster
closer i get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
so i gotta have what i can get
heard word about the gold rush and headed west
on my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
giddy up, the next town i rode thru
i had to threaten to blow their city up
undebts with chief black, caught five miles west
sell us some beads and hail us some weed
he offered me a toke
he didn't have a 20 he had they beads pipe smoke
i almost choked
break him for the get, right, i'm off into the sunset
tryin ta reach my destiny fast
it's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked i ain't makin no mo' stops
till i hit the spot, i made it twelve on the dot
i slid off my boots, counted my loot
five minutes after the strike of midnight
i counted 200 gs, i cocked my strap and slept tight
(at the gold rush, at the gold rush
at the gold rush, at the gold rush
at the, at the, at the)"

if i could play in the nba

i dribbled to the outside and passed it to shaq
they double teamed on him so he passed it back
look at the 3 but i don't take the shot
cause i think i'm cold and i aint trying to get hot
i'm feelin bionic, we playing the sonics
and i'm sticking gary payton so you know i'm ball hatin

hakeem olajuwon and scottie pippen, we shut 'em down
the twin towers, dave and duncan

we beat the bulls and we rocked the heat
and we traded for a few players, some pacers
miller and mullin and now they lakers
we cant be beat now, we on a 27 game win streak now, bow wow

two years ago a friend of mine

so i took the ball, and as i made the hoop
everybody jumped up and they said ""go snoop""
and my career jumped off into the fast lane
my rookie season i made my first all star game
double g like george gervin, thats what the call me cause i'm so ice
ballin cause that's my life, i balls all day, and i balls all night
they call me snoop dogg and everybody know i love to hustle and ball

i love to give you light snoop dogg as a child i was chosen
though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened
whatever the purpose, i surfaced above the fog
love was given to all, outside livin the ball
as an adolescent, one black child, i had a message
to reach teachin the masses, i wrote my first passage
it was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
i'm young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin
and dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of n****z around you
once you get on top they down you
but the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin
i found myself grindin on the streets quite often
with a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo' fifth coffin
at the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the eastside
where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the g ride
n****z throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs
never fo' a second did i think to let my light shine
hardheaded, thought i was grown, messin up
disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin
and then i found out that mom wasn't playin
today, i love you for it, back then, i couldn't understand
get my life right, step it up, n**** be a man
never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
through the stripes still gotta shine my light
i've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is big snoop boss dogg

you can’t imagine
it’s like living in the city of god
you feel me
imagine life on the yard
or trying to get that dollar
on some shitty ass job
imagine biggie with his son
or imagine pac getting called pop by one
imagine a mother struggling
dealing with a system
that don’t give a f***
about who shot her son
imagine life where you can’t win
when you get out the ghetto
and go right to the pen
when you get out the pen
you go right to the gin
so if get back to the streets
you go right back in
imagine russell still struggling
no def jam
just another n**** hustlin’
and ain’t no rocks on dem fellas
just rocks on them dealers
just trying to keep it bubblin
imagine n****s just stuck
from the east to the west coast
everybody’s f***ed up
i can’t imagine no less
but it don’t take imagination
to know n****s been blessed
with hip hop
snoop
imagine a world
where most black men die young
forced to gang bang
or sell dope and crack to the young
yeah, well that’s where we hail from
the slum
where most folks ain’t welcome
so you dog or you loc
smoke coke or you sell some
imagine growing up feeling country
imagine not understanding
why you got it the worst
now try to imagine my tears
imagine your people being in slavery
for a hundred years
and imagine you never knew it
imagine how bad since then
that you would have been going through it
imagine if rap wasn’t out yet
imagine having all this pain
built up, with no outlet
imagine how many lives would be ruined
if it wasn’t for hip hop
imagine what we’d all be doing
imagine me sitting on a porch or a stool
just bullshitting and never being called snoop
imagine if the government
was hoping for good
imagine if they never put
dope in the hood
i mean imagine if they let us
mold the youth
imagine if these mother f***ers
just told the truth
imagine if they wasn’t haters
imagine what would rap be
if we wasn’t the originators
now let your imagination run away
imagine life without hip hop

time to eat up off the streets full of fiends and hypes
checking cream off ecstasy to the green and white
dub sacks, the drugs packed up in kilo bricks
getcha slang on, bang on, and keep yo chips
baller had this, cause the savage beast did need to floss
so the hard, bogard, and we squeezed it soft
late night, the game tight, went up a notch or two
with fake vice, playin nice, steady watching you
impossible, the clock when you.. ain't overtiming
the vivrant ways for crimes on the grind and start shining
9 to 5 is midnight to sunrising
occupation gangsta committed to thug life
on a late night..
that's the time we gone ride
n****, it's do or die
late night
we ain't checking for names
when the hollow points fly
on a late night..

late night
deeper and deeper
they don't know who they f***ing wit
dead bodies with a funky smell
throw 'em in the ocean
jack the fo' up two times
and young n****, keep coastin'
turn on the dvd and watch myself on tv
it's killings after killings but they don't know it's me
it's lil' g, now what you think that stand fo?
i'm gangsta on the streets and i keep it crippin' in the studio
who else be up late night ready to jack like the whole house?
gallop in yo shit like the black joust
to make it real simple and quick
if i don't have it, i gots to take yo shit
and it's all about the fast lane, n****
when you see me on the streets, i got my finger on tha trigga
never catch who's slippin' when i'm on them 2 wing deez
and when i get my bricks, i flood ya whole city in titties
please believe, that i'm a lil' crazy motherf***er
turned out by the spillman's, gaithen's, and ruckas
on a late night..
that's the time that we gone move a gang away
late night
they call me chef boyardee, pushin' up some cakes
on a late night..
deeper and deeper
i bang these streets for all so long
late night
deeper and deeper
uh, wit this game that i got, i can't go wrong"
"my dawgs don't bark, but they get off
f*** around and get your whole face bit off
sinister, spit truth like a minister
so until i'm a monster, when it's the right time
night time, n**** tryna creep
and keep from dyin' in these motherf***in' streets

i'm not gon' tell y'all n****s what we gonna do
but whatever y'all did, put two on it
and put a foot on your neck with a shoe on it
resident evil, it's all on camera and they still don't believe you
clownin' around, don't come your clown ass 'round here n**** you gon' get down

when the nighttime falls, this the final call
this the final call, call, call
the final call, see reparations but we took it
for all of the shit you motherf***ers done did
now it ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun, ha

a lot of pennies fallin' out the air and on the stage
if my label's a book, you couldn't miss a page
but none of that really matter when i cut my eyes and roll
see 'em pass by, i nearly dropped my phone

she got me high, i don't wanna leave
i see her walk best, but she's something to see
and now i'm on the flame, feelin' so ashamed
i didn't catch her name, i call 'er miss everything
tell me, have ya seen her got something, pretty face and big brown eyes
smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle make the ground pile up i keep runnin' the tune at her
but the numbers neva have exchanged
everytime, every city, miss everything
miss everything
you know my story, i watched a lot of crowd
sold millions of records, i love my fans so loud
i got a thousand cars and all the perks of being
a real superstar, i live super far
but none of that really matters when i cut my eyes in spain
she walked in to me, like you did yo thang
and that spanish accent, the one i love so much
she look like an angel, one i wanted to touch
i blink my eye for a second and then she disappear
when i see that pretty woman, i felt like richard gere
ball on, ain't neva been one of that watch and pass
unless we in a room, and i leave and they watch that ass
but baby smth else, somehow i didn't speak
i been here so long, maybe i reached my peak
and now i'm in the plane, fellin' total shame
i didn't catch her name, i call 'er miss everything
tell me, have ya seen her got something, pretty face and big brown eyes
smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle make the ground pile up i keep runnin' the tune at her
but the numbers neva have exchanged
everytime, every city, miss everything
miss everything
yeah, you know my story, i seen a lot of hoes
a lot of gold diggers, luda' call 'em ""goes""
i don't call 'em back, and that's just how it goes
most people call me snoopy, or s to double o
but none of that really matters when i was in ny
i had a show at the guard, you know, up at corse
that's when i seen 'er, from the distance, she smile at now, everything i learned in the game told me she chose
and i don't miss a beat, this time i gotta speak
she look magnificent, like smth to eat
ergo, i can't let her go, i made my way through the crowd
lets get outta here, head off for lee child a lot of stars in place, doggy set the mood
i'm like ""i like yo style"", she's like ""i like yours too""
before i hit this plane, i gotta know yo name
she smiled as if she came, call me miss everything

they tell me that temptation....
ooh, is very hard to resist
you tell me that you want me....
i tried to hide my feelings, d o g's
ain't supposed to feel like this
you can call it what you want to....
but i don't even know what it is
you've got me singin' in the morning....
you bring me breakfast in my bed
and when it hurts you rub my head
i'll ask you one time only....
baby, won't you be there when it's hectic
when i don't have a hit record 
chorus
verse 2 :
i've traveled so many places....i've seen so many faces
there were times i didn't think i'd make it through i went through so many phases....that got me so many cases
three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do
i guess i'll call my lady....and tell her to kiss my baby
they tell me that crime is all i know how to do
tell him his daddy's sorry....let him know all about me
there's one more thing i'd really like for you to do

and the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
i'm mobbin' through the county mainline
back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine
spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days
as we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
i see no reason to cry but i miss my baby boo
and my n**** spanky too
it's true that the dirt i did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
and real g's gon cry
but i try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
and hope my baby boo ain't f***in n****s on the outside
but what's the chance it ain't crackin
if i was out and she was in i'd probably be mackin
i can't lie
so i say i would now my girl in a world of playahood
a playa should show a n**** love and look our

so keep away better yet stay away

its something kind of funny
how the man take your money
be sure as he can be
its such a way you'll never see
its a terrible thing inside
when your natural high has died
what we cant turn to dope
and put all aside the hope
chorus 
twinkling tinkling we do all sorts of things
while you're in a modest place
your conciouses only peace
yeah i had to make peace with myself you know what i mean

so i told myself i wanna know what it feels like to be high fo life
and i mean man i tell ya it feels real good

just being high for life is a different feeling

said if you'll come back n****, that'll be your ass

and found ridahman and he ran ?em for their lives
used his rida senses to go behind the mine
what kind of car they drive? so he what and there they go. see him pass a n**** black reeker
so he reached into his pocket and pulled out a desert eagle
rida start bussin', i think he hit somethin'
tommy falls out the car with his whole bullshit
and his homie didn't make it, ridahman got ?em all
even lonny gave the kid a chance to bust the tommy off
ridahman goes over to tommy and then he laughs
and he laughs ?bout the n**** but my gun start blastin'

it's 12.30 am, christmas eve
i'm out with the gangstas and thieves
celebratin', postin' up with eggnog  in my cup
 lil' bang bangin' and coastin'
down the block but be careful for the heart, because it's posted'
some stay to this day that christmas ain't nothing but another day
but, out of respect, i gotta give the lord his day
tell me, tell me, where do the homies and bums got to sleep? where do hungry and the needy greedy's got to eat? life is so crucial and cold,  for the children
in this world they hopes and dreams can't afford
the young and old churches and spiritual dreams, seasonal things
heard throughout the ghetto reaches gangstas and dope fiends, huh
'cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
â€˜cause the ghetto santa claus has sprinkled the hood and now we ballin'
livin' to a new year of better thangs
celebrate it with some champagne, ha ha, check it ...
chorus: nate dogg
santa claus ... is coming straight to the ghetto ...
bridge: snoop doggy dogg
now on the first day of christmas, my homeboy gave to me
a sack of the krazy glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
now on the second day of christmas, my homeboy gave to me
a fifth of hendog and told me to take my mind off that weed
now by the third day of christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
a whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nuthin' but game to me
verse 2: bad a$$
back then, you woke up to the sound of â€œi saw mama kissing santaâ€
made you remenisce on the old fashion christmas days
gifts, miss a fat man jolly with joy
down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
pumped up, i jumped up before the sun peeped in
and hoped to catch a santa claus creepin' down my hall
ran to the window, put my eyes to the sky
to see if i could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
i sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
my bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine till next year come
i try to see the same thing, they got us brain washed dumb
and when you find, it ain't no santa, christmas still mean a lot
'cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
you got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
when wishers give a toast by the tree, it's merry christmas

singin' my jingle, where is kris kringle
i didn't pop, i ain't even shouted
i even stayed in the house, where the homies tried to sneak me out
and all i want for christmas is my 6 4 chevrolet
and a granddaughter for her grandmother beverly
ain't that somethin'? nah, ain't that nothin'
how it's christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
everybody happy, hair still nappy
gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
catch me giving out turkeys at the church house
don't try to work me, just stand in the line and everything gon' be fine
holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
ain't no help from no elves, just tha dogg pound
and we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
christmas on the row, can you dig it? 
chorus
verse 4: tray deee
christmas eve, by the leaves, every 6 with the year
girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
to be ate after everything gone off your plate
but wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
on the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
i wonder what the morn's bringin' so it's hard to doze off
three 'o clock in my socks i crack the dope song
hopin' when i open the door i'll see santa
now who the hell is this in this blue bandana
messin' with the boxes that's up under the three
look like santa claus been crossed to a woman to me
now i'm comin' to see, the whole picture gettin' clearer
how we have messed; i says best get nearer
mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed i've be deceived
and thank the same trick for the gifts i receive
so i creep back, and act like i ain't even peeped it
this'll be me and mom's private secret
chorus till fade"

chorus "
"once upon a time, in the l.b.c.
on the eastside, off of 2 1 street
there lived a young man, cinderfella's his name
to make it interesting it's me, peep game
i lived in a house with my cruel step dad
and two step brothers who treated me bad
i cooked, i cleaned, i scrubbed the floors
and i was like an errand boy runnin to the stores
my brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""we've got fubu, and you've got rags!""
and even worse than that, to make me feel low
they gave me a skateboard, while they had low lows
girls used to say, ""snoop, you're so cute
but you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit""
welllll, one day, up the avenue
there was a man, surrounded by the dogg pound crew
he said ah, ""hear ye! hear ye! come one, come all!
the princess is having a royal ball
if you can rap, also dress fresh
you might win a date with the sweet princess""
well i, um, ran home when i heard the newsflash
i bust through the door, straight to my step dad
i said, ""step dad, may i?""
and before i could finish, ""hell no!"", he replied my brothers were goin, they were gettin down
even pops was goin for a piece of the crown they flaunted, they haunted, they knew what i wanted
""we can and you can't,"" is what they taunted they all stood there, laughin in my face
and as they walked out they said, ""clean up this place!""
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love
well i shrugged, i hissed, they all tried to diss
and i'd get them back if i had one wish
before i could make my thought a phrase
there appeared a man from a puff of haze
he said, ""what's up, dogg? my name is herb
i'm your fairy doggfather, you know it, word!
now i've came here with the main purpose
of granting you your fondest wish""
i said, ""herb, my man, just make me fresh
and i'm sure that i can handle, all the rest""
with a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
and i was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit
on my feet was some white tube socks
and a fresh pair of chucks from the foot lock
i showed him my sack, and don't you know
with a snap, the sack became some doe doe
once again his hands began to flow
then he changed my skateboard into a six fo' he checked me over, passed me the keys
and said, ""one more thing before you leave...
you must return before the stroke of twelve
or you'll turn back into your old self""
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love
i jumped in the low low and went on my way
i got to the party 'bout ten, i'd say
it was after eleven when i rocked the mic
and by the time i left the stage, the people were hyped the princess was starin, while holdin a drank
reflected from her eyes was gold tank
she waved her hands like, ""hello! hi!""
then gave another gesture like, ""come here, guy!""
i left the stage, girls came in flocks
the b**** was swingin from the hard knocks
i heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
gong! first bell before twelve o'clock
no time to waste, i broke out in haste
the princess followed in a futile chase
a quick steady pace is what i kept
lost one of my chucks on one of those steps
for the six fo' i continued my stride
about this time i heard gong five
i was down the block when i heard gong eight
and the princess screamed out, ""wait! wait! wait! wait!""
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love
i was almost home when my luck ran out
and there went my suit, my doe sack and clout
my fresh low low, also went too
and there was no denyin that my night was through
the one all star, the freshest thing i sported
jumped on my board, for home i skateboarded
made it to my pad, no time at all
went to my room, or better yet the far wall
hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased
then jumped in my cot to catch some z's
early the next mornin, when i awoke
i threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
slid into the front, my family stared at me
sayin, ""wasn't that you? nah, it couldn't be""
they kept askin me if i did my chores
my butt was saved by a knock at the door
""who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked
""the princess,"" this sweet voice remarked
she said she was lookin for a certain man
who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
the family ran around with their heads in the air
bringin her shoes from everywhere
she just shook her head, a nod of relief
and said, ""no, that's not the one that i'm lookin' for, chief""
i ran in the room and got my shoe
and said, ""is this the one you're referring to?""
well she said, ""yes, and you're so cute
but where's your doe doe and slick silk suit?""
i put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light
and i was wearin shit, from just last night
looked out the window, saw the six fo'
yelled to my family, ""i've got to go!""
we drove up the avenue, the princess and i
and in back of me, i heard my family cry...
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love
and i'm the rapper doggy dogg you love"

still,i stay close to the heat
and even when i was close to defeat, i rose to my
feet
my life is like a soundtrack i wrote to the beat
treat my rap like cali weed, i smoke til i sleep
wake up in the a.m., compose a beat
i bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
it's not a fluke, it's been tried, i'm the troop
it's ""turn out the lights"" from the world class
wreckin' cru

in the home of drivebys and ak matics
swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic

her violated the definition i was given; therefore i believe i
did not, do anything but testify truthfully on these matters.

but what none of them would believe though that i would be bigger the kurtis blow
i guess he was right, these are the breaks
despite my mistakes and aches, i'm gettin' cake
to realize your fate through faith,cause we all gonna get that day to see if our lives was straight

now as i think back to the words my granddaddy used to say
i never seen him church, but he always had the word
he would always tell me! sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad
you gotta do bad in order to do good"
"can you feel it, nothing can save ya
for this is the season of catching the vapors
since i got time, what i'm gonna do
tell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew
what you want on nate dogg
who sings on my records, 'never leave me alone'
'ain't no fun', now check it
back in the days before nate dogg would get it
he used to try to holler at this girl named pam
the type of female wit fly gucci gear
she wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair
when they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
talkin about baby please she wrought his service stress
since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
the homie nate dogg didn't appeal to her
but now he wear boots that match with his suits
and push a lexus coupe that's extra cheap
and now she stop flautin and won't it speakin
be comin round the pound every single weekend
to get his beeper number she be beggin please
dyin for the day to eat these
she caught the vapors
she caught the vapors
i got a little cousin that's kinda plain
he bring the heeb wit tha beep for the dogg pound gang
a mellow type of fellow best laid back
but back in the day he wasn't nuthin like that
i remember when he used to scrap every day
when my auntie would tell him he would never obey
he wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied
and a blue and grey cap that said the eastside
around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad
said daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
they said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta
or be there in jail or some other shaker
but now he's grown up to be a surprise
d a z got a hit record slangin world wide
now the same people that didn't like him as a child
bought the dogg food, doggfather, and doggystyle
they caught the vapors
they caught the vapors
i got another homie from tha l b c
known ta yall as d.j. warren g
he cut grass trasform wit finesse
......... and all that mess
i remember when we first started to rap
he tried to get this job at calvin's record shop
he was in it to win it, but the boss front and said
sorry warren g but there's no help wanted
now my homie warren still tried
on and on and on til the like break of dawn
to work at tha v i p would be the link
but they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
now for the year after regulate
warren g is havin papers so my homies write straight
he walked into the same record shop as before
and the boss be like warren welcome to my store
offerin him a job but nah he don't want it
damn it feels good to see people love warren
cause i remember when at first they wasn't
now guess what they call sessy bussin
the vapors
they caught vapors
i got to talk bout me now
last subject of tha story is about snoop dogg
i had to work for mine to show i was a true hog
when i was a teenager i tried to be down
and since they wasn't tryin to hear me i made the dogg pound
i saw a crew on 2 1 street
and said, 'can i be down champ?' they said
no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
after gettin rejected, i ain't runnin upset
i said, 'what's a dogg do to?' rhymes at rates
when i used to go to parties, they make me wait
what i have to get on the mic to set m c straight
i ain't never love no hoe since i'm listenin to my music

steadily rewindin' trying to make some hot shit
oh what a job this is
another all nighter tryin' to get it done
barely make it home with the morning sun
baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
oh what a job this is
drankin' yet i'm thinking of another rhyme
smokin' hoping that some bad news will come
some other time
cause i'm trying to do what i love, i love what i do
this music is something
mo' different than the weed and the brew
that's why we mashin'
we ain't asking for nothing we working for it
push it peddle it to the people they can't ignore it,
this is for all the independents, a few major labels
the big studios who still give n****s favors
on the mixin' and mastering, puzzlin'
and plastering the tracks together
on tapes, cds, wax or whatever
this is for all the engineers who smoke weed
can't forget about the production costs
and all the hidden fees
for another rhyme written,
we spend time spittin' in the booth
sometimes it's like a pigeon coop
but it's all for the cause  so i'm
gonna continue to mc and smoke weed, you know i'm
as easy as it looks to you i make it look so easy
with the music i be making the impression i be leaving
a lot of folks they stop and stare, thinking im'a trick it off
i roll another bleezy, puff it, pass it and shake it off
move on to the next phase and it's amazing
the next generation of rappers, big snoop dogg raising
mmm, that's 15 years in the game

i'm serving
my rhymes like nickels and dimes
plug it in, let it play and let me blow your mind
it's the dominant conglomerate prominent and i'ma get
what i gotta get, twist another sweet and bob to the beat
we work nights, we some vampires
n****s gather round the beat like a campfire
singin' folk songs, but not no kumbaya my lord
you download it for free, we get charged back for it
i know you're saying, they won't know they won't miss it
besides, i ain't a thief, they won't pay me a visit
so if i come to your job, take your corn on the cob
and take a couple kernels off it that would be alright with you

run my bath water, cook my meals
and shut the f*** up, when i book the deals
and iron my draws, give me cuffs and creases
it's your nephew come to f*** your nieces
gimme what i want
i got what you need
gimme what i want
yeah, yeah"
"got a little something for the summertime
while you on the grind
getting yours
hell yeah! i'm getting mine
i take trips and dips just to recline
i blaze up the orange weed
to relax my mind
spend time with my kids on the weekdays
and i holla at my momma and my
grandma on the threeway
she say, if you do right
baby boy i promise you live
a long life
i can't argue
i try hard to
not blast n****s
i walk past n****s
with my head up to the skedain**** tried to pull a fast one
on snoop dogg
to get some shut eye
what i do to him i can't speak
you know the episode
and the code on the street
i keep it all the scriffin' y'all
but real street for y'all
cause you never know
when you're gonna go, no
you never know where this road's gonna take you
got to be strong
you got to hold on
cause you never know, where
this life's gonna lead you
just hold on
you never know
>from the killing
the robbing
the squabbing
and jacking
car jacks to kidnaps
what? n****s be acting a fool
trying to set me up at the park
but i'm cool
act a fool
my daddy said throw them thangs
and stay strong
my momma got sick
so i'ma keep it strong
as long as i got my feet in the game
and make this beats
and bring heat to the game
f*** the fame
i got a little boy to see through
and him without me
is like me without you
keep it true
and stay down for your grips
homies and licks staying tight
like this
you never know
you n****s never know
which man are blasted for
never know which man to kill
just to settle the score
it wasn't long ago
i had this partner of mine
knew him just a short time
but he's stuck in my mind
my n**** lived perfect
said the streets wasn't worth it
if you don't die rich in the game
then what's the purpose for this struggle?
we stay piece to puzzle
invest half the wealth
and pray to god it double
we just in this
trying to get rich at the interest
keep it pimping
stay with n****s that's relentless
smoke dough
just because i say so
money pronto
and n****s never would know
they never know n****"
"  soopafly  
i had this b**** locked on to me like she was way too clever
man, soopafly never ever ever
fell for the do no and you know i'm
too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoez
it's too much for me to be givin' to you
uh, all i'm givin' is some d*** in you
now sh????, i told the b**** to blaze the weed
now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew
hey, i got knocked off on the bar
and my room got knocked off in the car
gave it to me until i reached my peak
baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week
i said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast
you've been givin' up too much damn cock and givin up too much ass
nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that
soopafly ain't even called the b**** back
ever since she tripped, i went on one
stepped in the club, caught me a homerun
baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call
i wanted to break that b**** like a law
picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof
then she said somethin bout the cost
man, that same bus stop is where
i dropped that b**** back the f*** off
you can't ride my bird
so i kicked that b**** to the curb
you best to believe
you ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me
you thought you had my grip
but soopafly never ever slips
you thought you had my cash
till i turned around and whupped yo' ass
....like a pimp and that's for real
  snoop dogg  
i came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute
tryin' to get my shoot on, so i'm a scoot on
over to the next b****, say her name is texas
she fly but she wasn't the sexiest
she had a hoe with her named bama, short for alabama
a big bad mama jamma, now look here
i like big b****es cause they large
and big b****es always take charge
wanna grab a skinny n**** like snoop dogg
cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll
now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
got alot of cash for a little love
all they wanna do is take you down to the mall
floss a little d*** and get a t shirt that say miss snoop dogg
i don't see a god damn thang
that's stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring
it'd look nice on my finger, i'm a buy you a zinger
cause you make me feel like a real hip hop singer
your homegirl, bring her cause i've been dying to meet her
you know i won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
she only get the d***, i'll never ever eat her
but i'll drop her ass cause you know i don't need her...
it was fun while it lasted
you know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby
you thought you had my grip
but snoop dogg never ever slips
you thought you had my cash
until i turned around and whupped your ass
....trick beyotch beyotch
  too $hort  
i said beyyyotch, what are you smokin
a big fat d*** comin' from east oakland
there must be some kind of misunderstanding
hit the parking lot, b**** i be standing by the benz
you think a n**** rich, b****
gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this d***
for all the wrong reasons
n****s ain't trippin' during pimp season
but you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
if any other n**** picked you up it'd be payday
i rolled to my house with the b****
 introduced her mouth to my d***
glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable
you f***in' with a dog, b**** you ain't fin' to come up, hoe
so you might as well enjoy the ride
and serve this n**** from the eastside
how much for the game that i'm sellin'
ain't no tellin' like jack told helen
i know sex sells but i'm a tell you though
couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable
f***ed all night woke up the next mornin'
told her i'm a pimp but the b**** kept on
wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent
it's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money
you thought you had my grip
but too $hort never ever slips
you thought you had my cash
until i turned around and whupped your ass
....trick beyotch beyotch
...i got family members, homeboys...
muthaf***az i look out way before you."
