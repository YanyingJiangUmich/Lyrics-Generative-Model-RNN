"it's been five months since  you went away
god send me an angel
god send me an angel from the heaven's above
send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
cause all i do is cry
god send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
see it's been five months since you went away
left without a word and nothing to say
want to wil' out want to up and leave
see it's all about you it's not about me
break me down from in and out
see i knew from the jump you had some doubts
should have known then you would never stay true
should have known then that i could never change you
now i'm on my knees and i'm begging god please
take away this pain that i'm feeling cause it's just too much
for me
and i try to open up my eyes i sure do try to see
but this man got my heart in a box and i can't even find the key
god please
god send me an angel from the heaven's above
send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
cause all i do is cry
god send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
come on that's right come on
no matter what i do it stays the same
told me i got to leave cause i wouldn't change
still i couldn't see i was stuck in the game
told me to leave my key or the locks gonna change
you want a new day one without me
but i'm stuck with this pain while she's yelling get out pre
what happens when your ride or die chick is living every night
with some good bye ish
inside i'm dying
just want to kiss your eye lids
help the pretty green eyes stop crying
one more chance take a trip to hawaii
she just looked at me and started sighing
i guess this is good bye still not realizing what it all means
still got the dreams that included you and me
got me on one knee willing to do anything to make it right
i'm trying to get doctor phil's number for advice
i never thought twice when i rolled the dice
never thought so many times you'd make me cry
deep down in my heart i used to believe that i was meant for you
and you was meant for me
but without trust there is no love
and i'm sure gonna miss them kisses and hugs
got to let go or i never will
can't wait for the nights where i can't stay still
love ain't for free got to pay the bills
say that you won't but i know that you will
deep in my heart i know you'll never change
and everything that you do i'll always be the blame
god send me an angel from the heaven's above
send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
cause all i do is cry
god send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
god send me an angel from the heaven's above
send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
cause all i do is cry
god send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
oh god...send me an angel
send me  an angel
send me an angel from the heavens above
send me an angel to heal my heart from being in love
oh god... send me an angel"

rule number one pick a target and study him for weeks
see where they rest at and lay with their peeps
now you got the drop, know their daily routine
so the 2nd rule please leave the crime scene clean
3rd rule pick a day, 4th rule pick a time
5th rule pick a fifth, 6th rule pick a nine
and the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet
so when the shootout you leave him 6 feet deep
8th rule meet in a fast car with disguise
use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
9th rule don't say shit cause po po listen
f*** around you end up being stuck in the system
and the 10th rule don't put a tag on a broken heart
just put a toe tag on your mark
and rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend
you better watch where you heading
i don't like you, you don't like me
its not likely that we'll ever be friends

my enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn to enemies

after n****z jumped me, bumpin my head
thinkin i wish i had a gun i fill a n**** with lead
took a kitchen knife to  fin' to poke me a n****
wishin i had a gun so i could smoke me a n****
sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
where bizzy had the bondeville and kev had the caddy
now those were the days, when crime really paid
the nine milli sprayed, i got the f*** out the way
from shootout to shootout, the bricks went fast
robberies went bad, n****z got blast
n****z kidnapped drew grandpa kid
came through and shot ms. leak in the head
you wonder why i got a gun? so i can get down for mine
you need that, out on the grind all the time
   repeat 2x
it was kangols, cazelli shades, pumas and corn braids
doo rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades
ski mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed
hoodrats to get laid, money to get made
yeahhh~! .. yeah i had a dream
i was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand
sayin damn! .. dope cost sixty a gram
i got to find me a n****, line me a n****
and say ""give it up kid, before i put one in your wig""
picture me thirsty, ridin 'round foamin out the mouth
sayin ""i don't get on, i'ma lay a n**** out""

i'll throw one back and leave blood on your shell toes

your p**** don't bring rainbows and pots of treasure
it's every girl's dream, to floss with the team
long limousine
dvd's on the screen
blowing on cream
waiting for you to scheme
you ain't gotta know how to read, to spray a magazine

when i use them big words, your b**** be feeling me
so ya'll n****s hate me, 'cause your wives be our groupies
ya'll irritate me, like loud people in the movies

or catch me on the dancefloor feeling some tits
sex sells, so i'mma p i m p

we was a school of sharks   a bunch of young soldiers
open your head when you're half dead – you see? i told you
on the island, got that burner, got the flamethrower
a couple n****s got blown, i got my name known
over the phones, soon as i'm home, the game's sewn

you think you want it, you don't want it with me homie
i'm dreamin' of…
my dream of freedom…
financial freedom
we stackin' paper ‘til we strong then we takin' over
grab a gat, bring the crack back with baking soda
bridge the gap, get slapped, actin' like you know us
north pole, nah, southside produce the colas
we're the last of our litter, this is what they taught us
we've got to kill what we eat, that n**** came up on us
if you ain't gamblin', get the f*** out the spot, boy
shoot an ace off your foot, that's some shit you should get shot for
f*** it, when i win i'm a winner – when i lose, i'm a winner
‘cause to my n****s y'all n****s lookin' like steak dinner
you screw your face the f*** up, you goin' through what?
the strap big enough in my truck to chew your crew up
n**** stand down or get manned down
mack, two clips, 30 rounds plus 30 rounds, flip it around
you gon' f*** around and get jammed up, blammed up
hit your spine, a standup n**** can't even stand up
i'm dreamin' of…
my dream of freedom…
financial freedom"

she wasn't feelin' me, i pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the
whip
uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
but on the sidewalk we ain't play games
we exchanged numbers and names
i went back to the range
i heard her girlfriend whisperin' ""i know that n****, he
rich""
she think i got six whips 'cause me and my man switch
anyway, her name is cece

either i'm trippin' off the ecstasy
or i could feel the world turnin'
i'm havin' flashbacks, i can feel the shells burnin'
comin' up, i was taught never back down
that's why i act the way i act now, hold the mac down
32 shots, squeeze til there ain't a shell left
come with my gun smokin', you can smell death
they get the first laugh, i get the last laugh homie
hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em
there's a lot of talk in the streets about me
n****z know, ain't nothing sweet about me
get back to questions, like ""50, who shot ya?...
you think it was preme, freeze or tah, tah?""
n****, street shit should stay in the street
so, keep it on the low
but everybody who's somebody already know
a few words for any n**** that get hit the f*** up
my advice if you get shot down, is get the f*** up
let's go
maaaaaaaaan
i told n****z not to f*** with me they still push me
figured they'd get away with it cause tone and poke p****
i been gone through static, shot at with automatics
since 90, when nas came out with ""illmatic""
if suge was home, death row would be good for me
cause tommy matola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
i've been shot 9 times my n**** that's why i walk funny
hit in the jaw once, why i talk funny
with a ruger on my hip, i walk the street with no care
think my grandma's prayers the only reason i'm here
my wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
that's why you b**** like me, so i'm a heavyweight
how dare these n****z take me lightly?
i ain't come to make friends and n****z aint gotta like me
my own homie said ""50, you done lost yo' mind""
cause i shootout in broad day, run and toss my nine
can't find a n**** in the hood, that say ""50 ain't hot""
when i drop, i'm sound like eminem and kid rock
play the block, with the watch all rocked the f*** up
jukes me, a week later y'all be shot the f*** up
born a healthy baby, i wasn't always crazy
this aint how moma rasied me, this how the hood made me
the d's call me by my government name
i be dumb and shoot up parks
have n****z runnin' like ""jesus comin'""
there's wet pillows in prison, n****z cry in the dark

yea, it would be like winning the lottery
it would be like you win mentally
i love you, i'm a little of new york hate
the anger that flows in our face
but today i am here to talk about love
when you're underneath i'll put it above
new 'curtis' city remains the same
games and gambling, crimes, g unit and fame
soldiers in the morning doing a love rap
swinging the arms in a maybach
we will make every minute claim like that
night that the stars tipped bright in my ear
don't be fear, i repeat not be fear
f 50 when with yay', not on anything
you can scream, oh hey 50 cent!
i love you, she loves all this man

yea fifty, if it's to talk about love
we can't leave the g unit out
up, down, i speak in distress
this story of crying for you ought to clean dishes
the next acquisition is my wishes
no n**** singing rap
it's not as if there was no star in the sky
flying in my private jet, knowing the sky
if the ask why, i say when i buy
the things i see in shop windows
in my power, when there is still time
i don't do the blind, my jewelry is the shine
look, the curves of cars, and the design
i'm the boss of this show stripper
don't mess with a n****
you can see who are the bigger
yea!
i love you, she loves all this man
this is our g unit game, this is something   for a real pimp'
i love you, she loves all that cake
i put everything to shake, look at my face   a real pimp'

it's not easy
life is not lottery
the life that i did was not by casualties
faced many wars
but i never knew the failure, i'm just a rap' star
winning more than a star of the nba
winning more than a star in la
this song will be the top yay '

detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me

where n ggas is outside right now with the rubber grips,

when you come from where im from, you come from the bottom,

so the feds got my phone tapped,
they treat me like fat cat,
and now im thinking man aint this a b tch,
from cola to cola, from moving the yola,
next thing you know, they up in your crib,
saying where is the stash at,
you move they gon blast that,
so i suggest you stand still kid,"
"if a b**** don't like me
somethin' wrong with the b**** why... oh why... why... you wanna f*** with me now?
yo dave, that shit come with the game baby, the money, you know
thats how the shit work, you know what i'm sayin'
they supposed to love me now baby
i'm doin' it now baby
hahahaha
girl, what makes you wanna f*** with me now?
i've been wantin' to f*** wit' you for quite a while
is the money makin' you wanna f*** with me?
the money gonna make you sell your soul
whoa... if money's gonna make me slam these hoes... then alright
whattup shorty, i ain't seen you in many moons
talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good i hope
you got a smile that only a fool would forget
and a figure that'll leave a n**** droolin' and shit
there i was, kickin' my game, pickin' her brain
buggin' 'cause a while back i met this b**** on the train
she wasn't feelin' me, i pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the
whip
uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
but on the sidewalk we ain't play games
we exchanged numbers and names
i went back to the range
i heard her girlfriend whisperin' ""i know that n****, he
rich""
she think i got six whips 'cause me and my man switch
anyway, her name is cece
she said she go to bmcc
push a '98 328 with chrome bb's
she said she seen me in the onyx video on tv
she liked my part the best, man, this b**** is tryin' to g me.
it's hard as hell to find a girl thats really down for ya
type that'll hold down the tre pound for ya
they into diamonds now, to hell with pearls
these trick n****s f***ed up, they done gave 'em the world
hey shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way i spit?
oh, i hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the d***?
nah for real, am i the type that you wanna roll wit'?
platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
i love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
that i could blow twenty thousand and think nothin' of it
know you wouldn't f*** with me if i had no ends
probably wouldn't f*** in the whip if it wasn't a benz
i guess life looks different through them shanel tints
man, i don't care if these hoes love me or not
long as i rhyme hot i'm gettin' head in my drop
it goes on and on and on and it don't stop.
one thing you can always count on is change
and a rich n**** to come put shit in the game
had a 4.0 then jigga made you trade your range
would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
while we on the 900 double r hondas
watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
while penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
all these hoes ain't madonna fans but all across the world
you can find a material girl
i sip dom 'till i earl
take 'em two at a time
quick i get in they mind
have 'em thinkin' they mine
bust off then tell 'em ""bust a uey, on mo' time""
i'm like the reason ya'll n****s can't eat this year
got your b**** breakin' her neck to peep this here
c'mon... uh huh... c'mon
f*** you b****! leave me alone, walk on... get the f*** on...
yo, shorty... tell your friends ya'll ain't f***in' with us...
aww man... look... he ain't mean that shit...
c'mon thats just records... n****s is playin'...
we wasn't serious and shit..."

should shoot the shepard in the head and da sheep ill scatter,
let n****s talk cause action is all that matters,
i asked about barnes he sucked his teeth and said he was soft,
said the boys up in otisville was breakin him off
can you picture him in the yard, n****s yokin him up
treatin him like a pin cushion, pokin him up
he came home actin like he hard as f***

n****s i cut, or we stuck, and they move, so we buck, they come back, in my dreams at night
i have nightmares, nightmares, all the time
last night i had a vision of my dead friends in my sleep, they showed my things, i aint really wanna see
they showed me flashbacks of murder scenes, bodies bubblin, in acid tubs, with they feet head and hands cut off, oh shit, i had woke up buggin, sweatin bullets, checkin for my gun, i gotta stop smoking that haze or something, i kno i aint crazy, i'll go outside for some fresh air maybe, it's 3 oclock in the night, the block is on fire, took my n**** bottle for a swig oh the fire, he told he just had seen the b**** ass n****, must be god that's keeping me from seein this n****, wanna crawl on me, and creep on me, cuz they kno better then to let me see him in front of me, outside the car, away from the police, i'll turn him into dreams, demons in my sleep
everytime i go to sleep it's like i stroll down memory lane and see the dirt i've done before, how i accuired the fame, if you can see what i see, you see me poppin the chain, or you see me scrappin, i pull out and pop off that thang, i'm usually hustlin, bubblin, slingin that 'caine, no matter the weather it's sun snow sleet or it's rain, see fiends got a habit, it hurts so they feedin they vein, and i gotta habbit of havin grahams of it mayne, i'm chasin the paper, it' simple i'm bout my bread, i cock it and pop it your white tee will turn red, see n****s that know me, who owe me, they see me, they run, they know if i catch em i cut em for feed em my gun, it's real in the field, n**** front and get yo cap peeled, with that nina, that check, that? on that mack meal, unload and reload, i live by the streets code, and pray to lord have mercy on my soul
keep havin these dreams, i think i'm just losin my brain, i wake up in sweat, my girl think i'm sniffin that 'caine, i try to remember, but none of them ever the same, i dream of my brother, but never since he passed away, he talk to me, and i can't hear nothing he say, f*** it, go along with it, just be happy to see him, i think that n**** tryna tell me something though, when i see him i forget to ask him, f*** i wanan know
probably tryna to tell me, your gun, it better blow, when you in the street, can't react slow, cuz n****s in this rap game, think shit sweet, getting disrespectful like i won't push meat, should be poppin off in my dream but then i get caught, is he tryin to tell me so my soldiers cuz you a bust, n****s wanna see my down, i aint 'fraid of getting poked, damn if i ever go broke"

so the only thing left now is tools for these cowrads
i got no friends, f*** most of these cowards
they pop shit 'till we start approaching these cowards
while we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers
i got a intergangstress who argue and steams wit reefer
and who flip when i call a b**** like she queen latifah
not all the vehicle's is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
this shit can get uglier than the master p sneaker
we slidin through the ruckus, wit prada on the chuckus
soon as spring break ho's home from college wanna f*** us
i ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckas
i'll sick rottweiler's on you f***as, cops followin to cuff us

and leave wit 12 shells in ya mouth like a carton of eggs
i'm the young pimp pardon my age

n****s find what club they at
take 'em wit us, and run a train on 'em like a subway mac
get advances from grey agra
see these record labels got most artists gettin f***ed like the g** rappa'
i go the college on the tour
i'm goin down in history n****, next to wallace and shakur
i keep ya ammo clean, text polished in the drawer
camera's by the hamper that mine into the floor
by now, you probably heard of me
fresh outta surgery, flashy as a f***, you gon' have to murder me
burglary, i'm leavin wit cha nike's bergendy, white t, bergendy

n****s love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
catch me on the boat wit weed smoke and official gear

besly in the robe, re motes for liftin chairs
you ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya

i told my lawyer, ""i ain't heard of homey""

you see i'm on your crib, it ain't a burglary homey
they fin' to have me stuck in purgatory
i'm down to do the stickin’ when it come to the orgy
conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
wait~! i'm getting’ sidetracked, back to the story
these cocksuckin’ police got it in fo' me
they flash the lights, they wanna rough me up
frisk me, find my burner, and cuff me up
but history repeats itself, they never learn
the unit's the new bebo, who gon' be eddie byrne? we'll find out when n****s let off the rounds
and his partner's screamin', ""officer down!""
police get in the way, i'll murder them
i'll murder them
a n**** already got three strikes, i'll murder them
i said i'll murder them
any motherf**ker touch me, i'll murder them
i'll murder them
you don't believe me, wait and see, i'll murder them
you see i told you i'd murder them
they sayin’ i'm an accident waitin’ to happen
i got one in the head; i'm just waitin’ to clap it
a pimp told me i was made for this mack shit
so just get you a white girl, don't f**k with no black b****
i got two felonies; from sellin’ that crack shit
and the third one, came from showin’ n****s my mac spit
see i'm down for that daytime action
have n****s crawlin’ under cars when i start to cappin'
so they don't know what to say to the captain
but they know if word get back, somethin gon' happen
i've been shot, i've been stabbed, but i ain't been snitched on
when you snitchin’ where i'm from, you gon' get your shit blown
i make the best of the worst
we gotta share the same b****, okay i go first
cause your baby's momma is, my baby's momma
i come through to see my little n**** with the llama
police get in the way, i'll murder them
i'll murder them
a n**** already got three strikes, i'll murder them
i said i'll murder them
any motherf**ker touch me, i'll murder them
i'll murder them
you don't believe me, wait and see, i'll murder them

a can of whoop ass with a shady aftermath lid
you pop off the top, its like open and vats of acid
beat the octomom to death with a cabbage a patch kid
attack her snatch, yea theres something to jack a batch in
impregnate her, then shoot up the embrio sack with mac tens
triplets, quadroplets and a couple of back to back twins
that fetus is falling out all over, jack is back again
the ripper’s at your service, girl i can see that you’re nervous

its past your curfew and its dark
im searching for you in the park
shady murdered, yet another virgin
he just hid his mark
he met his quota for the month
they found dakota all rolled up,
inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
disappeared without a trace, no dna, no not a drop
cuz me and dre and 50, we wont never get caught by the cops
seeing how they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter top
you see im a psycho, a sicko, im crazy
i see i got my knife pull’d, i’ll kill you, dont make me
they wanna see me, shot up, locked up, and cage me
i come back bigger, stronger, and angry

and you’re goin to find out what the f*** we’re like with pliers
its operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
squeezin, he bleedin, he weezin breathin, he half dead
he musnt know, but know he know, how shady aftermath is
even murderous tactics, get better with practice
lead showers, gun powder

jewel of arts, juliard, you better, learn learn
chris reeves, in his grave, ya homie, turn turn
im the debating, utilating the lady
you been waiting for shady and fifth
aint no duplicating it baby
there’s a baby in the dryer, there’s a torso in the washer
i think it might even belong to porsha when i tossed her
arms and legs in the garabge cuz the rest of her i lost her
her head is in the disposal with jessica’s, i squashed her
and put her through the ringer and hung her over the wash tub
when im through with ricky, it’ll be blood that’ll cough up
a hard rock, or softer, get caught up, and get washed up
in detroit im awful
when is this ship is nauseous
look deep in my eyes
see, many many many men die
i swing gym stars faster than samuri
you see im a psycho, a sicko, im crazy
i see i got my knife pull’d, i’ll kill you, dont make me
they wanna see me, shot up, locked up, and cage me
i come back bigger, stronger, and angry

had your favorite actress from your favorite shows
in my favorite position, you know how it goes
in my bentley bumpin' prince shit ""this is when thugs cry""
this is what it sounds like when hollow tip slugs fly
homie, this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to
stay on point, cause *****s will ride and smoke you
jealousy's for women, but some *****s is b**** made
they make you wanna run across they're head with a switch blade
they point their finger at me, sayin' i'm bug
my flows crack you listen, your f***in' brains on drugs
look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on the tec
fool trippin' through the set, you can get ya ass whipped
cards missin' out my deck, screws loose show respect

this is what you call ryder music
all the gangstas are ridin' to it
let's roll, i can show ya how we do it
when we ride to that ryder music 
my mama gave birth to a winner, i gotta win
pray to lord, forgive me for my sins

i'm fallin', in love with success
entrepeneure, kinda sewer, i maneuver the best
rowin', ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
stunt i'll have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle
as wise men speak, i listen and learn
a man dies, a baby's born, my *****s the world turns
rappers, i make 'em sick when i say i'm the shit
they mistake my confidance for arrogance, they hate on the kid
in '99, i had a vision and made a decision
bein' broke is against my religion, now picked up
this is what you call ryder music
all the gangstas are ridin' to it
let's roll, i can show ya how we do it
when we ride to that ryder music "

"spend some time   eminem , obie trice, stat quo & 50cent 
 if there's any b****es in this room, then there's something i gotta say
for all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
i've been down that road and now i'm back, sittin' on square one
tryna pick myself up where i started from
i never woulda thought that i'd see you outta control
even though my penis was deep down in your hole
you should know between us we was like mates to soul
nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
you was more or so the chalant type, i chose
to more shows, haunted you nights i suppose
that's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows
in the beginning, friends we decided to roll
so who's responsible when you get excited, explode
and obie's grinning, then you invite that obie's cold
but b****es the gon' talk, n****s they gon' hate
we established this way before we became mates
so whats required is that you chill with all that fire
get your desire when i retire
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right cuz you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
 i used to say i never met a girl like you before
still ain't got a f***in' clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
can't believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
if you recall i used to treat you as a groupie broad
when we f***ed i refused to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
you started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
and the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
and who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
cupid could shoot another one of them god damn darts at me
it's true that i got shot in the heart
but when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
but see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
before you make a decision that's life altering
and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
in most cases, stat's attitude is f*** a b****
my only motive is to get head and f*** a b****
but you was different, thought we shared a covenant
even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick
i'll admit, i was caught in the mix, down to commit
feed you the best of me, i shoulda fed you piss
we started off closer than close
but who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth
and the final result, back in that same boat
i ask myself, do i love these hoes? no!
em introduced us, ""50 this is tanya, tanya this is 50""
then slid off and left her to kick it with me
i complimented her, i said you have very nice lips
with my imagination, i could see her suckin' my d***
we played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
downtown manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
penthouse full of imported shit, you know how i grind
she got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
why talk when suckin' my d*** is the real career move?
said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
yeah, yeah, know how many times i done heard that shit?"
"they say they do it, like i do it with no mask on
n****, get the f ck outta line, you getting blast on
jesus let the weak roam the earth without a purpose.
i?ll stomp ya f cking head til it?s under the surface
now i need you to get it through ya bloodclot head
?fore i put a bullet through ya bloodclot dreads
these n****s ain't made of the same shit i?m made of
i double click for my man if he needs a favour
i let a n**** slide he came back and almost shot me
and he was thinking i was scared, nah n**** not me
you don?t understand i was raised by the vultures
still laughing like hyenas in the crib full of roaches
call grandmami mommy cause mommy already dead
daddy been missin? since i was a little kid
now who dared go there playin? games with the orphan
they know my pedigree test me i?mma off ?em

don?t cry, dry ya eyes
don?t cry, dry ya eyes
that first body drop, we just getting started,

ar15, m16, semi automatic, murder machine
wave that, blaze that, give a n**** wings
when that blade enter flesh it?s an emergency
ya love leak, heart open call the surgery
feels like my last girlfriend i lost her
on second thought i know just where i left her, the alter
see, i?m at an advantage i don?t care about tomorrow
find out that i ain't frontin? when then patience start to fall
you know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds know, now i?m half crazy
what is that a tear i see forming in ya eye
why are you so frightened we?re all gonna die
you can say a prayer when i?m coming like the reaper
staring through that sight on the top of my heater"

some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
some get it in the foot, bleed all over their airmax

she was looking at me sideways like imma thief or something,
that hurt me, come on son that wouldn’t hurt you,
i pistol whip that n gga til his face was purple,
i need anger management, see i hold onto a gun,
the same way i hold onto that nickle placed snub,

b****es be frustrated with the baller
qonder why i call her
maybe because i'm busy and she needs someone to spall her
hickups annoy ya from time to time i gotta ignore her
in order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
she loves it when i'm in town
hate it when i'm not around

next door neighboors hear the sound
pictures hittin' the ground
just enough to hold us down
i'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round

i admit i fell in love with a frame
and to make her feel special i let her call me by my government
name

surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only

watching her lick her lips
or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips  man

we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
and wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
and let it go to whoever's holdin' the most current people on their shoulders
and their soldiers got their backs till it's over
