she built a castle from the piece she took from me
i'm going crazy, think she brought out the worst in me

guess the price was the fall if i get up
cause the strong will survive, that don't give up
where she fell in love, her heart is resting now
six feet underground
ooh she feels stupid loving me for me and i'm the fool who falls too easily
we all fall down sometimes
we all fall down sometimes
so why can't i? so why can't i?
you gotta go i know the time waits for no man
don't say your words unspoken girl i overstand
here i am

if you believe please except my apology i didn't mean to hurt you girl
i didn't see myself settle down

from the moment i looked into your eyes
i never want to see you cry over me
but i knew if we got serious in love
we would never ever wanna break it up
i wasn't ready for you until this day
could you believe when i say that

what would you do in the middle of the winter
when the sun goes down and it gets cold?
growin' up in a house with no stove
no doors, no walls, no windows
and my brother was always fresher
i would go to school in his clothes, when i did go
so that's why now this the type of life that i live for
comin' up as a youngin', man some nights i would vomit
i would throw up on myself cause i was so sick to my stomach

my nightlife's like a soap opera
with two chicks like i'm noah's ark
they got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like ""oh god!""
from a poor child to on top like a mohawk
but i always new i'd go far
like a gas truck with no bar

"never thought it'd catch me
never thought it'd cost me
never thought it'd hurt me
never thought i'd fall in love..
but i did
i feel like somebody dropped a ton of bricks on my stomach i can't eat
i can't sleep
and it hurts me so deep
i heard people talk about it
and laugh like it'll never happened to me
now look at me
it caught me
see how quick karma comes around
who says a man ain't supposed to cry?
wish i can crawl under a rock somewhere and just die
just want the pain to go away, today
i don't wanna cry no more
and i don't wanna hurt no more
and i don't wanna love no more
especially if it causes this
i don't want no part of it
because it hurts me so bad
even when it's sunny outside
it still feels like it's raining
no clouds inside
but i still need your umbrellasometimes i wish i would've never let you in
and then, wish i never met you
fell in love with you
then i wouldn't feel like i do
who says a man is supposed to cry?
wish i could crawl under a rock somewhere and just die
just want the pain to go away, today
i don't wanna cry no more
and i don't wanna hurt no more
and i don't wanna love no more
especially if it causes this
i don't want no part of it
because it hurts me so bad
never thought it'd catch me
never thought it'd cost me
never thought it'd hurt me
never thought i'd fall in love
but i did
never thought it'd catch me
never thought it'd cost me
never thought it'd hurt me, like this
i just want the pain to go away, today
i don't wanna cry no more
and i don't wanna hurt no more
and i don't wanna love no more
especially if it causes this
i don't want no part of it
because it hurts me so bad
never thought it'd catch me
never thought it cost me
never thought it hurt me
never thought i'd fall in love
but i did
never thought it'd catch me
never thought it'd cost me
never thought it'd hurt me like this

"yesterday i fell in love
today feels like my funeral
i just got hit by a bus
shouldn’ve been so beautiful
don’t know why i gave my heart
gave my trust, gave everything
you think that if i had the chance
to do it over again
i’d do something different
make better decisions
save me from my ignorance
but i keep
making these same mistakes before i
i see the danger but i go forward
i’m sitting here trying to keep my composure
knowing inside i’m broken and tore up
she got me gone i’m on her like a truck
i try to go but end up wanting more
stuck in my head baby there’s a picture
imma be clean but i can’t get rid of her
uh give my all you take it from me
and don’t even replace it for me
i wish you just fake it for me
i wish i can make you love me more
you can’t tell i f***s wit you i needed you
i thought that you understood that based on how i treated you
i don’t pay attention to the rumors that you feed into
know you’re missing something i wish i was worth ??
she’s like a drug
and i don’t think i can get rid of her
cuz she got me in this curse
and it dawned on me
i can’t do nothing with her
this woman’s worth
can’t find my way out
and it hurts
ad i’m trying but she won’t let me go
oh,oh,oh,oh,oh she won’t let me go
oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
i feel like a killer hit me
the weapon was concealed initially
but i felt so much pain from it
you deserved to feel it with me more
i feel like i beg wit you i plead wit you
i don’t comprehend when you can’t love when its so easy to
i thought you could do it i believed in the naïve in you
i just need to breathe baby now i got the freedom to
damn…
yesterday i fell in love
today feels like my funeral
i just got hit by a bus
shouldn’ve been so beautiful
don’t know why i gave my heart
gave my trust, gave everything

"they say pain is growth, i hear you
i just wanna make it stop, all this hurt, f***
waking up to my high, empty place messages in my phone, telling me that you're gone
didn't even give me one chance to explain i guess it didn't matter at all, matter at all
she was just one night, she was just one night
baby, you were my whole life, you were my whole life
wish i could go back then and undo what i've done
that would be impossible, oh yeah
but if you could see what my eyes can see you would see what you mean to me if you could feel the way my heart is beating
you can feel my energy
you keep coming back for me, you can feel my energy
i wouldn't be the enemy
i don't wanna be the enemy
i cannot undo what i have done i know you don't understand
how i couldn't resist it especially since i knew you were the one, girl
i knew you were the one
should have been the only one
she was just one night, she was just one night
baby, you were my whole life, you were my whole life
wish i could go back then and undo what i've done
that would be impossible, oh yeah 
but if you could see what my eyes can see
you would see what you mean to me if you could feel the way my heart is beating
you can feel my energy
you keep coming back for me
you can feel my energy 
i guess this is the end of me 'cause this where we fall apart but if i fix these broken pieces of your bleeding heart for us to be the enemy
'cause i don't wanna be your enemy
do you remember when we fell in love? 
she was just one night, she was just one night
and you were my whole life, you were my whole life
but if you could see what my eyes can see you would see what you mean to me if you could feel the way my heart is beating

"you don't see me
the same no more
it's hard
to see the light
through closing doors
don't treat me like
like i'm invisible
you talk with me
it's not the usual
we scream, we fight
saying things
that we both regret
and that's not right
that you could
just forget me
like that
you've never tried
always taking
the easy route
always taking
the easy route
never wanting
to work it out
you want to be free
you want to leave me
i can't believe
'cause without you
baby
i'm incomplete
chorus:
am i erased
just a segment
of your imagination
i'm feeling replaced
like a faded picture
where you
can't see my face
scratched out
erased
in memory
of what we used
to call love
i reminicise
what used to be us
remember when
when i was
the most important
to you
but now i'm a ghost
the trust has died
there's no way
we can bring it back
we live a lie
no bars
no strings attached
is this alright?
a part of me
just wants you back
can anybody see me
see me now?
i'm erased
from the crowd
so cold
and i don't know how
to find me
chorus"
"ooh, yeah
do you remember the time when we fell in love?
'cause i remember the night
when you had enough of my creeping, oh
you packed up your bags and said you were leaving
you found a new man and said we were even now
even now
it's funny how everything seems to even out
even now
i wish you could put it behind you
wish you would put up your blinders
wish you would stop listening to you friends
and come to where no one would find us
wish you would just keep your focus on me
so i can give you a reminder
that i can be who i'm supposed to
i can do better, i know you remember
every single night, we were living life in love
every single time, i was doing right, enough
to keep you around, now look at where i end up
look where i end up
remember the time when we fell in love?
'cause i remember the night
i know you had enough of my creeping, oh
baby, it was only for a season, maybe
and it ain't really had nothing to do with you
it was all really me 'cause i was tryna see the world like a dog on a leash
and you was tryna hold me back
i ain't wanna let you go ahead of me i let you go and i knew i should have never
let you go ahead of it
you remember every single night, we were living life in love
every single time, i was doing right, enough
to keep you around, now look at where i end up
look where i end up
remember the time when we fell in love?
'cause i remember the night
i know you had enough of my creeping
baby, it was only for a season, maybe
keep going round, round in circles
hoping you understand my circumstance
lord knows i never meant to hurt you
is it because i'm a dog now?
wish i knew then what i know now
i'm not the same when i go out
i just keep it on the low now
is it because i'm a dog now?
i'm not the same when i go out
wish i knew then what i know now
i just keep it on the low now
don't you remember the time when we fell in love?
'cause i remember the night
i know you had enough of my creeping
baby, it was only for a season, maybe
keep going round, round in circles

"i'm only human dawg
i'm only human dawg
i'm only human dawg
can you forgive me
it's an sos to let me be me
ay, ay, ay listen to me
and when they push you down,
you got to get back up
and when they push you down,
you got to get back up
push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
cause when you got the belt and the ring
people with ya poppin bottles, taking pictures look around
as soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement
surprise, i'm here to show that i'ma rise above this
ay, what it is world
yeah it's me again, back before you, at your mercy
don't bend your knee again, no running from the truth
as much as we pretend, that it aint what it is, than it hits cnn
apologies to my fans and my closest friends, for letting you down, i wont take you down this road again
most of you now saying whatever, here we go again
blogs, radio, and television all going in
i laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrasment
i gotta say you f cking haters is hilarious
how dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou
point your finger now with me looking down
same clown that was twitpic'ing at my wedding
on the same twitter page disrespecting
wait a second never mind my imperfections this is fact, remember that
no mistakes too great to recover and bounce back
and when they push you down, you got to get back up
and when they push you down, you got to get back up
push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
cause when you got the belt and the ring
people with ya poppin bottles, taking pictures look around
as soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement
surprise, i'm here to show that i'ma rise above this
i admit, yeah, i done some dumb sh t,
disappointed everybody i know
try not to hold that against me though
my road to redemption has no gps
so guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested
yes it's hard living life in the spotlight
trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
the bible say ""let he without sin cast the stone first"" the sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair
he just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead
difference is, my shortcomings hit the media
thanks to tmz, the ajc and wikipedia
see the stairway to heaven while stepping down jacob's ladder
my good outweigh the bad, god, aint that what really matters, nope
a matter of fact i'm wrong but after that the good i've done in your hood
should it overshadow that?
got the world laughing at me for the moment
but it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with
even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence
the people with you then but when they turn on you remember this
chorus
push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup
or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
cause when you got the belt and the ring
people with ya poppin bottles, taking pictures look around
as soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement
surprise, i'm here to show that i'ma rise above this
hello, out there
can you hear me
can you hear me
ah, ah, ah, ah
can you hello, out there,
can you hear me
you gotta get you
you gotta gotta believe in me
hey
i accept full responsibility for the all the wrong i've done
if y'all thought i were perfect
i apologize for being human man
but never again partner
you can put my life on that
and you can love me, or you can leave me
before you judge me, just let me be me
and you can love me or either leave me
before you judge me, see life ain't easy"

check this out girl
i know you sitting back saying to yourself
""i know he ain't trying to holla!""
naw
but there's something i got to tell you
oh yeah, oh yeah
you ain't got to do it though
and i just want you to sit back and listen
while i sing this song to you
check me
listen
it's not the hardest thing for me to say
without cracking a smile
it's something that we both really feel inside
but never talked about
they call in love
oh yes they do
a dangerous thing, when you're part of the game
so girl i feel you when you get emotional
and don't want to let me go
but there's something i got to tell you
i don't mean to cut you off but the question is:
so when you gone be my girl? (when you gone be my
girl?)
i want to know
when it comes to loving,  you change the subject
and girl you know that i'm the man oh yes i am
girl what's really good with you?
 when you gone be my
girl
all this breaking up, is getting old now
so baby tell me where i stand
i know
you probably saying to yourself this brotha tripping
but
this stuff is real
but ain't true men that felt love will have the nerve
to step up
and tell that baby what's up
to let her know he's really impressed
now getting straight to the bottom line
you're the type of kind of girl a gangsta needs by
his

"it's been a struggle for me,
wonderin` why i can't get by with my life,
but now i'm free,
and i done did some right and wrong,
but still i see the light,
and i done been around the sex and drugs,
hustlin` but mama ain't raise no thug,
and it took a little to see how real it could get,
and how this life wasn't meant for me 'cause i,
seen a lot of bad things on my block,
but i ain't wonna be a victim of a gunshot,
i can't let nothing? hold me down
see all the things i read about,
aee all the things i've heard about,
i seen the light
it's kinda hard for me,
to stay away from all these girls
and the haters they don't like,
that i'm fulfillin` my dream,
but i'm just tryna do my thing,
my n**** can't i live my life,
i got the world on my shoulders ,
and i'm only getting` older ,
but it's like it's getting` colder,
i'm gone make it but i can't take it sometimes,
i came a long way from my block,
and i'm grateful for everything i got,
i didn't let nothing bring me down
aw man, after all this, who would`ve thought,
little boy from tappahannock, virginia,
you know what i`m sayin`,
would make it all the way to the top.
life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit,
they try to show us the light but we don't like to
hear it,
mama told me i was bright but despite her lyrics,
a large heard across my sight i had to fight to clear it,
like a runner a couple of summers i often wondered if it really was winter
and that's when i heard the thunder,
a current was occurin` it was stirrin` up my hunger,
but i couldn't let the shit bury a n**** under,
use to cry hopin` all of this would pass,
and then i learned to use my tears to water up the
grass,
a part of my swagga but apparently i won,
i took my shades off and now i'm starin` at the sun,
i'm seein` the light, i'm seein the light,
realizing` that it's me in the light,
i read about it ,
heard about it  now i know
i coulda did wrong,
i seen a lot of people hustle,
but i left them things alone,
i almost lost my friend to the struggle,
but i guess that made me strong,
made me strong,
i seen a whole lot of drama,
and it taught me how to fight,
taught me how to fight,
and i thank god for my mama,
she showed me what was right,
i coulda been in the dark,
but thank god for the light,
 i see the light
all the things i heard about,
i read about it, i read about it, oh,
i see the light, i see the light"

"i thought we were great
you took your love back and ran this off track
i count all the days
'til you would come back, how stupid was that
now you're missing what we used to have
guess the vodka brought the feeling back
i was caught up in an aftermath
but now, if you really wanna know
ask how many nights i've been thinking of you, zero, zero
gave a hundred percent but all i got from you, zero, zero
and i thought you were the one
then you turned around
found somebody better
like i never met ya
ask how many nights i've been thinking of you, zero, zero
zero, zero, zero, zero, zero
zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero
that's how many f***s i give
wake up with a dime
get up to no good, better than you could
go out, free our minds
like you never would, never understood
now you're missing what we used to have
you were creeping on my instagram
i was caught up in an aftermath
but now, if you really wanna know
ask how many nights i've been thinking of you, zero, zero
gave a hundred percent but all i got from you, zero, zero
and i thought you were the one
then you turned around
