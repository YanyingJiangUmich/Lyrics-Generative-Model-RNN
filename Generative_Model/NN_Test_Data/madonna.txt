"life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
i hear you call my name
and it feels like home
when you call my name it's like a little prayer
i'm down on my knees, i wanna take you there
in the midnight hour i can feel your power
just like a prayer you know i'll take you there
i hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
i have no choice, i hear your voice
feels like flying
i close my eyes
oh god i think i'm falling
out of the sky, i close my eyes
heaven help me
when you call my name it's like a little prayer
i'm down on my knees, i wanna take you there
in the midnight hour i can feel your power
just like a prayer you know i'll take you there
like a child you whisper softly to me
you're in control just like a child
now i'm dancing
it's like a dream, no end and no beginning
you're here with me, it's like a dream
let the choir sing
when you call my name it's like a little prayer
i'm down on my knees, i wanna take you there
in the midnight hour i can feel your power
just like a prayer you know i'll take you there
life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
i hear you call my name
and it feels like home
just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
just like a dream, you are not what you seem
just like a prayer, no choice
your voice can take me there
just like a prayer, i'll take you there
it's like a dream to me"
"some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
i think they're o.k.
if they don't give me proper credit
i just walk away
they can beg and they can plead
but they can't see the light, that's right
'cause the boy with the cold hard cash
is always mister right
'cause we're living in a material world
and i am a material girl
you know that we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl
some boys romance, some boys slow dance
that's all right with me
if they can't raise my interest then i
have to let them be
some boys try and some boys lie, but
i don't let them play only boys that save their pennies
make my rainy day
'cause we're living in a material world
and i am a material girl
you know that we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl
boys may come and boys may go
and that's all right you will see
experience has made me rich
and now they're after me
'cause we're living in a material world
and i am a material girl
you know that we are living in a material world
and i am a material girl"
"como puede ser verdad
how could it be true?
last night i dreamt of san pedro
just like i'd never gone, i knew the song
a young girl with eyes like the desert
it all seems like yesterday, not far away
chorus:
tropical the island breeze
all of nature wild and free
this is where i long to be
la isla bonita
and when the samba played
the sun would set so high
ring through my ears and sting my eyes
your spanish lullaby
the beautiful island
i fell in love with san pedro
warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
te dijo te amo
i prayed that the days would last
they went so fast
he told you, ""i love you""
i want to be where the sun warms the sky
when it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
beautiful faces, no cares in this world
where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl
last night i dreamt of san pedro
it all seems like yesterday, not far away
la la la la la la la
te dijo te amo
la la la la la la la
el dijo que te ama
he told you, ""i love you""
he said he loves you"

that i still need your love
after all that i've done.
you won't believe me
all you will see is a girl you once knew
although she's dressed up to the nines
at sixes and sevens with you.
i had to let it happen, i had to change;
couldn't stay all my life down at heel:
looking out of the window,
staying out of the sun.
so i chose freedom
running around, trying everything new
but nothing impressed me at all
i never expected it to.
don't cry for me argentina
the truth is i never left you.
all through my wild days, my mad existence,
i kept my promise, don't keep your distance.
and as for fortune, and as for fame;
i never invited them in:
though it seemed to the world
they were all i desired.
they are illusions
they're not the solutions they promised to be,
the answer was here all the time,
i love you, and hope you love me.
don't cry for me argentina
the truth is i never left you.
all through my wild days, my mad existence,

i could make those people dance

if the bible tells you so?
now do you believe in rock n roll
and can music save your mortal soul
and can you teach me how to dance real slow?
well i know that you're in love with him
cause i saw you dancing in the gym
you both kicked off your shoes
man, i dig those rhythm and blues
i was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
with a pink carnation and a pick up truck
but i knew that i was out of luck
the day the music died
i started singing
chorus:
bye bye miss. american pie
drove my chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
and good ol´ boys were drinking whiskey and rye
singing
this will be the day that i die
this will be the day that i die
i met a girl who sang the blues
and i asked her for some happy news
but she just smiled and turned away
well i went down to the sacred store
where i'd heard the music years before
but the man there said the music wouldn't play
well now in the streets the children screamed
the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
but not a word was spoken
the church bells all were broken
and the three men i admire the most,
the father, son, and the holy ghost
they caught the last train for the coast
the day the music died
we started singing
bye bye miss. american pie
drove my chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry

that you'd return when the storm was done
and now i wait for the light
i wait for the sun till i feel your
rain
feel it on my finger tips
hear it on my window pane
your love is coming down like
rain
wash away my sorrow
take away my pain
your love's coming down like
rain
here comes the sun
here comes the sun
and i say never go away
waiting for the hardest thing
it's strange i feel like i've known you before
i tell myself if i believe in you
and i want to understand you
in the dream of you
more and more
with all my heart and all my soul
when i'm with you
that by sheer force of will
i feel like a magical child
i will raise you from the ground
everything strange
and without a sound you'll appear
everything wild
and surrender to me to love
rain is what the thunder brings
for the first time
i can hear my heart sing
call me a fool but i know i'm not
i'm gonna stand out here on the
mountain top
till i feel your
rain
i feel it
it's coming
your love's coming down like
rain
feel it on my finger tips
hear it on my window pane
your love is coming down like
rain
wash away my sorrow
take away my pain
your love's coming down like
rain
rain feel it is coming
your love's coming down like
rain"
"your heart is not open so i must go
the spell has been broken, i loved you so
freedom comes when you learn to let go
creation comes when you learn to say no
you were my lesson i had to learn
i was your fortress you had to burn
pain is a warning that something's wrong
i pray to god that it won't be long
do you wanna go higher
there's nothing left to try
there's no place left to hide
there's no greater power
than the power of goodbye
your heart is not open so i must go
the spell has been broken, i loved you so
you were my lesson i had to learn
i was your fortress
there's nothing left to lose
there's no more heart to bruise

"deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
chorus:
i can't help falling in love
i fall deeper and deeper the further i go
kisses sent from heaven above
they get sweeter and sweeter the more that i know
when you know the notes to sing
you can sing most anything
that's what my mama told me
round and round and round you go
when you find love you'll always know
i let my father mold me
bridge:
daddy couldn't be all wrong
and my mama made me learn this song
that's why
the deeper i go
all is fair in love she said
think with your heart, not with your head
that's what my mama told me
all the little things you do
will end up coming back to you
i let my father mold me
someone said that romance was dead
and i believed it instead of remembering
what my mama told me
let my father mold me
then you tried to hold me
you remind me what they said
this feeling inside
i can't explain
but my love is alive
and i'm never gonna hide it again
deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
never gonna hide it again
sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
never gonna have to pretend
you got to just let your body move to the music
you got to just let your body go with the flow
falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
i can't keep from falling in love with you
you know there's nothing better that i'd like to do"

"dice are rolling, the knives are out

i don't say they mean harm

our nation's leaders are a feeble crew
there's only twenty of them anyway
what is twenty next to millions who
are looking to you?
all you have to do is sit and wait
keeping out of everybody's way
we'll ... you'll be handed power on a plate

for distance lends enchantment, and that is why
all exiles are distinguished, more important, they're not dead
i could find job satisfaction in paraguay

why commit political suicide, there's no risk
there's no call for any action at all

he supports you, for he loves you
understands you, is one of you
if not, how could he love me?

a new argentina, the voice of the people
rings out loud and long
now i am a worker, i've suffered the way that you do
i've been unemployed, and i've starved and i've hated it too
but i found my salvation in peron, may the nation
let him save them as he saved me
a new argentina, a new age about to begin
a new argentina, we face the world together
and no dissent within
there again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
i can see us many miles away, inactive
sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed
sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive
don't think i don't think like you
i often get those nightmares too
they always take some swallowing
sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum
if it's you that you are following
don't close doors, keep an escape clause
because we might lose the big apple
but would i have done what i did
if i hadn't thought, if i hadn't known
we would take the country
peron has resigned from the army and this we avow
the descamisados are those he is marching with now
he supports you, for he loves you
understands you, is one of you
if not, how could he love me?
a new argentina, the chains of the masses untied
a new argentina, the voice of the people
cannot be, and must not be denied
how annoying that they have to fight elections for their cause
the inconvenience, having to get a majority
if normal methods of persuasion fail to win them applause
there are other ways of establishing authority

a new argentina, the voice of the people"

hope they don't hang you, 'cause...

the smell of roses on a lovely summer day

you'd write me poetry
you had a way with words
you said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
maybe i challenged you a little bit too much

because i am here
just for that
i am your moon and your moonlight too
i am your flower garden and your water too

we all fall to the floor at some point.
it's how you pick yourself up   that's the real challenge. isn't it?

i was forced to do something that made me open my eyes.
i realized that this shit ain't no gang.
one of the hommies got popped, and i was pressured to doing my first drive by.
it was kinda f***ed up the way they tried to ser me up.
me and my bro, we was headed vack to the 8 block and some hommies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere.
we pulled up to the corner and he placed a chunky ass gun to my mouth.

why don't you be the man who discovered her

fancy cars that go very fast
you know they never last, no, no
what you need is a big strong hand
to lift you to your higher ground
make you feel like a queen on a throne
make him love you till you can't come down
long stem roses are the way to your heart

satin sheets are very romantic
what happens when you're not in bed
you deserve the best in life

second best is never enough
you'll do much better baby on your own
express yourself
express himself
hey, hey, hey, hey
so if you want it right now, make him show you how
express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

and when you're gone he might regret it
think about the love he once had
try to carry on, but he just won't get it
he'll be back on his knees
to express himself
express himself

what you need is a big strong hand
to lift you to your higher ground
make you feel like a queen on a throne
make him love you till you can't come down

"when i move a certain way
i feel an ache i've kept at bay
a hairline break that's taking hold
a metal that i thought was gold
and pure so sure it strucked a vein
i wanted you to feel the same
so when you did ignite this heart
rescue me from all this dark
see our hearts are intertwined
then i'm free, free of mine
i'm falling free
and see our hearts are intertwined
and then i'm free, i'm free of mine
deep and pure our hearts align
and then i'm free, i'm free of mine
when i raise a certain wing
and crawl beneath that growing thing
it throws a shadow over time
and keeps yours falling next to mine
your days were meant to fly anew
i fall and fold mine into you
and what you take is just enough
and what you give is what i love
and when you lift you raise the sail
and then i'm free, free to fail
i'm falling free
deep and pure our hearts align
and then i'm free, i'm free of mine
when i let lose the need to know
then we're both free, we're free to go
when i lose a certain claim
that tries to know and needs to blame
whatever river runs aground
it turns my head and washes down
the face of god that stands above
pouring over hope and love
that all of might, and life, and limb
could turn around and love again
when i let lose the need to know
then we're both free, free to go
i'm falling free
i'm falling
i'm falling
i'm falling free
i'm falling
i'm falling
i'm falling free
deep and pure our hearts align
and then i'm free, i'm free of mine
when i let lose the need to know
then we're both free, we're free to go

our passion was just too intense to survive

this is a club i should never have joined

"high flying, adored
so young, the instant queen
a rich beautiful thing, of all the talents
a cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint
you were just a backstreet girl
hustling and fighting, scratching and biting
high flying, adored
did you believe in your wildest moments
all this would be yours
that you'd become the lady of them all?
were there stars in your eyes
when you crawled in at night
from the bars, from the sidewalks
from the gutter theatrical
don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
high flying, adored
what happens now, where do you go from here?
for someone on top of the world
the view is not exactly clear
a shame you did it all at twenty six
there are no mysteries now
nothing can thrill you, noone fulfill you
high flying, adored
i hope you come to terms with boredom
so famous so easily, so soon
it's not the wisest thing to be
you won't care if they love you
it's been done before
you'll despair if they hate you
you'll be drained of all energy
all the young who've made it would agree
high flying, adored
that's good to hear but unimportant
my story's quite usual
local girl makes good, weds famous man
i was stuck in the right place at the perfect time
filled a gap, i was lucky
but one thing i'll say for me
no one else can feel it like i can"

you make some little rich girl a toy
my mistake didn't think that you'd be
another victim of a high.. society
all dressed up..
and no where to go
you spent all of your money
and you've got nothin' to show
you've got so much to offer
oh it's just a cryin' shame
you can't buy love with your money
it's not the same

"when did your name change
from a word to a charm
no other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
all of your matters pushed
to the drum of my mouth
and saying your name is somewhere
between a prayer and a shout
and i can't get it out
when did your name change
from language to magic
i'd write it again on the back of my hand
and i know it sounds tragic
feels like a drug
and i can't get enough
and it fits like a glove

i'm addicted to your love
i'm addicted to your love
i'm addicted, i'm addicted, i'm addicted to your love

something happens to me when i hear your voice
something happens to me and i have no choice
i need to hear your name
everything feels so strange
i'm ready to take this chance
i need to dance

you know how this is
if i look at the crystal moon
at the red branch of the slow autumn at my window
if i touch near the fire the impalpable ash or the wrinkled body of the log
everything carries me to you
as if everything that exists   aromas, light, metals
were little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that wait for me
well, now
if little by little you stop loving me
i shall stop loving you
little by little
if suddenly you forget me
do not look for me
for i shall already have forgotten you
if you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my life
and you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where i have roots
remember
that on that day, at that hour, i shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off to seek another land
but, if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness
if each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me
ahh my love, ahh my own, in me all that fire is repeated
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten
my love feeds on your love, beloved"
"if you go away
on this summer day
then you might as well
take the sun away
all the birds that flew
in the summer sky
when our love was new
and our hearts were high
when the day was young
and the nights were long
when the moon stood still
for the night bird's song
.
if you go away
if you go away
if you go away...

but if you stay
i'll make you a day
like no day has been
or will be again
we'll sail on the sun
we'll ride on the rain
we'll talk to the trees
and worship the wind
.
but if you go
i'll understand
leave me just enough love
to hold in my hand
.
if you go away
if you go away
if you go away...
but if you stay
i'll make you a night
like no night has been
or will be again
i'll sail on your smile
i'll ride on your touch
i'll talk to your eyes
that i love so much
.
but if you go
i'll understand
leave me just enough love
to hold in my hand
.
if you go away
if you go away
if you go away...
.
if you go away
as i know you must
there is nothing left
in this world to trust
just an empty room
full of empty space
like the empty look
i see on your face
though i would have been the shadow
of your shadow
if you might have kept me
by your side
.
if you go away
if you go away
if you go away...

if you go away
if you go away...
please, don't go away.

thinking about a friend of mine
he was only 23
gone before he had his time
it came without a warning
didn't want his friends to see him cry
he knew the day was dawning
and i didn't have a chance to say goodbye
chorus:
in this life i loved you most of all
what for?
'cause now you're gone and i have to ask myself
what for?
what for?
driving down the boulevard
thinking about a man i knew
he was like a father to me
nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
taught me to respect myself
said that we're all made of flesh and blood
why should he be treated differently
shouldn't matter who you choose to love
intermediate:
people pass by and i wonder who's next
who determines, who knows best
is there a lesson i'm supposed to learn in this case
ignorance is not bliss
have you ever watched your best friend die have you ever watched a grown man cry some say that life isn't fair i say that people just don't care they'd rather turn the other way and wait for this thing to go away why do we have to pretend some day i pray it will end
i hope it's in this life
i hope it's in this life time"

that this day would come

"blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
and blessed are those who hear
and who keep what is written therein

he is coming with the clouds

everyone who pierced him
and all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him
those of you who have not learned what some call the deep things of satan
i know your works, i know your toil, and your patient endurance
and how you cannot hear evil men
but have tested those who call themselves apostles, but are not
and found them to be false
i know that you are enduring patiently and bearing out for my namesake
and you have not grown weary
but i have this against you
that you have abandoned the love you had
i know your tribulation and your poverty
and the slander of those who say that they are jews, but they are not
they are a synagogue of satan

and a blasphemous name upon its head
and the beast that i saw was like a leopard
its feet were like a bear's
and its mouth was like a lion's mouth
and to it the dragon gave his power, and his throne, and great authority
one of his heads had a mortal wound
but it seemed to have a mortal wound that was healed
and the whole earth followed the beast with wonder
men worshipped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast
and they worshipped the beast saying
""who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast? ""
and the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words
and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty two months
it opened its mouth to utter blasphemous words against god
it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer
and authority was given it over every tribe
and a people and tongue and nation
and all who dwell on earth could worship it in vain
if anyone has an ear let him hear
if anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
if anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword
wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love

then, i saw a new heaven and a new earth
and i heard a great voice from the throne saying
""behold the dwelling of god is with men
he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people
and god himself will be with them
he will wipe away every tear from their eyes
and death shall be no more
neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
for these things will have passed away
to the thirsty i will give water without price
from the fountain of the water of life
he who conquers shall have this heritage
and i will be his god and he shall be my son
but as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
as for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators, and all liars
their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. ""
and he said to me, he said to me
""do not seal up the words of the prophecy, for the time is near
let the evildoers still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy
and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy

"the choice was mine, and mine completely
i could have any prize that i desired
i could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire
or else, or else i could choose time
remember i was very young then
and a year was forever and a day
so what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?
i saw the lights, and i was on my way
and how i lived, how they shone
but how soon the lights were gone
the choice was yours and noone else's
you can cry for a body in despair
hang your head because she is no longer there
to shine, to dazzle, or betray
how she lived, how she shone
but how soon the lights were gone
eyes, hair, face, image
all must be preserved
still life displayed forever"

"he runs through the streets and his socks goin down
and his eyes they burn as they touch the ground
baseball cap holds out the pain
sad no one hears today
goes through the house and he looks for food
he feels so bad but he knows he's good
he lays down on the kitchen floor
he ain't hungry no more
little boy lost
little boy lamb
how much does it cost
to understand
little boy say oh
why do you cry
how much would you pay
to know why
sometimes at night he wets his bed
and his dreams play tricks inside his bed
he wakes up cold turns on the light
there's no one here tonight oh
little boy lost
little boy lamb
how much does it cost
to understand
little boy say
why do you cry
how much would you pay
to know why"
"mmmmm... hey little girl, when you grow up

and take all of the time that you need
little girl never look back
don't let your memories haunt you

you abandoned me

there was nothing i could conceive
that you wouldn't do for me
trouble seemed so far away
you changed that right away, baby

love don't live here anymore
just emptiness and memories
of what we had before
you went away
found another place to stay, another home

everyone can see the loneliness inside me
why'd ya have to go away
don't you know i miss you so and need your love

i'm gonna change your life, i'm like a poison flower

do you remember the time
love hurts, love hurts
when we fell in love
close your eyes, don't be scared
let's put the blindfolds on, let's see what's under there
i have a special chair, it has a special strap
and there's a special hook, it's called my special trap

i'm full of hope
this is not a crime and you're not on trial
bend over baby, i'm gonna make you smile
i'll light the candles, 'til they're nice and soft

"i ran from my house that cannot contain me
from the man that i cannot keep
from my mother who haunts me, even though she's gone
from my daughter that never sleeps
i ran from the noise and the silence
from the traffic on the streets
i ran to the treetops, i ran to the sky
out to the lake, into the rain
that matted my hair
and soaked my shoes and skin
hid my tears, hid my fears
i ran to the forest, i ran to the trees
i ran and i ran, i was looking for me
i ran past the churches and the crooked old mailbox
past the apple orchards and the lady that never talks
up into the hills, i ran to the cemetery
and held my breath, and thought about your death
i ran to the lake, up into the hills
i ran and i ran, i'm looking there still
and i saw the crumbling tombstones
all forgotten names
i tasted the rain, i tasted my tears
i cursed the angels, i tasted my fears
and the ground gave way beneath my feet
and the earth took me in her arms
leaves covered my face
ants marched across my back
black sky opened up, blinding me
i ran to the forest, i ran to the trees
i ran and i ran, i was looking for me
i ran to the lakes and up to the hill
i ran and i ran, i'm looking there still
and i smelled her burning flesh
her rotting bones
her decay
i ran and i ran
i'm still running away"
"i am the promise
that you cannot keep
reap what you sow
find what you seek
i am the sorceress
down, in the deep
i am the earth
under your feet
i am the moon with no light of my own
you are the sun guarding your throne
i heard the angels whisper to me
look for the signs
he is the one
i'll light a candle here in the dark
making my way to your heart
i'll cast a spell that you can't undo
till you wake up and you find that you love me too
till you wake up and you find that you love me too
i'll be the bride that is married to life
you are the day, i am the night
weave you a blanket of silver and gold
i'll keep you warm
do as i'm told
i need your strength that will keep me from harm
i'll be your queen, safe in your arms
don't want to get to the end of my days
saying i wasn't amazed
i'll light a candle here in the dark
making my way to your heart
i'll cast a spell that you can't undo
till you wake up and you find

"i just woke up from a fuzzy dream
you never would believe those things that i had seen
i looked in the mirror and i saw your face
you looked right through me, you were miles away
all my dreams they fade away
i'll never be the same
if you could see me the way you see yourself
i can't pretend to be someone else
you always love me more, miles away
i hear it in your voice, we're miles away
you're not afraid to tell me, miles away
i guess we're at our best when we're miles away
so far away

so far away

so far away
so far away
when no one's around then i have you here
i begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
you always have the biggest heart,
when we're six thousand miles apart
too much of no sound
uncomfortable silence can be so loud
those three words are never enough
when it's long distance love
you always love me more, miles away
i hear it in your voice, we're miles away
you're not afraid to tell me, miles away
i guess we’re at our best when we're miles away

"miss you most of all
when all those autumn leaves start to fall
drifting by my window
they come up over the wall
why does a good thing have to do end
can't see it happen where and when
cycle of change can be so cruel
i've got no one to blame i'm just a fool, you know
hold on they keep on telling me
something's good is gonna come
bread and gold has put its spell on me
and old man winter's gonna come
you know he keeps on blocking off the sun
miss you most of all
when they burn those bonfires tall
smoke and ashes fill the air and the
harvesters are everywhere
no time to waste, let's drink the wine
don't let the fruit rot on the vine
when the sun is big and fiery it goes, you know
that is the time i miss you the most, they say
hold on they keep on telling me
something's good is gonna come
bread and gold has put its spell on me
and old man winter's gonna come
you know he keeps on blocking off the sun
cold wind is howling and there's
darkness creeps in our bones
seasons change, why didn't we
come on bring that summer back to me
hold on they keep on telling me
something's good is gonna come
bread and gold has put its spell on me
and old man winter's gonna come
you know he keeps on blocking off the sun
tell me why does he always have to come?"
"once upon a time i had plenty of nothing,
which was fine with me.
because i had rhythm, music, love,
the sun, the stars and the moon above,
had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.
that was when the best things in life were free.
then time went by and now i got plenty of plenty,
which is fine with me.
'cause i still got love, i still got rhythm,
but look at what i got to go with 'em.
""who could ask for anything more?"", i hear you query.
who would ask for anything more? well, let me tell you, dearie.
got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy i adore.
i'm so happy with what i got, i want more!
count your blessings, one, two, three
i just hate keeping score.
any number is fine with me
as long as it's more
as long as it's more!
i'm no mathematician, all i know is addition
i find counting a bore.
keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.
i got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
got my guy and my sky of blue,
now, however, i own the view.
more is better than nothing, true
but nothing's better than more, more, more
nothing's better than more.
one is fun, why not two?
and if you like two, you might as well have four,
and if you like four, why not a few
why not a slew
if you've got a little, why not a lot?
add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
every jot and tittle adds to the pot
soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
never say when, never stop at plenty,
if it's gonna rain, let it pour.
happy with ten, happier with twenty
if you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?
or does that sound too greedy?
that's not greed, no, indeedy
that's just stocking the store
gotta fill your cupboard, remember mother hubbard.
each possession you possess
helps your spirits to soar.
that's what's soothing about excess
never settle for something less.
something's better than nothing, yes!
but nothing's better than more, more more
except all, all, all
except once you have it all you may find all else above that though things are bliss,
there's one thing you miss, and that's
more! more!
more! more! more! more!"

you can't make me cry, you once had the power
i never felt so good about myself
seems like yesterday
i lay down next to your boots and i prayed
for your anger to end
oh father i have sinned
you can't hurt me now
i got away from you, i never thought i would
you can't make me cry, you once had the power
i never felt so good about myself
oh father you never wanted to live that way
you never wanted to hurt me
why am i running away
maybe someday
when i look back i'll be able to say
you didn't mean to be cruel
somebody hurt you too
you can't hurt me now
i got away from you, i never thought i would
you can't make me cry, you once had the power
i never felt so good about myself"
"oh what a circus, oh what a show
argentina has gone to town
over the death of an actress called eva peron
we've all gone crazy
mourning all day and mourning all night
falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right
oh what an exit, that's how to go
when they're ringing your curtain down
demand to be buried like eva peron
it's quite a sunset
and good for the country in a roundabout way
we've made the front page of all the world's papers today
but who is this santa evita?
why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
what kind of goddess has lived among us?
how will we ever get by without her?
she had her moments, she had some style
the best show in town was the crowd
outside the casa rosada crying, ""eva peron""
but that's all gone now
as soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
we're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years
salve regina mater misericordiae
vita dulcedo et spes nostra
salve salve regina
ad te clamamus exules filii eva
ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
o clemens o pia
hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
our life, sweetness, and hope
hail, hail, oh queen
to you we cry, exiled sons of eve
to you we sigh, mourning and weeping
oh clement, oh loving one
you let down your people evita
you were supposed to have been immortal
that's all they wanted, not much to ask for
but in the end you could not deliver
sing you fools, but you got it wrong
enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
your queen is dead, your king is through
and she's not coming back to you
show business kept us all alive
since seventeen october 1945
but the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin
that's a pretty bad state for a state to be in
instead of government we had a stage
instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
instead of help we were given a crowd
she didn't say much, but she said it loud
sing you fools, but you got it wrong
enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
your queen is dead, your king is through
she's not coming back to you
salve regina mater misericordiae
vita dulcedo et spes nostra
salve salve regina peron
ad te clamamus exules filii eva
ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
o clemens o pia
don't cry for me argentina
for i am ordinary, unimportant
and undeserving of such attention
unless we all are, i think we all are
so share my glory, so share my coffin
so share my glory, so share my coffin"
"(peron has just won a sweeping victory in the 1946 presidential
election. this is the first public appearance by peron and eva
since that triumph.)
people of argentina
your newly elected president, juan peron
argentinos, argentinos
we are all workers now
fighting against our common enemies
poverty, social injustice
foreign domination of our industries
reaching for our common goals
our independence, our dignity, our pride
let the world know that our great nation is awakening
and that its heart beats in the humble bodies
of juan peron and his wife
the first lady of argentina, eva duarte de peron"
"just listen to that, the voice of argentina
we are adored, we are loved
statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants
we shall see little man
i am only a simple woman
who lives to serve peron in his noble crusade
to rescue his people
i was once as you are now, and i promise you this
we will take the riches from the obligarchs
only for you, for all of you
and one day, you too will inherit these treasures
descamisados, mis companeros
when they fire those cannons, when the crowds sing of glory
it is not just for peron, but for all of us, for all of us
things have reached a pretty pass
when someone pretty lower class
can be respected and admired
but our privileged class is dead"
"i live at the top of the hill
no one keeps me against my will
i don't need no save neighbourhood
i got to feel good, my own way
it's not like i don't have a choice
when you're alone, you make it all good
with you and me, you'll be saying it too
cause if something feels good doing your own way
you gotta walk outside when you're down on the ground
and i never see your shit on the ground
and i never want to make a sound
more than i do now
i got away from the talk that's cheap
i don't care 'bout the company i keep
it feels good when it all feels good
i don't want to stand in your way
it's not like i don't have a choice
when you're alone, you make it all good
with you and me, you'll be saying it too
cause if something feels good doing your own way
you gotta walk outside when you're down on the ground
and i never see your shit on the ground

"now eva peron had every disadvantage
you need if you're gonna succeed
no money, no cash
no father, no bright lights
there was nowhere she'd been
at the age of fifteen
as this tango singer found out
agustin magaldi
who has the distinction of being the first
man to be of use to eva duarte
on this night of a thousand stars
let me take you to heaven's door
where the music of love's guitars
plays for evermore
in the glow of those twinkling lights
we shall love through eternity
on this night in a million nights
fly away with me
i never dreamed that a kiss could be as sweet as this
but now i know that it can
i used to wander alone without a love of my own
i was a desperate man
but all my grief disappeared and all the sorrow i'd feared
wasn't there anymore
on that magical day when you first came my way
mi amor
on this night
on this night
on this night of a thousand stars
let me take you to heaven's door
where the music of love's guitars"

i fell asleep and never saw the sun go down
i took your love for granted
thought luck was always on my side
i turned around too late and you were gone

so give me one more chance
darlin' if you care for me
let me win your love
'cause you were always there for me
if you care for me,
be there for me
i like to play the queen of hearts and never thought i'd lose
i rolled the dice but never showed my hand
i planned it out so perfectly,
so you'd never leave a girl like me
i was a fool, but now i understand
here is the law of the land
you play with fire and you'll get burned
here is the lesson i've learned
that you don't know what you've got til it's gone
gimme one more chance
tell me that it's not too late
let me win your love
darlin' please don't hesitate
if you care for me,
be there for me

i gotta do it now i can't be late
i know i'm not afraid i gotta get out the door
if i don't do it now i won't get anymore
you try to criticize my drive
if i lose i don't feel paralyzed
it's not the game it's how you play
and if i fall i get up again now
chorus:
i get up again, over and over
i get up again, over and over
i get up again, over and over
i get up again, over and over
got past my first mistake
i'll only give as much as i can take
you're never gonna see me standin' still
i'm never gonna stop 'till i get my fill
it doesn't matter who you are
it's what you do that takes you far
and if at first you don't succeed
here's some advice that you should heed
i'm not afraid to say i hear a different beat, oh
and i'll go out in the street, yeah
and i will shout it again
from the highest mountain
hurry up 
hurry up, i just can't wait
i gotta do it now i can't be late

"peron is everything, he is the soul, the nerve
the hope and the reality of the argentine people
we all know that there is only one man in our movement
with his own source of light
we all feed from his light, and that is peron
and now she wants to be vice president
that was the over the top, unacceptable suggestion
we didn't approve but we couldn't prevent
the games of the wife of the president
but to give her pretensions encouragement"
" at the watering holes of the well to do
i detect a resistance to
 precisely
 our heroine's style
 we're glad you noticed
 the shooting sticks of the upper class
 give her an inch
 aren't supporting a single ass
that would rise for the girl
 she'll take a mile
such a shame she wandered into our enclosure
how unfortunate this person has forced us to be blunt
no we wouldn't mind seeing her at harrod's
but behind the jewelry counter, not in front
 could there be in our fighting corps
a lack of enthusiasm for
 exactly
 peron's latest flame
 you said it brother
should you wish to cause great distress
in the tidiest officer's mess
just mention her name
that isn't funny
peron is a fool, breaking every taboo
installing a girl in the army h.q.
and she's an actress, the last straw
her only good parts are between her thighs
she should stare at the ceiling, not reach for the skies
or she could be his last whore
the evidence suggests
she has other interests
if it's her who's using him
he's exceptionally dim
b****! dangerous jade
we have allowed ourselves to slip
we have completely lost our grip
we have declined to an all time low
tarts have become the set to know
i am only a radio star with just one weekly show
but speaking as one of the people i want you to know
we are tired of the decline of argentina
with no sign of a government able to give us the things we deserve
it's no crime for officers to do as they please
as long as they're discreet and keep clear of disease
we ignore, we disregard
but once they allow a bit on the side
to move to the center where she's not qualified
we are forced to mark his card
she should get into her head
she should not get out of bed
she should know that she's not paid
to be loud but to be laid
slut! dangerous jade
this has really been your year, miss duarte
tell us where you go from here, miss duarte
which are the roles that you yearn to play?
whom did you sleep ... dine with yesterday?
acting is limiting, the line's not mine
that's no help to the argentine
can we assume then that you'll quit?
is this because of your involvement with colonel peron?
goodnight and thank you
she won't be kept happy by her nights on the tiles
she says it's his body, but she's after his files
so get back on to the street
she should get into her head
she should not get out of bed
she should know that she's not paid
to be loud but to be laid
the evidence suggests
she has other interests
if it's her who's using him

will she see me cry when i stumble and fall
does she hear my voice in the night when i call
wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

i was afraid you'd go away, too

the whole world over just the same
just listen to them call her name

now i don't like to spoil a wonderful story
but the news from rome isn't quite as good
she hasn't gone down like they thought she would
italy's unconvinced by argentine glory
they equate peron with mussolini, can't think why
did you hear that? they called me a whore!
they actually called me a whore!
but signora peron it's an easy mistake
i'm still called an admiral
yet i gave up the sea long ago
more bad news from rome; she met with the pope
she only got a rosary, a kindly word
i wouldn't say the holy father gave her the bird
but papal decorations, never a hope
she still looked the part at st. peter's, caught the eye
 will evita win through?
 but the answer is ...
 a qualified
 yes
eva started well, no question, in france
shining like a sun through the post war haze
a beautiful reminder of the care free days
she nearly captured the french, she sure had the chance
but she suddenly seemed to lose interest
she looked tired
face the facts, the rainbow's starting to fade
i don't think she'll make it to england now
it wasn't on the schedule anyhow
you'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
some kind of coming home in triumph is required
 would evita win through?

 yes

 no

thought i belong to a different tribe, walking alone

outgrown my past and
i've shed my skin

you don't know it's worth
so how could you know that this aching inside me
is so strong that it hurts?
and i'm wondering where you are
and i'm looking up at the stars
wishing that it didn't hurt so much
remembering your touch
i'm wishing that it didn't hurt so much
remembering your touch
you never said goodbye
i woke up and found you were gone
you take what you can from each situation
and then you move on
you'll never change your ways
and i was a fool to believe
so if you have so many admirers
why did you pick on me?

"i'm talking, i'm talking
i believe in the power of love
i'm singing, i'm singing
i believe that you can rescue me
with you i'm not a little girl, with you i'm not a man
when all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand
you see that i'm ferocious, you see that i am weak
you see that i am silly, and pretentious and a freak
but i don't feel too strange for you
don't know exactly what you do
i think when love is pure you try
to understand the reasons why
and i prefer this mystery
it cancels out my misery
and gives me hope that there could be
a person that loves me
chorus:
rescue me your love has given me hope
rescue me i'm drowning, baby throw out your rope
with you i'm not a fascist, can't play you
like a toy
and when i need to dominate, you're not my little boy
you see that i am hungry for a life of understanding
and you forgive my angry little heart
when she's demanding
you bring me to my knees while i'm scratching out the eyes
of a world i want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
and right while i am kneeling there
i suddenly begin to care
and understand that there could be
a person that loves me
love is understanding
it's hard to believe life can be so demanding
i'm sending out an s.o.s.
stop me from drowning baby i'll do the rest
rescue me your love has given me hope rescue me i'm drowning, baby throw out your rope 
ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding
ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding
love is understanding
it's hard to believe life can be so demanding
i'm sending out an s.o.s.
rescue me, rescue me
it's not my business to decide
how good you are for me
how valuable you are
and what the world can see
only that you try to understand me
and have the courage to love me for me
i believe i believe that you can rescue me
i'm singing i believe
i believe that you can rescue me
i'm singing, i'm singing, i'm singing
i believe that you can rescue me
i'm talking, i'm talking
i believe in the power of love
i'm singing, i'm singing, i believe
i believe that you can rescue me

"there is no such thing as revenge
you will not give as good as you got
there is no such thing as an eye for an eye
if you think you're the giver, you're not
there is no such thing as regret
there is no point in placing the blame
hate destroys the one who hates
and everyone suffers the same
what you see
is not necessarily what you get
eyes are the window to the soul
take your judgements
and let them go
there is only love and respect
to thine own self be true
when you point the finger,
there are three fingers pointing back at you
what you see
is not necessarily what you get
eyes are the window to the soul
take your judgements
and let them go
let them go
let them go
let them go
recognize that god is alive in everyone
recognize that love lives in us all
what you see
is not necessarily what you get
eyes are the window to the soul
take your judgements
and let them go

let them go

he had a harem of dancing girls at his command
he owned all the eye could see
something was wrong, he wasn't happy
and then it happened much to his surprise
the loveliest woman he'd ever seen
he asked her name and she replied
 scheherazade
she was the daughter of the grand vizier
a real beauty with a heart of gold, she was so sincere
she made a date with destiny
marry the king, make him happy
he was enchanted on their wedding night
just a captive under her spell
spending a thousand and one arabian nights
 scheherazade
all of his body tingled with delight
hearing the stories she loved to tell
she was a vision, such a lovely sight
 scheherazade
he made a promise on the morning star
he would change, throw away his scimitar
so she came to stay
and that's the way the story goes
until this very day

i wonder if i'll ever know

a lover without scorn

will i still be thirsty
will i pass the test
and if i look for the rainbow, will i see it
or will it pass right by
'cause i'm not supposed to see
'cause the blind are never free
even at my secret garden
there's a chance that i could harden
that's why i'll keep on looking, for
i still believe, i still believe
'cause after all is said and done
i'm still alive
and the boots have come and trampled on me
and i'm still alive

and i'm strong, and there's a chance
that i will grow, this i know

lies my secret garden"

i don’t wanna have to fight

one or two of the things we promised to?

find a place to call your own

every time your shoe hits the avenue
and when you’ve gone they’ll sing a song
of the stories you told when you felt so bold
you better think twice when you cross the ice
everything you do comes back to you
when you’re shedding a tear sidewalks will hear
when your laughter’s true they’ll run with you
you can do it, uh huh

you'll make some little rich girl a toy
my mistake, didn't think that you'd be
another victim of a high society
all dressed up and nowhere to go
you spent all of your money
and you got nothin' to show
got so much to offer
oh, it's just a crying shame
you can't buy love with your money
it's not the same

"some girls can do anything
whole world hanging on a string

fake tits and a nasty mood
hot shit when she's in the nude
some girls got a sexy slur
one drink and its all a blur
cash now if you wanna flirt
some girls going off the deep end
some girls living for the weekend
some girls like to get the freak on

"seems i've played the game for much too long
i let people buy my love and i
never got to sing my songs for you.
i had all my bets laid all on you
set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose.
in the game of love you pay your dues.
say that happiness cannot be measured,
and a little pain can bring you all life's little pleasures.
what a joke.

i was not your woman, i was not your friend,
but you gave me something to remember.
no other man said love yourself
nobody else can.
we weren't meant to be,
at least not in this lifetime,

i hear you still say, ""love yourself"".
i had all my bets laid all on you
set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose.
in the game of love i've paid my dues.
guess i'm waiting for my place in your sun,
wish i had the chance to know you and it wasn't stormy weather.
what a shame, who's to blame?"
"sooner or later you're gonna be mine,
sooner or later you're gonna be fine.
baby, it's time that you face it,
i always get my man.
sooner or later you're gonna decide,
sooner or later there's nowhere to hide.
baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
let's settle the matter.
baby, you're mine on a platter,
i always get my man.
but if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me.
the more you resist, babe, the more it excites me.
and no one i've kissed, babe, ever fights me again.
if you're on my list, it's just a question of when.
when i get a yen, then baby, amen.
i'm counting to ten, and then ...
i'm gonna love you like nothing you've known,
i'm gonna love you, and you all alone.
sooner is better than later but lover,
i'll hover, i'll plan.
this time i'm not only getting, i'm holding my man."

she won't help the hungry once a month at your tombolas
she'll simply take control as you disappear
forgive my intrusion, but fine as those sentiments sound
little has changed for us peasants down here on the ground
i hate to sound childish, ungrateful, i don't like to moan
but do you now represent anyone's cause but your own?"
"blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
and blessed are those who hear
and who keep what is written therein
for the time is near
he is coming with the clouds
and every eye will see him
everyone who pierced him
and all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him
those of you who have not learned
what some call the deep things of satan
i know your works
i know your toil
and your patient endurance
and how you cannot hear evil men
but have tested those who call themselves
apostles
but are not
and found them to be false
i know you are enduring patiently
and bearing out
for my namesake
and you have not grown weary
but i have this against you
that you have abandoned
the love you had
i know your tribulation and your poverty
and the slander of those who say
that they are jews
but they are not
they are a synagogue of satan
do not fear what you are about to suffer
behold the devil is about to throw you into prison
wanting
needing
waiting
for you
to justify my love
hoping
praying
for you
to justify my love
and i saw a beast rising out of the sea
with ten horns and seven heads
and a blasphemous name upon its head
and the beast that i saw was like a leopard
its feet were like a bear's
and its mouth was like a lion's mouth
and to it the dragon gave his power
and his throne
and great authority
one of his heads had a mortal wound
but it seemed to have a mortal wound
that was healed
and the whole earth followed the beast with wonder
men worshipped the dragon
for he had given his authority to the beast
and they worshipped the beast saying
""who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?""
and the beast was given a mouth
uttering haughty and blasphemous words
and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty two months
it opened its mouth to utter blasphemous
words
against
god
it was allowed to make war on the saints
and to conquer them
and authority was given it over every tribe
and a people and tongue and nation
and all who dwell on earth could worship it
in vain
if anyone has an ear let him hear
if anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
if anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword
wanting
needing
waiting
for you
to justify my love
hoping
then
i saw a new heaven
and a new earth
and i heard a great voice from the throne saying
""behold the dwelling of god is with men
he will dwell with them
and they shall be his people
and god himself will be with them
people will wipe away every tear from their eyes
and death shall be no more
neither shall there be mourning
nor crying
nor pain
anymore
for these things will have passed away
to the thirsty i will give water without price
from the fountain of the water of life
he who conquers shall have this heritage
and i will be his god and he shall be my son
but as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
as for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators
and all liars
their lot shall be in the lake
that burns with fire and brimstone""
and he said to me
he said to me
""do not seal up the words of the prophecy
for the time is near
let the evildoers still do evil
and the filthy still be filthy
and the righteous still do right
and the holy still be holy
behold
i am coming soon
i am the alpha
and the omega
the first
and the last
the beginning
and the end""
amen
what are you gonna do?"

"in june of forty three there was a military coup
behind it was a gang called the g.o.u.
who did not feel the need to be elected
they had themselves a party at the point of a gun

involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots
was colonel juan peron, would be dictator
he began in the army out in italy so
saw mussolini's rise from the very front row
i reckon he'd do likewise sooner or later
yeah, just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain, kapow, die
they haven't a chance, bye bye
the terrorists advance
but one guy doesn't dirty his hands
peron was biding time out in the slow lane
yeah, suddenly an earthquake hit the town of san juan, kapow, die
they stumble and fall, bye bye
keep away from the wall
but one guy was having a ball
the tragedy, a golden chance for peron
he organized a concert with incredible flair
in aid of all the victims, such a grand affair
politicians, actors, stars of every flavor
it was january twenty second, 1944
a night to remember, yeah, that's for sure

why did it have to end
and why do they always say
don't look back
keep your head held high
don't ask them why
because life is short
and before you know
you're feeling old
and your heart is breaking
don't hold on to the past
well that's too much to ask
live and learn
well the years they flew
and we never knew
we were foolish then
we would never tire
and that little fire
is still alive in me
it will never go away
can't say goodbye to yesterday 
no regrets
but i wish that you
were here with me
well then there's hope yet
i can see your face
in our secret place
you're not just a memory
say goodbye to yesterday those are words i'll never say 
this used to be my playground this used to be our pride and joy
this used to be the place we ran to
that no one in the world could dare destroy
this used to be our playground this used to be our childhood dream
this used to be the place we ran to
i wish you were standing here with me
this used to be our playground this used to be our great escape
this used to be the place we ran to
this used to be our secret hiding place

he starts to scream, the vases fly
he wishes that she wouldn't cry
he's not in move with her anymore
he makes demands, she draws the line
he starts the fight, she starts the lie
but what is truth when something dies
he's not in love with her anymore
you're not in love with someone else
you don't even love yourself

i am to blame, i used to be someone else
no one got through, nothing came inside the gate
you made me feel when my heart was set on hate
i convinced myself that i was invincible
but i didn't know that feelings can lie too
you exposed my deepest wound, but i felt so safe
didn't know that you had never loved me
every time you say good bye
it feels like the end of the world
every time i start to cry
i feel like the most tragic girl
you were so good at pretending that you care
i was alone, even with you standing there
you made me doubt everyone that cared for me
i shut them out so that you'd be all i see
i convinced myself that i was invincible
but i didn't know that feelings can lie too
you exposed my deepest wound, but i felt so safe
didn't know that you had never loved me
every time you say good bye
it feels like the end of the world
every time i start to cry
i feel like the most tragic girl

hurt for a while, but i'm finally moving on
said it, did it, hit it, quit it
then you let it go
see you tried to call me, but i blocked you on my phone
it took a minute, but right now i'm feeling strong
it almost killed me, but i'm better off alone
now you say it that you're sorry, i don't wanna know
better face the fact you had to go
it might sound like i'm an unapologetic b****
but sometimes you know i gotta call it like it is
it might sound like i'm an unapologetic b****

oh f*** you
it might sound like i'm an...
it might sound like i'm an...
i know you'd like it if i stayed home and cried
but that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
when we did it, i'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
when the gun was loaded you were never on my side
i'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
i'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
said it, did it, loved it, hated it
i don't care no more
tell me how it feels to be ignored?
it might sound like i'm an unapologetic b****
but sometimes you know i gotta call it like it is
it might sound like i'm an unapologetic b****
but sometimes you know i gotta call it like it is

"who is the master, who is the slave?
treat me like a curse,
then tell me i'm your savior
i 'm never with the stranger
i used to know so well
waiting for your answer is a kind of torture
could i grow accustomed to this kind of hell
are you walking the dog?
'cause that dog isn't new
are you out of control,
is that dog walking you?
haven't you had enough,
now your time is up
baby show me your hand
voices start to ring in your head,
tell me what do they say
distant echoes from another time
start to creep in your brain
so you play madness, like it's convenient
you do it so often that you start to believe it
you have demons so nobody can blame you
but who is the master and who is the slave?
first you say you love me,
then you wanna leave me
then you say you're sorry,
you play the game so well
i bought your illusion,
you're the greatest salesman
how could i refuse you
when you sold it to yourself
are you walking the dog?
'cause that dog isn't new
are you out of control,
is that dog walking you?
haven't you had enough,
now your time is up
baby show me your hand
voices start to ring in your head,
tell me what do they say
distant echoes from another time
start to creep in your brain
so you play madness like it's convenient
you do it so often that you start to believe it
you have demons so nobody can blame you
but who is the master and who is the slave?"
"well, i know from experience
that if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
it wasn't yours in the first place
and that's hard to accept when you love someone
and you're led to believe in their moment of need
that they want what you want but they don't
bridge:
don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
baby, you're no good
and you hurt me like no other lover ever could
don't go making me cry
you're gonna say goodbye
baby, tell me why
tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this
chorus :
waiting for you
this waiting
can't you see i'm waiting for you
don't break my heart
it was so easy in the beginning
when you didn't feel like running from your feelings like you are now
what happened? what do i remind you of?
your past, your dreams
or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
i wish i could believe you
or at least have the courage to leave you
life has taught me that love with a man like you
is only gonna make me blue
but i love you anyway no matter what you do
you don't come around here like you did before
when you did adore
tell me what i did to deserve this
intermediate:
finally i see a different man
only love can hurt like this can
finally i see a different face
tell me who is going to take my place
i knew it from the start that you would desert me
you're gonna break my heart
baby, please don't hurt me
i knew it from the start that you would desert me
you're gonna break my heart
baby, please don't hurt me
break my heart
don't break my heart
break my heart
you broke my heart 
uh, next time you want p****, huh
just look in the mirror baby... uh..."
"tell me before i waltz out of your life
before turning my back on the past
forgive my impertinent behavior
but how long do you think this pantomime can last?
tell me before i ride off in the sunset
there's one thing i never got clear
how can you claim you're our savior
when those who oppose you are stepped on,
or cut up, or simply disappear?
tell me before you get onto your bus
before joining the forgotten brigade
how can one person like me, say,
alter the time honored way the game is played?
tell me before you get onto your high horse
just what you expect me to do
i don't care what the bourgeoisie say
i'm not in business for them
but to give all my descamisados
a magical moment or two
there is evil, ever around
fundamental system of government
quite incidental
so what are my chances of honest advances?
i'd say low
better to win by admitting my sin
than to lose with a halo
tell me before i seek worthier pastures
and thereby restore self esteem
how can you be so short sighted
to look never further than this week or next week
to have no impossible dream?
allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines
and mark your adieu with three cheers
but first tell me who'd be delighted
if i said i'd take on the world's greatest problems
from war to pollution, no hope of solution
even if i lived for one hundred years
there is evil, ever around
fundamental system of government
quite incidental
so go, if you're able, to somewhere unstable
and stay there
whip up your hate in some tottering state
but not here, dear
is that clear, dear?
oh what i'd give for a hundred years
but the physical interferes
every day more, o my creator
what is the good of the strongest heart
in a body that's falling apart?"
"in a world that's changing
i'm a stranger in a strange land
there's a contradiction
and i'm stuck here in between
life is a like a desert
an oasis to confuse me
so i walk this razor's edge
will i stand or will i fall
turned a blind eye
tried to pretend that nothing is what it seems
torn between the impulse to stay or running away
from all this madness
who am i to decide what should be done?
if this is the end then let it come
let it come, let it rain
rain all over me
like the tide, let it flow
let it wash all over me
over me, let it wash all over me
over me, let it wash all over me
all of my illusions
could be shattered in a second
you could thread a needle
with a teardrop from my eye
it's a cruel injustice
to be witness to the things i see
looking for the answer
when it's right in front of me
from the tower of babylon
where nothing is what it seems
gonna watch the sun going down
i'm not gonna run from all this sadness
who am i to decide what should be done?
if this is the end then let it come
let it come, let it rain
let it rain, rain all over me
like the tide, let it flow
let it wash all over me
over me, let it wash all over me
over me, let it wash all over me"

you can't hit a moving target"
"what can you lose?
only the blues.
why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
say it to her, what can you lose?
maybe it shows,
she's had clues, which she chose to ignore.
maybe though she knows,
and just wants to go on as before.
as a friend, nothing more
so she closes the door.
well, if she does
those are the dues.
once the words are spoken,
something may be broken.
still, you love her
what can you lose?
but what if she goes?
at least now, you have part of her.
what if she had to choose?
leave it alone
hold it all in.
better a bone

with so much to win,
there´s too much to lose"
"warm inside, yeah
i'd like to direct your attention
to something that needs directing to
a lot of people talk about
dining in and eating out
i guess that's what this song's about
i know this is not
a dining room conversation
and you don't have to listen
if you don't have the time
but let me remind you
in case you don't already know
dining out can happen down below
everybody's talkin' 'bout
wanting that and needing this
i'd just like to know
if you want to learn
a different kind of kiss
so won't you go down
where it's warm inside
go down where i cannot hide
go down where all life begins
go down that's where my love is
now what could be better
than a home cooked meal
how you want to eat it
depends on how you feel
you can eat all you want
and you don't get fat
now where else can you go
for a meal like that
it's not fair to be selfish or stingy
every girl should experience eating out
sometimes when i come home
from a hard day at work
i swear it's all i can think about
everybody's talkin' 'bout
wanting that and needing this
i'd just like to know
if you want to learn
a different kind of kiss
so won't you go down
where it's warm inside
go down where i cannot hide
go down where all life begins
go down that's where my love is
colonel sanders says it best
""finger lickin' good""
let's put what you've learned to the test
can you make a fire without using wood
are you still hungry;
aren't you glad we came
i'm glad you brought your raincoat
i think it's beginning to rain
everybody's talkin' 'bout
wanting that and needing this
i'd just like to know
if you want to learn
a different kind of kiss
so won't you go down
where it's warm inside
go down where i cannot hide
go down where all life begins
go down that's where my love is
that's where my love is
come inside
that's where all life begins
it's warm inside"

your words
you think you're so sly
i caught you at your game
you will not bring me shame with your words
too much blinding light
your touch, i've grown tired of your words

a linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation
conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
in short, a lie
a message from heaven, a signal from hell

pour ce soir, pour toujours
keeping touch my little body
dis moi la vérite
oui je sais toujours.
you have a special quality
you're bringing out the very best in me
you have a special quality
you are pulling me closer to you honesty"
"your little body's slowly breaking down
you're losing speed, you're losing strength, not style
that goes on flourishing forever
but your eyes, your smile
do not have the sparkle of your fantastic past
if you climb one more mountain it could be your last
i'm not that ill, bad moments come but they go
some days are fine, some a little bit harder
but that doesn't mean we should give up our dream
have you ever seen me defeated?
don't you forget what i've been through and yet
i'm still standing
eva, you are dying
so what happens now?
where am i going to?"
