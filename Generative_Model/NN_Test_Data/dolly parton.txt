fine clothes and diamond rings?
it just don't mean a thing
if you ain't got love

they promised forever
no matter whatever

they knew in their hearts, they could not live apart
so they started making their plans
so she rented a bridal gown, he rented a tux
a bouquet of bluebonnets and, in his fancy new truck
they drove faster and faster, as fast as could go
'til they crashed in a field of bluebonnets below
they placed a marker saying may you rest in peace

guide my path and be my light
and may god provide the means
to accomplish my big dreams, my big dreams

then i thought i heard somebody at my door a' knockin'
i wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm
then i saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
before i could say a word she said, 'my name is sandy
and this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little andy'
standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
then i asked her to come in and this is what she said
chorus:

ain't ya got no candy
ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little andy

and we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
i wonder if you'll let us stay with you
giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
can we stay all night
if you don't love us no one will
i promise we won't cry
london bridge is fallin' down
my daddy's drunk again in town
and we was all alone and didn't what we could do
i wonder if you'll let us stay with you
she was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
but that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
god knew little andy would be lonesome with her gone

duet with porter wagoner
writer dolly parton
copyright 1970
mendy is sixteen and uncontrolable mendy is only a child
mendy is in with the in crowd mendy is ever so wild
mendy's hair hangs straight and long mendy feels this is a must
mini skirts and many friends and many horrors for us
mendy finds a plenty to do but mendy never sleeps
mendy slips out of the house in the evening when the sun is sinkin'
mendy is out with the in crowd mendy is smokin' and drinkin'
there's a different shine in mendy's eyes and the color is gone from her cheeks
mendy is a swinger but mendy never sleeps
mendy never sleeps and mendy is growing weak
mendy lies lifeless and limpid are her eyes now oh mendy please don't go to
sleep"
"at my door the leaves are fallin'
a cold wild wind will come
sweet hearts walked by together
and i still miss someone
i go out to a party
and look for a little fun
but i find a darkened corner
cause i still miss someone
chorus:
oh i never got over those blue eyes
i see them everywhere
i miss those arms that held me
when all the love was there

and i wonder if he's sorry
for leaving what we begun

aw, but i still miss somone"

june 2nd 1964 nashville tennesee
dear mom and daddy i hope this letter finds everybody well and happy
as for me i'm fine i guess i'm just a little lonesome and a whole lot homesick

cause i knew you'd be worried about me
and i don't let you know to worried about me cause i'm gonna be alright
once i get settled and used to bein' away from home
i didn't realize how much i loved you and all them noisy kids until i left
and i didn't reaize how hard it was to eave home eiter
till i started to leave and everybody started cryin' includin' me
i cried almost all the way to nashville
and i wanted to turn around a few times and come back
but you know how bad i've always wanted to go to nashville
and be a singer and songwriter
and i believe that if i try long enough and hard enough that someday i'll make it
don't worry about tryin' to send me any money or anything
cause i've got a job singin' on the early morning television show
here called the eddie hill show
and a couple of folks already told me that they might record a couple of my songs
so i'll be makin' enough money to get by
and i don't want you to worryin' about me bein' hungry or anything
and nashville's not exactly what i thought it was gonna be
but i believe i'm gonna like it here once i get used to it
and i don't want you to worryin' about me gettin' in trouble either
cause i'll be good just like i promised you i would when i left
well can't think of anything else to say
i guess i'd better close for now and you write me real soon
and tell everybody i said hello and i'm gonna be real anxious to hear from you

so proud that i finally won.
and when the losin's all done.
well, i'm gonna shine like the sun.
i'm gonna shine, i'm gonna shine.
i'm gonna shine like the sun.
when these clouds roll away from my door.
and when it's all said and done
i won't be at your mercy no more.
i'll be off chasin' rainbows,
rejoicin' and havin' my fun.
and when the cryin's all done,
well, i'm gonna shine like the sun.
when the cryin's all done,
when the tryin's all done,
when the lyin's all done
there'll be nothin' but sun.
when it's all said and done
well, i'm gonna shine like the sun.
shine like the sun, shine like the sun."
"back through the years
i go wonderin' once again
back to the seasons of my youth
i recall a box of rags that someone gave us
and how my momma put the rags to use
there were rags of many colors
every piece was small
and i didn't have a coat
and it was way down in the fall
momma sewed the rags together
sewin' every piece with love
she made my coat of many colors
that i was so proud of
as she sewed, she told a story
from the bible, she had read
about a coat of many colors
joseph wore and then she said
perhaps this coat will bring you
good luck and happiness
and i just couldn't wait to wear it
and momma blessed it with a kiss
chorus:
my coat of many colors
that my momma made for me
made only from rags
but i wore it so proudly
although we had no money
i was rich as i could be
in my coat of many colors
my momma made for me
so with patches on my britches
holes in both my shoes
in my coat of many colors
i hurried off to school
just to find the others laughing
and making fun of me
in my coat of many colors
my momma made for me
and oh i couldn't understand it
for i felt i was rich
and i told them of the love
my momma sewed in every stitch
and i told 'em all the story
momma told me while she sewed
and how my coat of many colors
was worth more than all their clothes
but they didn't understand it
and i tried to make them see
that one is only poor
only if they choose to be
now i know we had no money
but i was rich as i could be
in my coat of many colors
my momma made for me
made just for me"
"can't say we're lovers, can't say we're friends
don't even know if i'll see you again
but against your warm body i felt so alive
and you got me over a heartache tonight
my heart was broken, my hurt was deep
i had lost something i wanted to keep
lookin' for comfort when you caught my eye
and you got me over a heartache tonight
chorus:
sweet conversation, a drink and a dance
led to an evening of making romance
and i don't even care if it's wrong or it's right
'cause you got me over a heartache tonight
2nd chorus:
yes, you got me over a heartache tonight
stirring up passion brought me back to life
oh, and it may not last, but who know it just might
but you got me over a heartache tonight
yes, you got me over a heartache tonight"
"10 4 over and out the way we talk sometimes you'd think our love is filled with doubt
but when we're all alone by the fireside of our home
the angry words we spoke that day have forever gone away then it's love we talk about
to the world outside we say 10 4 over and out
hello this is unit 2 callin' unit 1 this is unit 2 tryin' unit 1
do you read me unit 1 do you read me
(yeah i read you unit 2 i sure can read you just like a book is all

or sometimes even more hours long

i'm gettin' sick of foolin' around with this cb radio

(i read you mhm do i golly i read you unit 1 loud and clear
but seems like there's a little turbulence on the line
honey i'm sorry that i'm runnin' so late but i stopped off here
to see this friend of mine who's been awfully awfully sick
and when i got back to the car you know this radio had run my battery down
i know it's hard for you to believe)
oh i believe you i really do believe you ole cb and you 10 4 over and out
10 4 over and out...
10 4 baby i'm gonna have to be clear with you i'm always movin' on

everybody in the country knows what we're talkin' about too
they listen in on us i know i know"
"4 0 33
duet by dolly parton and porter wagoner
writer earl montgomery
copyright 1966
well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
and we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
well we found love and happiness people envy us you see
for we found heaven right here on earth at 4 0 33
yes we found what most people are looking for
and it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
but it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
and there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4 0 33
four thousandth block proves what true love can do
once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
oh all around the house you can see little children play
but they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
they are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
they're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4 0 33
our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
for look at the house they think there from the sky
they think this place would make them as happy as you and me
and the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4 0 33
four thousandth block proves what true love can do...
and we're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4 0 33
wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had"
"there's a bit of magic in a simple little smile
something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile
and there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand
a gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand
oh if people would stop taking and just once try to give
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live
la la la la la la la la la la la la
and if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
we could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me
la la la la la la la la la la la la
all life has to offer that's what most folks desire
but offer nothing in return, cause they don't seem to care
and if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live
and if we'd all climb together, we could climb the highest hill
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live
and if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
we could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me
la la la la la la la la la la la la"
"you've made this a christmas to remember
springtime feelin's in the middle of december
strangers meet and they willingly surrender
oh! what a christmas to remember
almost went to aspen but something told me no
i considered mammoth but there wasn't enough snow
and i even thought of gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go
so i headed up to tahoe for a christmas on the slopes
and i had fantasized about christmas in this way
curled up by a fireplace in a tahoe ski chalet
with a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood
but even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and
you've made this a christmas to remember
springtime feelin's in the middle of december
change the radio and i'll turn the lights down dimmer
oh! what a christmas to remember
strangers when we met, lovers as we leave
christmas to remember, too good to believe
don't know how or when, but i know we'll meet again
we'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind
and you've made this a christmas to remember
springtime feelin's in the middle of december
neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender
oh! what a christmas to remember
we loved and laughed and played and joked
sang christmas songs and talked to folks
sleighed the fields and skied the slopes
then to the lodge for dinner
but now it's time for us to go
as our hearts melt like chimney snow
there's just one thing i want to know
can we do this next winter
oh! what a christmas to remember
you've made this a christmas to remember
springtime feelin's in the middle of december
though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer
oh! what a christmas to remember
you've made this a christmas to remember
springtime feelin's in the middle of december
though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers
oh! what a christmas to remember"
"sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do
he'll lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose
what is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool
she swears she never knew but always needed to
but stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys i suppose
even love can't change the things he ought to change the most
and it's pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees
makin' apologies but she loves him desperately
oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet
so he'd know all the perfect lines to say
and have some great romantic way to show it
be the hero ridin' up to save the day
and go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor
to sweep her up and carry her away
oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her
no cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways
""i love you"" and ""i'm sorry"" are words that just don't come
cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue
but his eyes keep tellin' her ""you know i love you anyway
no matter what i say or what i never say""
oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet
so he'd know all those fancy lines to say
and have some great romantic way to show it
be the hero ridin' up to save the day
and go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor
and sweep her up and carry her away
oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her
no cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways
his ways seem cold but she knows he's much warmer
but even love can't change a cowboy's ways
he's just a fool that must defend his honor
but even love can't change a cowboy's ways"
"just a few old memories
slipped in through my door
though i thought i had closed it
so tightly before
i can't understand it
why it should bother my mind
for it all belongs to another place and time
just a few old keep sakes
way back on the shelf
no, they don't mean nothin'
well i'm surprised they're still left
just a few old love letters
with the edges all brown
and an old faded picture
i keep turned upside down
just a few old memories
going way back in time
well i can hardly remember
i don't know why i'm cryin'
i can't understand it
well i'm surprised myself
first thing tomorrow morning
i'll clean off that shelf
just a few old keep sakes
way back on the shelf
no, they don't mean nothin'
well i'm surprised that they're left
just a few old love letters
with their edges all brown
and an old faded picture
i keep turned upside down"
"loving you isn't good for me
you keep my tears flowing
if i left you i couldn't stay gone
so there's no use in going
loving you is a habit i can't break
i haven't found a way yet
but i've been trying
to stop loving you but i can't wait
there's no use in lyin'
loving you is a habit i can't break
loving you is a habit i can't break
i've been loving you much too long now
to change the way i feel
so i might as well get used to these heartaches
loving you is a habit i can't break"
"it's just a little bitty pissant country place
ain't nothin' much to see
no drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
it's just a piddly squatin' old time country place
ain't nothing to hide at all
just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
but there's nothing dirty going on
nothing dirty going on
we get simple farmers, local business men
congress folks from austin, young boys looking for sin
now we used to get a lot of rough necks, when the oil boom was high
but pay day would get a little rowdy, thank god the field ran dry
chorus:

i don't hire no married girl, they're not on the ball
they got homes and husbands, they're not stable at all
you know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day
now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away
repeat chorus
keep your language clean girls, keep your bedrooms neat
and don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street
mind you p's and q's and manners, and you don't need no other tools

beds are not to be wallowed in
that's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do
and it don't make money!
betrix!
i won't tolerate no tying my telephone with other peoples business
eloise honey!
and please don't show us no tattoos
no hearts and flowers on your thigh
it's downright tacky
brands for the cattle and that ain't what we're selling at miss mona's
do you catch my drift?
i pay the food and the rent and the utilities
you keep your mind on your work responsibilities
don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
and we can get along
dawn!
any bad habits you come in with, get rid off right now
tatty joe!
i can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow
lindy lue!
any one taking sick leave for to make real sure their sick
and every time you hear that bell...
you better get here double quick
and as for pimps
pimps are something you don't need
to get your daily business done
are you listening good?
keep them leaches and blood suckers of the bathrobes
and i know how to use a gun
and nobody messes with my girls
and any questions you might have about the way i run this place
don't grip and whine behind my back
just tell me face to face, i'm open minded, say it all
then go upstairs and pack, the door's that way
she pays the food and the rent and the utilities
we keep our mind on our work responsibilities
don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
and we can get along

"as you walk away
as we say goodbye
what i wouldn't give
for a tender lie
say you'll never stop loving me
just as if it were true
how much more damage, now honestly
could one tender lie do
when we fall so far
are we wrong to try
to keep out the truth
with a tender lie
say you're gonna come back to me

you treat me mean and cold and cruel
you make me do things that i hate to do

you treat me mean and it ain't right nor fair
i keep holdin' on though i don't know what to
while you make me act like a fool
you know just how to hurt me and you often do
when we're out in publib i start fightin' with you
you start trouble in private when nobody knows
oh, then you go away smellin' just like a rose
though you make me act like a fool
you treat me mean cold and cruel
you make me do things that i hate to do
oh, why must you make me act like a fool?
you know just how to hurt me as you often do
you start flirtin' in public with somebody new
you start trouble in private when nobody knows

"dolly parton   afraid to live and afraid of dying
they say most anything you eat could hurt your health
be careful what you drink, don't harm yourself
and pollution in the air might make you sick
makes you afraid to live, afraid that you might die too quick
do the men that quote this danger really know
life is gift to be enjoyed and not to worry so
the biggest danger sign that we should know
make sure we're right with god, as through this world we go
we're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
and afraid to love the one we love, afraid they might be lyin'
we can't enjoy life when they say each thing might bring an early grave
we're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
do the men that quote this danger really know?
life is gift to be enjoyed, why worry so?
the biggest danger sign that we should know
make sure we're right with god, as through this world we go
make sure we're right with god, as through this world we go"
"dolly parton   afraid to love again
if every time that you got hurt it left a scar
and if every dream you ever had broke your heart
if every time you made a plan the world came to an end
then you'd know why i'm afraid to love again
if broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known
and hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
and if you should find misery to be your only friend
then you'd know why i'm afraid to love again
if every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun
pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone
if everything you try should fail before you can begin
then you'd know why i'm afraid to love again
then you'd know why i'm afraid to love again"
"well i dreamed i saw the knights in armor coming
saying something about a queen
there were peasants singing and drummers drumming
and the archer split the tree
there was a fanfare blowing to the sun
there was floating on the breeze
look at mother nature on the run
in the twenthty century
look at mother nature on the run
in the twenthy century
i was lying in a burned out basement
with the full moon in my eyes
i was hoping for replacement
when the sun brust through the sky
there was a band playing in my head
and i felt like i could cry
i was thinking about what a friend had said
i was hoping it was a lie
thinking about what a friend had said
i was hoping it was a lie
i dreamed i saw the silver spaceships flyin'
in the yellow haze of the sun
there were childeren crying and colors flying
all around the chosen ones
all in a dream,all in a dream, the loading had begun
flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home"
"the cold december wind seems bent on rockin' new york city
the town that's got me down to my last dime
and everywhere i go, the people seem in such a hurry
to keep this mobile girl from feelin' fine
chorus:
lord, what i'd give to see an alabama sundown
the sun just seemed to drop in mobile bay
new york town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down
but that never was the mobile way, no, no
that never was the mobile way
a flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar
in anybody's town, that price is cheap
it's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards
'cause i need ninety cents to go to sleep

that gentleman would surely learn to pray

"dolly parton   anyplace you want to go
crushed velvet drapes the walls of the room
pillows all colors shapes and sizes on the floor
mirrors on the ceiling reflect the candles burning low
just close your eyes and travel anyplace you want to go
to lover's lane or far away to the mountain peaks of spain
crise along the amazon where the deep blue waters flow
our imagination will take us anyplace you want to go
thought we can only go there in our minds
cause we cannot afford such luxuries so kind
the little room we live in is not much we both know
but the dreams we share can take us anyplace we want to go
tonight we'll go to some majestic island ride the waves when the tie is rising
lying in the silver sands where gentle breezes blow
the beauty of our love can take anyplace we want to go
to lover's lane...
anyplace you want to go"
"friends ask how i'll get along without you they say it's so sad we're apart
i have to agree that i don't seem like me i'm havin' a ball with my heart
anything's better than nothing nothing's not too much to lose
anything's better than nothing nothing's what i have with you
i've got to admit that it hurts me i don't like to fight or to fuss
but now you and me are just happy we're free and everyone's crying but us
anything's better than nothing...
it really must be disappointment to see love and dream turn to smoke
i can't blame my friends when their teardrops begin
i once thought that love made a home
anything's better than nothing...
nothing's what i have with you..."
"you oughta go north somebody told us
æ…ause the air is filled with gold dust
and fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
now i donæš° recall you said it
but weæšž lived so long on credit
and so we headed out to find our promised land
just poor appalachian farm folk
with nothing more than high hopes
we hitched our station wagon to a star
but our dreams all fell in on us
'cause there was no land of promise
and itæš¯ a stuggle keepin?sight of who you are
oh and these northern nights are dreary
and my southern heart is weary
i wonder how the old folks are back home
but iæš£l keep leanin?on sweet jesus
i know heæš£l love and guide and lead us
appalachian memories keep me strong
ya know iæš³e been thinkin?a whole lot lately
about whatæš¯ been and what awaits me
it takes all iæš³e got to give what life demands
you go insane if you give in to it
lifeæš¯ a mill and iæš³e been through it
iæš¦ just thankful iæš¦ creative with my hands
oh and these northern nights are dreary
and my southern eyes are teary
donæš° i wonder how the old folks are back home
but iæš£l keep leanin?on my jesus
i know heæš£l love and guide and lead us
appalachian memories keep me strong
iæš£l keep lookin?to the father
keep our heads above the water
appalachian memories keep me strong"
"he lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack
his real name was jackson taylor but i called him applejack
now old applejack was loved by everyone he ever knew
applejack picked apples but he picked the banjo too
chorus:
play a song for me applejack, applejack
play a song for me and i'll sing
play a song for me applejack, applejack
play a song, let your banjo ring
now i'd go down to applejack's almost everyday
we'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old applejack had made
then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if i'd sing
and he would play the banjo and i'd play my tambourine
repeat chorus
that's when i was just a kid and now that i am grown
all i have are memories, old applejack is gone
oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
and everytime i play it i still hear applejack
repeat chorus 3 times"

you've always hurt me
but i always forgive
and i'll hurt for as long as i love you

"he came to me like a bright idea
shining like the sun
and the way his eyes burned into mine
i knew he must be the one
oh, he drew me in like a magnet does
so i couldn't pull away
but the kind of lovin' that i gave to him
i'm not ashamed to say
1st chorus:
oh, as soon as i touched him
soon as i touched him
i felt like a woman
and the feelin' made me close my eyes
i was born again
an' i heard myself cryin'
like a new born baby cries
he told me what i meant to him
swore that i was sent to him
all my lovin' went to him
now he's gone, oh, he's gone
now i hide myself from the light of day
so no one else can see
a part of him that i can't forget
that's growin' deep inside of me
2nd chorus:
oh, as soon as i touched him
soon as i touched him
i felt like a woman
and the feelin' made me close my eyes

good friends, they seem to slip away so fast
an' i know we're both headed down seperate tracks

there won't be no more sleepin' over on a tuesday night
no more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight
no more dancin' after hours

i know what your eyes say
your eyes reflect love and desire
i see that you need me
i need you to please me
you touch me and set me on fire
it's the way that you love me
the way that you touch me
the way that you whisper my name
i cannot resist you
each time i kiss you
then everything goes up in flames
chorus:
baby i'm burning out of control
baby i'm burning body and soul
hot as a pistol of flaming desire
baby i'm burning

the fire you've ignited
just stand back and watch the sparks fly

"back home, back home
yes, i'm going back home
why i can't believe it's been this long
since i've seen mom and dad
when i left my mountain home behind
i left them both so sad
my brothers and my sisters that were babies then are grown
years have past and now at last, i'm on my way back home
back home, back home
yes i'm going back home
to the factory smoke and city life, i'm sayin' so long
i've shed a lot of tears through all the years that i've been gone
and i've spent a lot of time a' wishin' i could go back home
i got a letter from mama an'
mama asked me if i'd come back home
she says it sure is lonesome now
since all of us kids are all growed up and gone
i just can't hardly stand the thoughts of
momma and daddy being left there all alone
that's really all i need to know
and now i'm on the road back home
back home, back home
yes, i'm going back home
to the smog an' smoke an' city life, i'm sayin' so long
i've shed a lot of tears through all the years that i've been gone

"i grew up poor and ragged
just a simple country girl
i wanted to be pretty
more than anything in the world
like barbie or the models in the fredricks' catalog
from rags to wishes
in my dreams i could have it all
i'm just a backwoods barbie
too much makeup, too much hair
don't be fooled by thinkin'
that the goods are not all there
don't let these false eyelashes
lead you to believe that
i'm as shallow as i look
'cause i run true and deep
i've always been misunderstood
because of how i look
don't judge me by the cover
'cause i'm a real good book
so read into it what you will, but see me as i am
the way i look is just a country girl's idea of glam
i'm just a backwoods barbie
in a push up bra and heels
i might look artificial
but where it counts i'm real
and i'm all dolled up
and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth
and even backwoods barbie's
get their feelings hurt
i'm just a backwoods barbie
too much makeup, too much hair
don't be fooled by thinkin'
that the goods are not all there
yes, i can see where i could be misjudged upon first glance
but even backwoods barbie's
deserve a second chance
i'm just a backwoods barbie
just asking for a chance
just a backwoods barbie"
"i went into his prison cell
to write his story, if he'd tell
he spoke as tears, fell from his eyes
and he told me when, and how and why
and he said
i asked my love to take a walk
just to walk, a little ways
and as we walked, then we could talk
about our future wedding day
but when she said, she could never be mine
i held a knife against his breast
as into my arms she pressed
he cried ""my love, don't you murder me
i'm not prepared for eternity""
then only say that you'll be mine
and in no others' arms entwine
down beside where the waters flow
down by the banks of the ohio
i started home 'tween twelve and one
i cried, ""my god, what have i done? ""
i've killed the one i love tonight
because she would not be my bride
well only say that you'll be mine
and in no others' arms entwine
down beside where the waters flow
down by the banks of the ohio
down by the banks of the ohio
save my soul lord
save my soul
there beside where the waters flow
down by the banks of the ohio"
"last night you called me barbara
as you lay fast asleep
and although i'm not barbara
you wanted me to be
you whispered words i haven't heard
in such a long, long time
last night you said i love you
with barbara on your mind
sometimes i find traces of her kisses on your skin
and strands of chestnut hair
that say you've been with her again
little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find
last night you called me darlin'
with barbara on your mind
with barbara on your mind
you held me in your arms so tight
and lying there so close to you
i cried until day light
and though you think that i don't know
i'm really not that blind
last night you said i love you
with barbara on your mind
last night you called me darlin'

nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
but i'll fly away to you, if only pretending
we'll be like bluebird do, the beautiful lie

"i lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep
and wonder who i was before i loved you
lying here beside you feeling so complete
thinking how i love and need and trust you
because i love you i'm a brand new person now because you love me
i can face the world and have the cause i love you
because you love me because i love you
sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying there
and let you soon awake and reach to hold me
and anyway you want me that's the way that i am yours
love as strong as this lets you control me
because i love you...
because i love you..."
"i'm sorry i was weak enough to step out on you
well i should have been strong enough not to step out on you too
i know that i'd hurt you and i stepped out for spite
because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
i'm not making excuses for myself i was wrong as i could be
but you shouldn't have cheapened yourself trying to get even with me
my conscience bothers me mine won't let me sleep at night
because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
two wrongs don't make one right and now we both got heartaches
but if we both try we can forgive each other for our mistakes
we let no wonderful love slip through our hands we's better hold on tight
because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right"
"writers charles l. seitz, joe lewis, elmar rader
i thought i had seen pretty girls in my time that was before i met you
i never saw one that i wanted for mine that was before i met you
i thought i was swinging the world by the tail i thought i could never be blue
i thought i'd been kissed and i thought i'd been loved but that was before i
met you
i thought i'd stay single and always be free but that was before i met you
and i said that no sweet thing could ever hold me but that was before i met you
i thought i was swinging...
i thought i was swinging...
that was before i met you"
"what are we doing in this place alone is our desire to relive our past this strong
true love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on
let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold
if we live our past in the present our future will be gone
let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
line with temptation we raced into the past
on a road too small to let the past and the present pass
are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone
let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
long ago we let the flame...
let's go home before our weakness gets too strong"

then i wish you both the best

darling i want you to know
i'll run to you if ever you should call
and if i should ever hear
that she's made you shed a tear
i'll be there before the next teardrop falls
i'll be there anytime you need me by your side
to dry away each teardrop you've cried
if she ever leaves you blue
just remember i love you
and i'll be there
before the next teardrop falls

does she really love you way that i love you
does she treat you right even when you've done wrong
if she's woman enough to forgive you way that i'm willing to
if she ain't then don't go for i still love you so we all make mistakes i know
give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind

i will fight 'til the end
i'll lay down and die if i must

this soap opera play that we're in
is just like you watch on t.v.
but i never thought that i'd ever get caught in it;
starring you, him and me

you fight fire with fire

why they're gonna just roll right on away,
i know they are,

all this blue ain't sky and sea,

""dolly, what's your secret?
with all you do, your attitude

well i'm not the dalai lama, but i'll try
to offer up a few words of advice
chorus:
you better get to livin', givin'
don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'
and lovin' on the way
you better get to knowin', showin'
a little bit more concerned about where you're goin'
just a word unto the wise
you better get to livin'
a girlfriend came to my house
started cryin' on my shoulder sunday evening
she was spinnin' such a sad tale
i could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'
so negative the words she had to say
i said if i had a violin i'd play
i said you'd better get to livin', givin'
be willing and forgivin'
cause all healing has to start with you
you better stop whining, pining
get your dreams in line
and then just shine, design, refine
until they come true
and you better get to livin'
your life's a wreck, your house is mess
and your wardrobe way outdated
all your plans just keep on falling through
overweight and under paid, under appreciated
i'm no guru, but i'll tell you
this i know is true
you better get to livin', givin'
a little more thought about bein'
a little more willin' to make a better way
don't sweat the small stuff
keep your chin up
just hang tough
and if it gets too rough
fall on your knees and pray
and do that everyday
then you'll get to livin'
the day we're born we start to die
don't waste one minute of this life
get to livin'
share your dreams and share your laughter
make some points for the great hereafter
better start carin'
better start sharin'
better start tryin'
better start smiling
and you better get to livin'"
"i've been sittin' here looking at the clock big daddy
allready you're a half hour late.
i've been pulling back the curtains, peeping out the window
wish you wouldn't make me wait
you better move it on home, boy, you better move it on home.
i've been sittin' here listening to the jukebox playing
and forgettin' where i ought to be.
zipping on a cool one having me some good fun
time got away from me.
i better move it on home, i better move it on home.
better spin them wheels and make it on back
to heaven on earth and lovers' at
like a rolling stone, you better move it on home.
i've been here cooking you a nice hot supper
and you can't even eat it on time
heating up the meat loaf and stiring up the gravy
is kind a messing up my mind
you better move it on home boy, you better move it on home.
i've been speeding through the traffic, passing everyone
i remember what i forgot.
stepping on the gas and driving kind of fast
hoping i wont get stopped.
better move it on home, better move it on home.
she: better move it on home, boy right on this time or i'm gonna shake it.
he: i'm on my way babe, but the traffic is murder
she: that's what i thought the trouble is at home, if you're not at home soon.
he: traffic is messing up my mind
she: ... and you're messing up mine."
"we're all together once again
for the first time in i don't know when
we were so close once upon a time
there were five of us kids at home
two girls, three boys and dad and mom
but that was in the better part
of life we left behind
remember that old swimming hole
where we would swim so long ago
and all them possum grapes and muskedines
and do you recall the time
we all got drunk on homemade wine
that was in the better part
of life we left behind
life was simple for us then
if only it could be again
how i wish we could go back in time
but time moves on and nothin' lasts
except the memories from the past
memories from the better part
of life we left behind
remember how we talked as kids
of what we'd be when we got big
and all the dreams that we held in our minds
i wanted to be a singin' star
and you all said that i'd go far
but that was in the better part
of life we left behind
remember all the fun we had
back when they say times were bad
and life was good to us and things were fine
we had fun and we had love
and a mom and dad to care for us
but that was is the better part
of life we left behind
life was simple for us then
if only it could be again
how i wish we could go back in time
but time moves on and nothin' lasts
except the memories from the past
memories from the better part
of life we left behind
sweet memories from the better part
of life we left behind"
"there's a bit of magic in a simple little smile
something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile
and there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand
gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand
oh if people would stop taking and just once try to give
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live la la la la la la
and if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
we could afford the price of peace love is all it costs
oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me la la la la la la
all life has to offer that's what most folks desire
but offer nothing in return cause they don't seem to care
and if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live
and if we'd all climb together we could climb the highest hill
we could make the world we're living in a better place to live la la la la la la
and if we'd love one another..."
"let's start by stopping long enough to talk things over
since there's a new love burning between us
with openminded understanding between us
let's both feel free to talk of this new love
let there be no deep dark secrets between us let's never hide behind a false disguise
let there be no hidden feelings between us an honest love is a love that will survive
in our love let's share a friendship between us always close enough to talk things out
let's be honest with ourselves and with each other
and our love will never know mistrust or doubt
let there be no deep dark secrets...
an honest love is a love that will survive"

you know we can't be slow take the kids and get below

and the way she looked at me and said
big wind's a comin'...
oh but dad was on the cellar and by now the sky was yellow
the wind was blowin' trees were fallin'
and outside i heard him cryin' and as he lay there dyin'
it seemed i could still hear him sayin'
big wind's a comin'...
big wind big wind's comin'"
"in my home town of blackie, kentucky
he came passin' through one dark, gloomy day
and i considered myself as lucky
when he told me he would take me away
and though he was older, it made me no difference
his promise of riches was all i could see
at last i could leave the coal mines of kentucky
and know something better than sad poverty
blackie, kentucky, you know that i'll miss you
but there are other places in the world i'd like to see
so i must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin'
but i'll always hold you in my memory
but i've never adjusted to sociable livin'
the friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me
thousands of miles from blackie, kentucky
in a mansion with a husband that never loved me
he won't let my family and friends come to visit
because they are country and poor, he's ashamed
oh, but i'd give my life, lord, if i could just go see them
all that's changed about me is my name
blackie, kentucky, oh lord, how i miss you
if i could come back home, i'd never leave you anymore
i'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal minin' daddy
and mama, and the kids, and the friends i knew before
my world is as black as the coal in kentucky
he won't let me leave him   there's no way to win
i'll take my own life, dear god, please forgive me
but i've got to get back home to blackie once again
an' i've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it
it's my last request and he can't refuse me
i've told him to bury me back in blackie, kentucky
where my family and my friends can come and visit me
blackie, kentucky i'm comin' home to you
but different from the way you remember me before
so make me a place and i'll lay me down to rest
and i'll sleep in your arms forevermore
i'll sleep in your arms forever more"
"blue me, blue me
blue is the color
that fits best on me
i'm blue
just as blue as can be
blue me, blue me
i cry
and i die
i lie awake at night
and i question why
must it be
i can never be free
blue me, blue me
my heart is heavy
but it's empty inside
no one to love me
or to lay down beside
i'm blue
the queen of sorrow
wears royal blue
my luck ain't changin'
is it ever goin' to
i'm blue, oh i'm blue
why must i wear this robe of blue misery
blue me, blue me
ooh
this sad old feeling
is breakin' me down
no satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round
lord, i'm blue
oh, i'm so blue
why can't i shake it tell me where will this end
when will i get out of this blue rut i'm in
oh, i'm blue
looks like the blues just took a liking to me
blue me, blue me
blue me, blue me
blue is the color that fits best on me
ooooh, i'm blue
i'm just as blue as can be

"she was born in a place called blue valley
at the foot of the tennessee hills
with the blue birds and blue bells
and blue mountain water
and the sound of the blue whippoorwill
but there was no peace in the valley
her daddy, a cruel, ruthless man
used and abused her mind and her body
so her mama said run while you can
so at fifteen she took to the highway
belongings and guitar in hand
and she buried herself in her music
the one thing she did understand
and she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet
her voice has that high, lonesome sound
she hurts, and her songs are the best way to show it
so the blue valley songbird keeps traveling around
she hopes someday she will make it
and everyone says that she will
when she comes to town, crowds flock around
to see the girl from the tennessee hills
she writes her letter back home to her mama
in care of the preacher in town
they're sacred to her so she reads them at church
and so her daddy cannot track her down
and she sings like a bird and she cries like a baby
whenever she turns off the lights
she's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazy
from mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry
blue dress, blue shoes, a blue cadillac
a band dressed in blue by her side
instruments tied to the top and the back
'cause the blue valley songbird is singing tonight
one nighters, honky tonks, years flying by
she never made it, but lord knows she tries
expressing the feelings she holds inside
and the blue valley songbird is singing tonight
oh the blue valley songbird is singing tonight
and she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet"
"i was lookin' for greener pastures
when i left my old kentucky home
i was chasin' after dreams i thought i'd master
so i left the one that loved me all along
thinkin' only of myself and doin' better
didn't care about the grief i left behind
didn't even make a card or write a letter
so sure i'd be successful in no time
now i'm heading for bluer pastures
and back to the one who's heart i broke
to the bluegrass state of kentucky
where he waits with open for me i hope
ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?
how what you have is never good enough
how the years will find you searchin' through your plunder
lookin' for the treasures you gave up
well the seasons came, they went
the dreams all shattered
while the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown
then i realized i'd lost all that had mattered
so with foolish pride aside, i'm homeward bound
now i'm heading for bluer pastures
and back to the one who's heart i broke
to the bluegrass state of ole kentucky
where he waits with open for me i hope
now i'm heading for bluer pastures
where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind
where the bluegrass music's always playin'
to the haunting sound of monroe's mandolin
i'm heading for bluer pastures"

bobby's arms always welcome me inside
bobby's arms always hold me when i cry
bobby's arms are my shelter from life's storms

bobby's arms reach for me and i surrender
when he reaches out for me, i'm never out of reach

"i don't want to hear a love song
i got on this airplane just to fly
i know there's life below me
and all that you can show me is the prairie and the sky
i don't want to hear a sad story filled with hearbreak and desire
the last time i felt like this
i was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire
and i stood on the mountain in the night
and i watched it burn, i watched it burn, i watched it burn
chorus:
i would rock my soul in the bosom of abraham
i would hold my life in a saving grace
i would walk all the way from boulder to birmingham
if i thought i could see, see your face
well you really got me this time
and the hardest part is knowing i survive
and i've come to listen to the sounds of trucks
as they moved out on highway 95
and pretending it's the ocean coming to wash me clear
to wash me clear if you know what i mean

"the bridge so high the bridge so tall here is where it's started on bridge
the moon is big and yellow and the stars're all aglow
from the bridge i see reflection in the waters far below
you kissed me for the first time here held me awfully tight
and the bridge became our favorite place we came here often in the night
one night while standing on the bridge desire swept through a spoke
passion took us by the hand and showed us where to go
from the bridge we saw a meadow so we ran together there
where we found love together hurry motions filled the air
the bridge so wide the bridge so long
where once we stood together tonight i stand alone
tonight while standing on the bridge my heart is beating wild
to think that you could leave me here with our unborn child
my feet are moving slowly closer to the edge
here is where it's started and here is where i'll end it"

bubblin' over with the joy that only love can bring
bubblin' over with the song you taught my heart to sing
and i'm so happy lovin' you that anyone can see
that i'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over

i have never known a love that felt like this
you're the one i want to share my lovin' with
your gentle way of lovin' me and your thoughtfulness

"when i look at you
i melt like a candle
you light a fire in me
what am i to do
i just hope i can handle
the heat and the smoke blinding me
this feeling, this fire
this burning desire
is raging its way through my soul
and if you feel the same
help me fan the flames
'til we're burning out of control
burning to know you
burning to show you
and i've felt this way from the start
burning with passion
i do hope it's lasting
and it's burning a hole in my heart
you kindle in me
a warm glowing feeling
a spark and a flicker of hope
it's more than a game
and like moths to a flame
we're drawn to its warmth and its glow
these embers of love
are fueled by the notion
this could be an eternal flame
consumed by the blaze
i fear it's too late
'cause this torch that i hold bears your name
oh, and i'm burning to know you
burning to hold you
it's grown to a flame from a spark
burning with passion
i do hope it's lasting
and it's burning a hole in my heart
oh, i'm burning with passion
i do hope it's lasting...
i've had so many dreams fall apart...
and it's burning a hole in my heart...
i'm burning

ties bind us both with someone else we don't want to hurt but we must break
and tonight i'll sit home a thinkin' and tonight i'll sit home a drinkin'
we both live in seperate homes where there's no love at all
stayin' up late burning the midnight oil
tomorrow we'll meet here in the same place where love and desires just won't
wait
in each other's arms we'll dream for a little while
then when it's time to leave it'll nearly drive us wild

i can't believe
that i've been such a fool

i might find
someone who would play by the rules

now here i stand
my heart in your hands...
and i've gone from burning to burned
ah, you'd think by now
i'd know how
to keep this heart of mine safe
it goes to show
you just never know
who can you trust these days
how could i make
the same mistake
but as far as i'm concerned
got myself to blame
got to close to the flame
now i've gone from burning to burned
everyone knows
the old saying goes
that a fool in love
never learns

'cause the fire was too hot...
now i've gone from burning to burned

was all we'd need to live
what a life we'd have

should be keepin' us apart

you know that i love you

had not yet crossed my mind

i'd come runnin' back to you
i'd come runnin' back to you

live on dreams alone
got to pay the rent
so i must leave you all alone

remember how we used to go and visit fairy land
remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end
but you loved me then
and the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run
and the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun
and the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind
but you loved me then
now i walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand
when you left i lost my way forever and the fairy land

in a diamond studded chalice
on an emerald plated tray
i would bring to you sweet nectar

"in a dream i was walkin' in a beautiful field
i was gathering flowers at the foot of a hill
when a bright light descended and it spread o'er the land
jesus stood on the mountain and he held out his hand
then he came down from the mountain, headed down to the sea
and the children strowed flowers in the path at his feet
and he was filled with compassion and the beasts from the wild
came as gentle as lambs and they all walked at his side
there's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd
there's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about
there's a light in the darkness, there's joy in his love
ain't that a wonderful feelin', let us lift him up
then he suddenly vanished from the crowd down below
reappeared on the mountain in a radiant glow
he said your questions are many but the answer is love
i'll draw all men unto me if i be lifted up
there's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd
there's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about
there's a light in the darkness, there's joy in his love
there is life everlasting, let us lift him up
he said if i
be lifted up
he said if i be lifted up, what did he say
he said if i
be lifted up
he said if i be lifetd up

and higher and higher each day
let's lift him up

be lifted up

"so often in my dreams
i hold you close against my skin
waking up i wish that could
sleep and dream again
cause only when i sleep
can i not hear how it's a sin
how cheaters never win
their heartaches never end
""torn between two lovers"" on the jukebox
and i'm thinking how i could've wrote that song
wonderin' if god loves us
when we're cheatin'
but why he lets us feels things if it's wrong
i guess i should be singing ""rock of ages""
""amazing grace"", some of those good songs
can't find it in my heart to ask forgiveness
anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
thou shalt not commit it
it's written in the tin
the spirit is always willing
but the flesh is weak again
and you're as close to heaven
as i might ever fly
an angel in disguise
a wrong that feels so right
and torn between two lovers just keeps playing
and i don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong
it goes against all i've ever stood for
knowin' i have someone else at home
i guess i should be singing ""rock of ages""
""amazing grace"", some of those good songs
but my cheatin' heart can tell on me tomorrow
cause anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
to hell with heaven if it means i'll lose you
anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
it just can't be"

she shouted back at me
said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun
not part, not half

no money down
no credit line

you're the travelin' kind
thirty days in the jailhouse
four days on the road

my feet, a heavy load
i saw a greyhound comin'
stuck out my thumb
as soon as i was seated

white christmas and i'm blue
like fireworks with no fuse
christmas without you
the fireplace keeps burning and my thoughts keep turning
the pages of memories of time spent with you
old christmas songs we knew and used to make love to
make it hard to get used to
christmas without you
christmas without you
white christmas and i'm blue
i love you i miss you
so sad but so true
christmas without you
like a mystery with no clues
like fireworks with no fuse
christmas without you
the sweetest gift i know would be if the new snow
could fall on your footsteps on this christmas eve
the most joyous christmas if luck could be with us
would be if saint nicholas brought you home to me
christmas without you
white christmas and i'm blue
i love you i miss you i need you
so sad but so true
like a mystery with no clues
like fireworks with no fuse
christmas without you

'til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill
and when daddy got word of the revenue
he made us kids help hide his brew
made us swear that we never knew
about daddy's moonshine still
yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line
once a week with a load of moonshine
and the wounds that came from that won't ever heal

my two brothers lost their lives

my daddy's moonshine still

from daddy's moonshine still
my bootlegging daddy was known quite well
and he made our home a livin' hell

so young and do fine
and seek not your fortune
in the dark, dreary mines
it will form as a habit
seep in your soul
'til the blood in your veins
runs as black as the coal

that i've known in my day
who lived just to labor
his whole life away
like a fiend with his dope
and a drunkard his wine
a man will have lust for
the lure of the mine
it's dark as a dungeon
damp as the dew
the danger is double
and the pleasures are few
where the rain never falls
where the sun never shines
it's dark as a dungeon
way down in the mine
i hope when i'm gone
and the ages shall roll
my body will blacken
and turn into coal
then i'll look out the door
of my heavenly home
and i'll pity the miners
a diggin' my bones
it's dark as a dungeon
damp as the dew
the danger is double
and the pleasures are few
where the rain never falls
where the sun never shines

that i can touch the sky

kindness wipes away regret; hope can conquer fear
tenderness, a soothing balm, healing wounds and scars
love says we can start anew right from where we are

dover
i found a place to stay out on a farm taking care of an old lady
she never asked me nothing so i never talked to her about my baby
i sent a message to my mamma with the name and address of myself over
and to make sure he got that information when he came down from dover
i loved him more than anything and i could not refuse him when he needed me
he was the only one i'd loved and i just can't believe that he was using me
he wouldn't leave me here like this i know it can't be so it can't be over
he wouldn't make me go through this alone, oh he'll be coming down from dover

the babies in those mountains

and she's a sparrow when she's broken
but she's an eagle when she flies
a kaleidoscope of colors
you can toss her around and round
you can keep her in you vision
but you'll never keep her down
she's a lover, she's a mother
she's a friend and she's a wife
and she's a sparrow when she's broken
but she's an eagle when she flies
gentle as the sweet magnolia
strong as steel, her faith and pride
she's an everlasting shoulder
she's the leaning post of life
she hurts deep and when she weeps
she's just as fragile as a child
and she's a sparrow when she's broken
but she's an eagle when she flies
tag:
she's a sparrow when she's broken
but she's an eagle when she flies
oh, bless her, lord
she's an eagle when she flies"
"i open up my door to greet the early morning sun
closing it behind me and away i do run
to the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree
in the meadow i go walking in the early morning breeze
i cup my hands to catch a multi colored butterfly
perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild
freeing it i watch it as it flies away from me
to visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
chorus:
rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun
the aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
in the meadow where i'm walking in the early morning breeze
misty eyed i look about the meadow where i stray
for its there i find the courage to greet the coming day
for there among the flowers i kneel gently to my knees
to have a word with god in the early mornig breeze
2nd chorus:
a rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun
the aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
in the meadow where i'm walking in the early morning breez"
"you might wake up some morning
to the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
and if you're quick enough to rise
you'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
out on the new horizon
you may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
and if the sleep has left your ears
you might hear footsteps running through an open meadow
don't be concerned, it will not harm you
it's only me pursuing something i'm not sure of
across my dreams, with nets of wonder
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
you might have heard my footsteps
echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
i might have even called your name
as i ran searching after something to believe in
you might have seen me runnin'
through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behind
if you remember something there
that glided past you followed close by heavy breathing
don't be concerned, it will not harm you
it's only me pursuing something i'm not sure of
across my dreams, with nets of wonder
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
across my dreams, with nets of wonder
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
across my dreams, with nets of wonder
i chase the bright elusive butterfly of love"
"it's just one emotion after another
they will dress themselves as angels and theives
they will make you believe you're in heaven
then they'll drag you through hell on your knees
it's just one emotion after another
one day i'm up just as high as it goes
next day i'm down to the lowest of lows
i do love you baby but we can't get along
with or without each other it's al right or it's all wrong
it's hard to determine where the balance should be
we swear it's forever while we're packing to leave
each time we end it i swear never again
but the minute you come knockin' i can't wait to let you in
it's just one emotion after another
they will dress themselves as angels and theives
they will make you believe you're in heaven
then they'll drag you through hell on your knees
it's just one emotion after another
it's been that way since lovim' began
like an ocean love flows with it's highs and it's lows
like the tide it just goes out and in
it's just one emotion after another
it's just one emotion after another
but i guess that's just the way that it goes
love is rainbow and rain, love is pleasure and pain
i cannot stay the same i suppose
but i love you and that's all i know"
"i cry awake at night and hug my pillow
and pray that i will die before i wake
no such luck
another day of cryin'
don't know how much more my old heart can break
flooded with these memories and emotions

they say that i'll forget
but my face is just as wet
as it was the day you left this town
chorus:
drowning in this endless, endless
drowning in an endless stream of tears
it's relentless and i'm defenseless
drowning in an endless stream of tears
i can't believe that i can talk about it
i never thought i'd live to see this day
but a broken heart won't kill you
you just want to die
but you have to go on livin' anyway
i feel it through and through
and i've never been so blue
and i cried a river over you

cause i know this could never work out
but honey, how love grows
even though there's no reason to doubt
this can never be
you keep saying it's wrong
neither one of us is free
still i want to hold on
chorus:
when even a fool would let go
cause he knows that there's no use in trying
even a child would say no
when he knows that he'll end up crying
tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
even a fool would let go
love has no reason
like the words in a song that don't rhyme
my love has no season
i just know that it's there all the time
maybe just you and me
i can't believe that it's wrong
thinking about you and me
just makes me want to hold on

"my train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter
something badly needed to brighten up the chores
seemed old mrs. bailey had accidentally fell
in the water being used to scrub the floors
now mrs. bailey was the meanest matron at the home
she believed in lots of work with little play
and we laughed till we bent double
though we knew we'd get in trouble
but trouble's all we had at evening shade
now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding
to teach you love and keep you off the streets
and all the kids that live here are said to be a problem
juvenile delinquents so to speak
but understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger
an iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate
the reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared
but they cared even less at evening shade
little susan bradley, one night had wet her bed
mrs. bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death
and i knew that something must be done to put an end to this
and so i started talking plans with the older kids
plans were that joe johnson would steal the kerosene
and i would get some matches when nobody seen
beckie adams would make sure the kids were all outside
billy watson would look out for the evil eye
now mrs. bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day
we knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway
now that its all over and the sun is going down
there's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground"

she tries to keep them both together
she's barely getting by, saving everything she makes
day by day it seems it's getting harder to win
how much longer, ready for their ship to come in
these are the times of the everyday hero
this is the battlefield of the working man
trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can
with a fire in his soul that keeps burning
and a dream in her heart that won't die

he promised her a life of luxury
and though they don't have riches they have everything they need
the eyes of her child are her diamonds
the gift of his love are her pearls
together they plan, taking a stand to make this a better world
but never breaking, knowing that their dreams will begin
getting stronger in each other's arms
these are the times of the everyday hero

or watch the sun set at the end of the day
i get kind of moody when i see such beauty

or see april showers bring flowers to may
i can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder
and everything's beautiful in its own way
words can't describe what i feel inside
when i see the beauty in each coming day
what my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
and everything's beautiful in its own way
when i see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
that uproots the harvest and hurls it away
in the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
the storm's even beautiful in its own way
when i see leaves drop off from the treetop
or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
my thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
god made all things beautiful in their own way
words can't describe what i feel inside
when i see the beauty in each coming day
what my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
and everything's beautiful in its own way, in its own way, in its own way"

writer dolly parton
copyright 1976
the hardest thing i've ever done or that i'll ever do
was to just walk off and leave you but i knew i had to leave you
cause i couldn't stay and watch you falling out of love with me
the worst pain that i've ever known or that i'll ever know
was to see your love a dying and to have to watch it dying
and i couldn't stand to watch you falling out of love with me
it's hurtin' now but still it's better i left while love was still alive
it was dying and i'd rather i didn't have to watch it die
the deepest hurt i've ever felt or that i'll ever feel
was to know that i was losing and i tried but i kept losing
and i couldn't stay to watch you falling out of love with me
the loneliest i've ever been or that i'll ever be
is now that i'm without you and i feel so lost without you
but i couldn't stay and watch you falling out of love with me
i'm crying now but still it's better i left while love was still alive
but it was dying and i'd rather i didn't have to watch it die"

mom wonders why i don't drive back in that big fine car i own
truth is i don't have a car and i'm ashamed to go back home
a pair of false eyelashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
a pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
these are all of my possessions all i have to my name
and the record played in my hometown is my only claim to fame
i'm so glad that dad can't see me now his favorite little girl
singin' in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world

living so wicked year after year

farther along we'll understand why

copyright 1970
fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
there surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
you you to fight and scratch with you
well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
it looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
i figured you'd mention that smart aleck
yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
but no uhhuh i don't reckon that'd count really
fight and scratch fight and scratch...
sometimes i swear i think that you're the devil in disguise
cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
and if you don't like the way i look then you know how to leave bossy catfish
fight and scratch fight and scratch...
well i love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
but the way we fight you wouldn't know that we had any love at all
we just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
for what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch
fight and scratch fight and scratch...
why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and i'll live forever just for spite
why don't you keep your big mouth shot
well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
yeah and i could whip you with both hands tied behind
yeah you just try it with me and i'll knock your brains out
with a stick of soap that's good catfish
what's a catfish why'd you call me that
they're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
it's all i can do to keep from laughin' hah
that's funny you sure are a fynny little fellow"
"you and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
oh yes you did you started it like you start all our fights
no i didn't do no such thing and that a dirty lie
nothin's ever your fault and nothin's ever mine
you and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
well you've burned the supper up again that's nothin' new
i just figured you'd pack that all on me
well you're the one that caused it oh it's always me
when you're always lookin' faults ain't hard to find
we delight in pickin' fights cause our love's the fightin' kind
two lovers both too stubborn to take the blame for anything
so we blame it on the other
some love is understanding and there's careless love in line
it takes all sorts and mine and yours is known as the fightin' kind
okay miss priss what is it now now i know you done this
what how am i supposed to shave that ain't never been my problem
now i don't care about you using my razor
but did you have to use my brand new blade
new blade boy it's good that is really good
that's real good to think i went to all that trouble tryin' to fix that nice for you
that's fixed up nice i'll probably keep it for washin' the soap off the wall
oh there ain't no soap or i ain't got no television in the bathroom
and that new blade that you vedrudged me had already been used
two lovers both too stubborn to take the blame for anything
so we blame it on the other
what's mine is yours what's yours is yours and so on down the line
you and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
you and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind"

well i loved you too but it takes a long time
to know what hurts you what helps you and know how you feel deep inside

all of the magic that you bring along

wrapped as a gift sent from heaven above
i promise i'll always love you
i'm yours, forever, love
you are my joy and my laughter
i vow to drink only from your loving cup
you are my ever after

duet by dolly parton and porter wagoner
writers larry kingston, frank dycus
copyright 1970
i've never had a pair of shoes that weren't all hand me downs
and daddy's morning coffee came from ol' left over ground
my mama wore no jewelry or any store bought stuff
and home was on a hillside forty miles from poplar bluff
forty miles back in missouri there's a different way of life
where a man thinks of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
life is far from fancy sometimes mighty rough
but contentment makes it worth it forty miles from poplar bluff
our only family treasure was a beat up radio
but it took us to the places where we knew we'd never go
we never had much money but we always had enough
cause money never mattered much forty miles from poplar bluff
forty miles back in missouri
well nearly every winter when the snow is on the ground
and the roads would all be closed and we couldn't get to town
but if daddy had his tobacco grandma had her snuff
then the winters didn't seem so long forty miles from poplar bluff
forty miles back in missouri
forty miles from poplar bluff"

don't tell me you're sorry for thing you caused me
and from from now on you'll be true
and don't don't you ask me to forgive you again i'm fresh out of forgiveness
for you

you

do
well you're just too just too wrong and you hurt me hurt me again
and i'm fresh out of forgiveness for you i'm fresh out of forgiveness for you"
"you kindle the fire of love inside me
each time our lips meet
i'm not strong when we're alone
your kisses make me weak
you must know how i feel
but do you feel the same
everytime you kiss me
you add fuel to the flame
my eyes light up when i see you
i burn with desire
each time you're near
you say you'll care
but still i'm not sure
but please don't ask me to love you
if you're not gonna change my name
everytime you touch me
you add fuel to the flame
this fire you started inside me
has reached my very soul
you're adding fuel to a flame
that's already burning out of control
when you give me your name
i give you everything
everytime you kiss me
adds fuel to the flame
yes everytime you touch me
you add fuel to the flame"
"you've seen me naked in more ways than one
you've seen me done up, seen me come undone
we've cried in the darkness, we've laughed in the sun
we've been forever, yet we've just begun
chorus:
we've come full circle, all the way 'round
through the good times, the bad times, through life's ups and downs
still we've stayed together throught thick and through thin
yes, we've come full circle
thank god, we're still friends
you know the soft spots under my skin
deep down inside me, where no one has been
and we've sailed troubled waters, we've soared on the wind
but time's only sweetened this love that we're in
chorus:
and we've come full circle, all the way 'round
throught the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs
still we've stayed together through thick and through thin
yes, we've come full circle
thank god, we're still friends
tag chorus:
we've cried in the darkness, laughed in the sun
we've come full circle and we've just begun
we've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round
we've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round
you know we've cried in the darkness, and we've laughed in the sun
we've stayed together, and we've just begun
fade:
we've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round
i'm so glad you're still my friend
we've come full circle, and i'd do it all again"
"being born was the worse and the first mistake i ever made
the doctor didnæš° spank me, he just slapped me in the face
and the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst
leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt
'cause i was raised an orphan
never wanted as a kid until the year i turned 13
then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth
men just took me as they pleased
and others had a cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep
chorus:
though the deck is stacked against you
win or lose, you have to play
the hand a life has dealt you
and itæš¯ a gamble either way
on a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress
with the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck
and the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time
or should i fear what lay before me less than what i'd left behind
a 15 year old girl donæš° have no trouble hitching rides
but sometimes when you're riding free
youæš£l pay the highest price
on back roads and in back seats
and in a cheap highway motel
but whatæš¯ a few more strangers in a life of nothing else
repeat chorus
16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light
on the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night
when i walked into the parlour here
other pieces seemed to fit
i was good at pleasing strangers
so i made the most of it
either way itæš¯ all a gamble
so view the stakes and know the odds
and lay your cards upon the table
do all the dealing from the top
repeat chorus"
"games people play
writer joe south
oh the games people now every night and every day now
never meanin' what they say now never sayin' what they mean
so they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
la la lotten da da da la la lotten da da dee
i'm talkin' bout you and me and the games people play
oh we make one another cry break the hearts then we say goodbye
cross the hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
thinkin' bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame
la la lotten da da da....
oh they'll teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
and furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
look around tell me what you see what's a happened to you and to me
god grand me the serenity to just remember who i am
la la lotten da da da....
la la lotten da da da...."
"i used to need you, but then i finally learned
i used to want you, but now the tables turned
i used to love you, now it's your time to squirm
i'm saying goodbye and i won't wait for your return.
so get out and stay out, i've finally had enough
don't kiss me on your way out, it wouldn't move me much
you used me, abused me, you cheated and you lied
so get out and stay out, i'm taking back my life
i wonder what you'll do when i am not around
now that your new love has up and let you down
you've always come crying to me throughout the years
to mend another broken heart, to dry your selfish tears.
so get out and stay out, i'm moving on at last
cause, i've been so foolish, but that was in the past.
i never thought i'd be the one to say goodbye
you get out and stay out, i'm taking back my life.
dreams and plans are in the making
i just wish it was as simple as it sounds
life is out there for the taking
now that i'm unfettered and unbound
you get out and stay out, i've finally had enough
don't kiss me on your way out, it wouldn't move me much
you used me, abused me, you cheated and you lied
so get out and stay out, i'm taking back my life
i'm taking back my life
i'm taking back my life
taking it back my life
i'm taking it back
i use to need you
i used to want you
i used to love him but now the tables turned."
"dolly parton   gettin' happy
without a love to call my own my life was incomplete
it seems i couldn't help but think that love was not for me
but my life took on a different twist when i met me a man that i couldn't resist
i didn't know what all i'd missed, and i'm a gettin' happy
oh, i'm a gettin' happy
yeah, i'm a gettin' happy   all my lonely days are gone

"i wish i could forget you, but i won't
i wish i loved another, but i don't
it's just the same, day after day
your memory keeps getting in my way
but i'm hoping i will be alright
but i don't even sleep at night
i close my eyes i see your face
your memory keeps getting in my way
bridge:
i don't know why i can't forget you
i don't see why i should let you
keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday
your memory keeps getting in my way
it's easy for someone to lie
i'm saying i'll forget you and i'll try
here's hoping that i will someday
your memory keeps getting in my way

"popcorn, soda, box of raisinets
velvet cushioned seats and soft armrests
best seat in my favorite movie house
start my dreaming as the lights go out
up on the silver screen, i picture me
living out my passions, hopes, and fantasies
i want to be the girl in the movies
the one with the glint in her eyes
the girl that seldom loses
beautiful, with grace and style
acting out her story
standing in her glory
happy ever after
i want to be the girl in the movies
wish i had a nickel for each dime i've spent
watching others live their lives with confidence
here's a preview of some things to come
it's not too late for me to be someone
i can't keep living in their make believe
coming attractions will be starring me
i want to be the girl in the movies
the one with the stars in her eyes she gets the roles she chooses
she can laugh or she can cry
acting in her story
standing in her glory
always happy endings
i want to be the girl in the movies
it's time i show the world just what i'm about
i'm steppin' up and i'm steppin' out
i'm feelin' bold and i'm feelin' proud
i want to be that girl
i want to be the girl in the movies
hmm hmm
i want to be the girl in the movies
hmm hmm hmm
gonna stand up
and i'm gonna matter
'cause i've had enough of my dreams being shattered
and i've had enough of my tears being splattered
i've already been that girl
oh, i want to be i want to be i want to be the girl in the movies
i want to be hey look at me i want to be the girl in the movies
i want to shine i want to shine it's my time

"sometimes in my sleep i hold you close against my skin
wakin?up i wish that i could sleep and dream again

"today as i was walking
in the fields just down the way
i sat down on a fallen log
to pass the time away
and as i looked around me
the more that i did look
the more i realize that i am viewing
god's coloring book
i saw a golden ray of sunlight
a silver drop of dew
a soft, white floating cloud
sailing cross the sky 'a blue
a yellow dandelion
pretty evergreen
and some red and orange flowers
growing wild along the stream
and the more i look around me
and the more that i do look
the more i realize that i am viewing
god's coloring book
the greyness in an old man's hair
the pink in baby's cheeks
the blackness in a stormy sky
the brown in fallen leaves
and the multicolored rainbow
stretched out across the sky
and the purple haze at sunset
just before the night
and the more i look around me
and the more that i do look
the more i realize that i am viewing
god's coloring book
then i turn my face toward the sky
and say a silent prayer
though god doesn't speak to me
i see him everywhere
he is all around me
he's everywhere i look
and each new day is but a new page
in god's coloring book

"glory to his name, oh, holy, holy
there's a city where the streets are paved in gold
a land where the milk and the honey flow
and a mansion which for me
'cause my bible tells the story
i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
green meadows where the little children play
no sorrow there, just one long happy day
and none will litter there except the pure and the holy
i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
and when i've reached my journey's end
and if i'm worthy to go in
golden streets of glory, i walk on
and the golden streets of my new home
will lead me up to the master's throne
with the angel band i'll sing
glory to his name, oh, holy, holy
i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
hallelujah, i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
and when i've reached my journey's end
and if i'm worthy to go in
golden streets of glory, i'll walk on
and the golden streets of my new home
will lead me up to the master's throne
with the angel band i'll sing
glory to his name, oh, holy, holy
i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory
hallelujah, i just hope my feet are clean enough
to walk upon the golden streets of glory"
"good understanding
duet by dolly parton and porter wagoner
writer dolly parton
copyright 1970
when we married we agreed that we'd both do as we please
just as long as we done each other right
through the years our love has grown now our love is twice as strong
cause we've got a good understanding
yes we've got a good understanding and a love that has never been demanding
we both love each other so and that's all we need to know
cause we've got a good understanding
it's been your unselfish love that has always helped me up
when temptation reached out its hand to see
and when i could have gone wrong i would think of you at home
and i'd think about our good understanding
yes we've got a good understanding..."
"i've had to think up a way to survive
since you said it's over told me goodbye
i just can't make it one day without you
unless i pretend that the opposite's true
rivers flow backwards valleys are high
mountains are level truth is a lie
i'm perfectly fine and i don't miss you
the sky is green and the grass is blue
how much can a heart and a troubled mind take
where is that fine line before it all breaks
can one end their sorrow just cross over it
and into that realm of insanitive bliss
there's snow in the tropics there's ice on the sun
it's hot in the arctic and crying is fun
and i'm happy now and i'm glad we're through
and the sky is green and the grass is blue
and the rivers flow backwards and my tears are dry
swans hate the water and eagles can't fly
but i'm alright now now that i'm over you
and the sky is green and the grass is blue
and i don't love you and the grass is blue"
"you shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
too much love can drive a girl insane
you broke my will oh but what a thrill
goodness gracious great balls of fire
i like that love cause i thought it was funny
you came along and you move me honey
i change my mind this love is sure fine
goodness gracious great balls of fire
chorus:
ooh kiss me baby, ooh it feels good
ooh hold me, hold me, i would love to love you
like a lover should
'cause you're fine, and so kind
i tell the world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine
i chew my nails and i twiddle my thumbs
i'm real nervous but it sure is fun
you broke my will but i love you still and
goodness gracious great balls of fire
goodness gracious great balls of fire
ooh kiss my baby, ooh it feels good, ooh hold me
baby, you ought to love me like a lover should
'cause you're fine, and so kind
i tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

"dawn is slowly breaking our friends have all gone home
you and i are waiting for santa claus to come
there's a present by the tree stockings on the wall
knowing you're in love with me is the greatest gift of all
the fire is slowly fading chill is in the air
all the gifts are waiting for children everywhere
through the window i can see snow begin to fall
knowing you're in love with me is the greatest gift of all
just before i go to sleep i hear a church bell ring
merry christmas everyone is the song it sings
so i play a silent prayer for creatures great and small
peace on earth good will to men is the greatest gift of all
peace on earth good will to men is the greatest gift of all"
"i flew off to the wild blue yonder
'cause i had a dream
and i had to go
but i'm filled with a sense of wonder
from the love i shared
with a green eyed boy
lips as sweet as mountain honey
a body warm as home made wine
but he had no dreams
and no means for money
but he had me just anytime
chorus:
take me back, if just in memory
fill my cup again with joy
the fire still burns in the old rock chimney
and i still burn for that green eyed boy
now he was pretty
with chiseled features
like the movie stars in the magazines
my first love and the son of a preacher
i fantasized me was james dean
but the world outside kept pulling at me
offered me fame, respect, and gold
designer clothes and a fancy mansion
expensive cars, so i chose those
repeat chorus twice
ooh, ooh, how i love that green eyed boy
ooh, ooh, ooh, and i still miss
that green eyed boy
fade:
do you think about me
when the nights are long and cold
do you ever miss me
do you my green eyed boy"
"we might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank
we fed ourselves from the fruit of the land
and quenched our thirst with rain
we never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet
life just had no pattern for gypsy joe and me
all we had was each other and the rags upon our back
the closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack
but we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need
life was free and simple for gypsy joe and me
now gypsy was my little dog, i found by the road in a ditch
and so i named him gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit
oh and joe he was my man, the flower of my soul
thou he never said he loved me, i just always seemed to know
while standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride
the speeding wheels of a passing car, took gypsy's life
i lost him where i found him and his loss was misery
now there's no more gypsy, there's just joe and me
well the winter came and the snow did fall
and the night was cold and still
and the rags we wore were not enough
and joe he caught the chill
and he told me how he loved me
and in my arms he went to sleep
now there's no more gypsy, no more joe, there's just me
while standin' here on the edge of this bridge
lookin' down i see
the face of joe and gypsy, lookin' back at me
and somewhere in the distance i can hear them callin' me
tonight we'll be together again
gypsy, joe and me"

although you're with somebody new
thought i'd drop a line to say
that i wish this happy day
would find me beside you
happy, happy birthday baby
no, i can't call you my baby
seems like years ago we met
on a day i can't forget
cause that's when we fell in love

"i want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
and she said, ""mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta""
well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
it's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way""
and it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta
well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
and boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
and as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
she said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
and mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
and mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
and shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
and if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
and then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrits
now i wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
that day my mama socked it to the harper valley pta
that day my mama socked it to 'em at the harper valley pta"

he left me love enough to last a lifetime a lifetime filled with loving memories
and so i have no reason to search for new love time could never take his love
from me
and my mind is filled with mem'ries sweet and tender
my heart is filled with love he left for me
and each thought of him just makes the love grow sweeter
he left me love to last eternally
i just close my eyes and i still see him
and in dreams he loves me just like he used to do
even wakes me with a tender kiss every morning
a kiss that lingers on my lips the whole day through
and my mind is filled...
oh yes he left me love"
"a light shines from my window
i just can't sleep no more
lord, it hurts so much to be alone
but the real men never do admit
that it's them that might be wrong
at least that's what he told me in his song
chorus:
he rode all the way to texas
on an old freight train
didn't miss the girl he left behind
he rode all the way to texas
didn't shed a tear
he's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
the freedom that he sings about
i guess i'll never know
i just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
but he lets me ride when the lights turns low
get on board the radio and take a ride to texas on his train

in my mind i've made love to you often but only in my mind can it be so
cause there's someone at home that's countin' on me
and if i did i'm sure that he would know
yes he would know yes he could tell
for he has loved me long enough to know me very well
and if i lie he sees it in my eyes i know my guilt would show and he would know
but i must admit you're someone very special and it would be so easy to let go
making love to you could be so easy but if i did i'm sure that he would know
yes he would know...
my conscience just won't let me make love to you
i know it would be sweet but i just can't
when i go home to him i must be able to look him in the eyes and say i ain't
cause he would know..."
"he's a go getter, go getter
when his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her
now i've got a neighbor that lives down the road a ways
his wife holds down a steady job, he don't turn his hand all day
i know that most of you will know the kind i'm talkin' about
the kind that rather than have to work, he'd rather do without
but he's a go getter, a go getter
when his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her
there's a group of men in the court house yard any time that you go by
playin' checkers and tradin' odds and makin' jokes about their wives
they wait all week for pay day and they hold the money's plenty
and the wife that's worked those long hard hours never gets a penny
but he's a go getter, a go getter
when his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her
yes he's a go getter, a go getter
when his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her
he's a go getter, a go getter
when his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her"
"the gates and doors were barred
and all the windows fastened down
i spent the night in sleeplessness
and rose at every sound
half in hope of sorrow
and half in fear the day
would find the soldiers breakin' through
to drag us all away
and just before the sunrise
i heard something at the wall
the gate began to rattle
and a voice began to call
i hurried to the window
looked down into the street
expecting swords and torches
and the sound of soldiers' feet
but there was no one there but mary
so i went down to let her in
john stood there beside me
as she told me where she'd been
she said they've moved him in the night
and none of us know where
the stone's been rolled away
and now his body isn't there
we both ran towards the garden
then john ran on ahead
we found the stone and empty tomb
just the way that mary said
but the winding sheet they wrapped him in
was just an empty shell
and how or where they'd taken him
was more than i could tell
oh something strange had happened there
just what i did not know
john believed a miracle
but i just turned to go
circumstance and speculation
couldn't lift me very high
'cause i'd seen them crucify him
then i saw him die
back inside the house again
the guilt and anguish came
everything i'd promised him
just added to my shame
when at last it came to choices
i denied i knew his name
and even if he was alive
it wouldn't be the same
but suddenly the air was filled
with a strange and sweet perfume
light that came from everywhere
drove shadows from the room
and jesus stood before me
with his arms held open wide
and i fell down on my knees
and i just clung to him and cried
then he raised me to my feet
and as i looked into his eyes
the love was shining out from him
like sunlight from the skies
guilt in my confusion
disappeared in sweet release
and every fear i ever had
just melted into peace
he's alive yes he's alive
yes he's alive and i'm forgiven
heaven's gates are open wide
he's alive yes he's alive
oh he's alive and i'm forgiven
heaven's gates are open wide
he's alive he's alive
hallelujah he's alive
he's alive and i'm forgiven
heaven's gates are open wide
he's alive he's alive he's alive
i believe it he's alive
sweet jesus"
"he's everywhere

copyright 1972
he walks in my mind like the shadow someone speaks his name and he appears
i can see his face in total darkness oh he's everywhere
he left a mem'ry that lives with me a mem'ry of how it used to be
and i remember all the things we used to share oh he's everywhere
he waits in the corners of my mind and in the stillness of the night he walks
around
sometimes the memory's so real i think he's really there oh he's everywhere
he left a mem'ry that lives with me...
oh he's everywhere"

my heart begins to race

"packin' my suitcase writin' a tear stained good bye note
sayin' so long to a love gone wrong and that's all she wrote
leavin' behind what once was mine with sad regrets
but it's all gone now and i'm leavin' town on the heartbreak express
walkin in the rain with a heart full of pain to the train depot
the only things that's gonna keep me warm now is my overcoat
lost and lonely waitin in line at the ticket desk
hey mister won't you give me a one way ticket on the heartbreak express
i'm gonna roll on down the line
i'm gonna go so far i'm gonna get it off my mind
it hurts to know it ain't enough when you give your best
got a ticket to ride and i'm leavin tonight on the heartbreak express
oh i couldn't hold a candle to a flaming beauty that caught his eye
it's killin' me now but i won't stay around and let him watch me die
oh it just goes to show you never do know 'cause i never would'a guessed
i'd be sittin' here now on a train sorrow bound called the heartbreak express
i'm gonna roll on down the line
i'm gonna go so far i'm gonna get it off mt mind
maybe someday somewhere someway i will forget
but there's no goin' back so roll down the track you ole heartbreak express
feelin' alone while a low whistle moans
on the heartbreak express"
"here i sit all alone, thinkin' 'bout what i should have known
you made me think that i could need you
you weaved your magic spell and i believed you
lookin back on you and me, promises that will never be
i truly thought we were lovers
but now i find that i'm just like all the others
heartbreaker, wish that i had seen that love was blind
sweet little love maker, takin my heart and leave me behind
heartbreaker couldn't you be
just a little more kind to me
played with fire, felt its burn
i would have thought that i would have learned
i melted every time you kissed me
every time you'd leave i thought that you would miss me
heartbreaker, wish that i had seen that love was blind
sweet little love maker, takin' my heart and leave me behind
heartbreaker couldn't you be
just a little more kind to me"
"chorus:
a heartsong melody play like a symphony
the sweetest music i have ever known
a song of joy and pain
the mountain angels sing
a bittersweet refreign of my smokey mountain home, heartsong
farmer's daughter if you will
and i often wonder still
in memories where i rammbled as a child
makes me cry and makes me laugh
my reflections on the past
and the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life
ragged clothes and hand me downs
just enough to go around
but the sweetest things in life are always free
like the songs the birds would sing
and the sweet new grass of spring
and the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree
repeat chorus
and i recall the thrill and joy
of a smokey mountain boy
i remember my first kiss and my first love
and the songs i'd song and write
and the dreams i'd clutch so tight
and the loved ones that gave me that extra shove
and in that little house 'a prayer
where i spent many hour
prassin' god and liftin' up his name
and asking him to lead and to keep watch over me
as i headed up that rocky road to fame
and now this, smokey mountain girl has been all around the world
but it makes no difference just how far i roam
i still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart
my faith in god and memories of home

you talk to jesus, you talk to him every day.

and give your heart and your soul to jesus.
heaven's just a prayer away.
you are just one prayer from heaven
as you travel down life's highway.
just when you think that you can't make it,
well, heaven's just a prayer away.

you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and give your soul to jesus.

he is there with the answers
let us lift him up
god loves you, did you know that?
ain't it good to know he cares
if you're burdened down with troubles
just go to him in prayer
say god, i'm just a seeker
i'm empty, scared and lost
then lay your burdens down
at the foot of the cross

and the truth shall set you free
he will guide and lead you
and fulfill every need
nothing is impossible

now little will was from the hills a way back in the styx
he got his reputation from turning on them country chicks
he drove a super hot rod car but he he could really
knock those little girls off their feet yeah hillbilly willy
he'd talk that ol' sweet lovers talk with a hillbilly drawl
willy wasn't much for looks he was only five feet tall
when he talked that ol' sweet talk he drove those little girls silly
they stood in line waitin' for their time to court hillbilly willy
then this country cyclop who measured six foot nine
came up to little will and said then there was an awful brawl boy it was a dilly
when the fighting stopped there on top stood hillbilly willy
now the moral of this story is to be a lover you got to be tough
even if you're just five feet tall you got to be able to strut your stuff
now to all you lovers in radio land if your lovelife's a little chilly

you mold them and shape them and then throw them down
all of your glitter and all of your gold
is that what you give in exchange for a soul
cause they sell their soles for the likes of you
while you chew up and spit out what you cannot use

"looking out at my window pane
tears lingering with the rain
i'm so lonesome, i could cry
just like old hank
staring down on the city street
feeling empty and incomplete
there's a place i need to be
to feel my day
a place i can go
where i can be free
where i can be happy and
just be me
home, where the long wind's blowin'
and the river's is flowing
run along, like a lazy bum in
the midnight summer night
run along, fishing with a friend
and a fishing hope
rocking, lay down my heavy load
know that i am always welcomed home
i left home, i was 17
i had a lot of ambitious dreams
seen a lot of those dreams come true
i had good luck
i ain't complaining, that's for sure
i got a lot to be thankful of
one of those things is a magic door
that opens up
back to the time when i was a kid
with the sounds of a cricket and
home, where the long wind's blowin'
and the river's is flowing
run along, like a lazy bum in
the midnight summer night
run along, fishing with a friend
and a fishing hope
rocking, lay down my heavy load
know that i am always welcomed home"
"i became a woman of the world cause i was fed up with the farm
and i thought pretty clothes and city lights
running round both day and night could do no harm
a party girl i mixed for bout myself into a fix for running wild
so i wrote my dad and mom asked if i could come back home to have my child
i received the letter from the folks back home and they said things were fine
they went on to say that pete the boy i broke up with was about to lose his mind
but i couldn't hardly read the rest the words were being bloted by my tears
i'm feelin' so ashamed he loved me then he feels the same he still cares
so i'm going home for pete's sake it was i who broke his heart in the first place
if he'll try me one more time for then i've made up my mind
and in the morning i'm going home for pete's sake
yes for pete's sake my baby's and mine"
"home is where the hurt is
writers marge barton, johnny mcrae
copyright 1965
we're well known in every honky tonk in town
not a night goes by that we don't make the rounds
people wonder why we choose to live this way
why don't they ever stay at home i hear them say
but home is where the hurt is cause love doesn't live there anymore
home is where the hurt is that's why we don't stay at home much anymore
what was once our happy home has come to be
a place to fuss and fight and disagree
our lonely house with wall to all regret
and these bright lights somehow help us to forget
cause home is where the hurt is...
that's why we don't stay at home much anymore"
"bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink
just keep it coming till i don't have to think
and point out some cowboy that might want to dance
and make sure i get home if you see that i can't
you see i loved him, he left me for a girl half my age
i relate to each sad song that ole jukebox has played
i listen to haggard, ole hank, and george jones
but why don't more women sing honky tonk songs?
chorus:
why don't more women sing honky tonk songs?
about the heartaches and the tough breaks
and the men that's done 'em wrong
there are others just like me that are hurtin' to the bone
so why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
honky tonk angels are just queens without thrones
judge not lest you be judged, who can cast the first stone
why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
repeat 1st verse
why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
about the heartaches and the tough breaks
and all the men that's done us wrong
there's a whole lotta women i know would sing along
so why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
why don't more women sing honky tonk songs"
"a squeaky gate a welcome lock a big shaggy dog that lives out back
and some might even call it a shack but this is the house where love lives
the paint is peelin' off of the cells the mailbox is full of bills
and it's no mansion on the hill but this is the house where love lives
there's a little boy who looks just you with freckles on his nose and eyes of blue
a little girl almost two and everybody says she looks just like you
so thank you dear for loving me though i know rich we'll never be
but that doesn't matter to you and me cause we live in the house where love lives
so thank you dear for loving me though i know rich we'll never be
but that doesn't matter to you and me cause we live in the house where love lives
we live in the house where love lives"
"how close they must be
duet by dolly parton and porter wagoner
writer porter wagoner)
copyright 1973
on a park bench on sunny afternoon sat a young boy and a girl bout seventeen
as we stood so closely by watched them hold each other's hand
on their faces love had written we're making plans
then he said to her you're my guiding light
then she said to him you make my whole world seem so bright
then we saw their books of braille and that neither one could see
then i thought how close they must be
such tenderness my eyes have never seen two young lovers both just in their
teens
though their world gives them no light they see more than you and me
don't you know how close they must be
then a car stopped just a few steps away
and a voice said jim and jeannie it's time to go
with their hands still clutched so tight helping each other to the car
can you imagine just how close they are
don't you know how close they must be"
"i know that you're out there
knowing that there's someone out here thinkin' of you
in your heart and in your mind
i know there is no doubt that someone loves you
and i know that you know
that i'll be waiting here when you have need of me
and when the world has chained you down
i know you know my love will set you free
how does it feel to know that someone loves you
how does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you
oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you
how does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you
i have come to know and love you
like i've never known or loved another
words have not been made
that could describe these feelings we have for each other
and i would go to any length
to let you know at all times that i care
'cause i want you to know
that any time you reach for me you'll find me there
how does it feel to know that someone loves you
how does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you
oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you
how does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you
someone loves you, how does it feel to know it
someone loves you, how does it feel to know that someone
loves you, someone loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel
how does it feel to know that someone loves you
somebody loves you, how does it feel, how does it feel
how does it feel to know that someone loves you
someone loves you, somebody loves you
somebody loves you, how does it feel to know it
somebody loves you"

oh lord my god when i in awesome wonder
consider all the worlds thy hands have made
now i see the stars and i hear the rolling thunder
thy art throughout the universe displayed
then sings my soul my saviour god to thee how great thou art oh how great thou
art
then sings my soul my saviour god to thee how great thou art how great thou art
when christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
to take me home what joy shall fill my heart
then i shall kneel in humble adoration and there proclaim my god how great thou
art
then sings my soul..."
"the thrill, the desire, the excitement is gone
we seem to have found a safe comfort zone
we worked so hard to get where we are
that romance got lost on the way
it used to be never enough
we'd melt with each look and each burning touch
we laughed and we loved and we just ate it up
back when we were hungry that way
chorus:
let's love like we're hungry again
bring back the passion we had back then
the time has gone by, we forgot what it meant
lets love like we're hungry again
don't you miss those feelings we had at the start
and that fire that got started from each little spark
oh it's good where we are, but i miss where we've been
lets love like we're hungry again, now and then
lets love like we're hungry again
bring back the passion we had back then
the time has gone by, now we've grown too content
lets love like we're hungry again, now and then
lets love like we're hungry again"
"many years you have lingered around my cabin door
oh hard times come again no more
oh hard times come again no more
oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away
cause my hungry baby wants a gingerbread cake
not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend
not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen
chorus:
so, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
your mama can't give you what you're crying for
there's a wolf at the door with an angry
cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
and the cupboard is bare
oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest
cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress
and she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear
and she wants some silver bows for her golden hair
repeat chorus twice
hush a bye hard times go ye away
i don't intend to be treated this way
so, hush a bye baby
hush a bye hard times
hush a bye baby
don't cry no more
hush a bye hard times
hush a bye baby
hush a bye hard times
come ye no more
fade:
many years you have lingered around my cabin door
hush a bye hard times
come ye no more

hush a bye hard times
hush a bye baby
don't cry no more
hush a bye hard times
hush a bye baby

so don't expect it of me though i expect it of you

and i've fallen victim to many a smile

as i prayed for time to fly
i lived on hopes that you'd return
and that's how i got by
the agony of loneliness
just got too much for me
i couldn't wait forever
needing love so desperately
so i found new lips to kiss me
new arms to hold me tight
i found new love and happiness
to fill these empty nights
you took my love for granted
now my heart has found a new home

i went to bed so sad and blue

underneath the harvest moon
i was thinkin' about you
and then you met me in the moonlight
the stars were shining in your eyes
but another was there too
i don't believe you've met my baby
you looked at her, you looked at me
i wondered who you were talkin' to
i shook the hand of your stranger
but i was shaking more inside
cause i was still wonderin' who
your arm was restin' on her shoulder
you smiled at her, she smiled at you
her eyes were filled with victory
she said my brother wants to marry
and then my heart was filled with ease
i knew that you would marry me
oh, i don't believe you've met my baby
you looked at her, you looked at me
i knew that you would marry me

"you're not gonna believe what i saw
i saw mommy kissing santa claus
underneath the mistletoe last night
she didn't hear me creep
down the stairs to have a peep
she thought that i was tucked up
in my bedroom fast asleep
then, i saw mommy tickle santa claus
underneath his beard, so snowy white
oh, what a laugh it would have been
if daddy had only seen
mommy kissing santa claus last night
i saw it with my own two eyes
not only were they kissin'
they were drinking milk and eating cookies together
now i know how to keep a secret
'cause i wanna stay on santa's good side
you don't just tell everything you know, mhm
i saw mommy kissing santa claus
underneath the mistletoe last night

today i started loving you again
i'm right back where i've really always been
i got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
and then today i started loving you again
what a fool i was to think i could get by
with only these few million tears i've cried
i guess i should have known the worst was yet to come
and the crying time for me had just begun

"nothing new, nothing different, nothing better, nothing more
nothing else to give you i didn't give before
i gave my love completely, my heart was always yours
it wouldn't do, i still lost you
you want to give it one chance; don't know why we should
we'd never get that far again or make the love that good
we had our chance, we blew it; and i'll never understand
careless fools, i still lost you
you want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire
conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires
what we had then, we don't have now; and i would just compare
i refuse, i still lost you
too late for starting over, it hardly ever works
too many missing pieces, too much water, too much hurt
i already lost you once, and that makes matters worse
what's the use, i still lost you
oh you want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire
conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires
what we had then, we don't have now; and i would just compare
i refuse, i still lost you
oh what's the use, i still lost you
i lost you"

i would've treated him so differently
and if i, if i had known
well then i
i could've shown him more love
than he'll ever see from her

yes i admit it, i am a fool for you
because you're mine i walk the line

and happiness i've known proves that it's right

no sorrow, no pain, only sunshine, no rain

i wanna go back there, i wanna go back there

and see if we might make it back

i believe it could still be like that

begging for nickels and dimes on the street and i just didn't understand

in the mill pond after midnight in our birthday suit
makin' sweet, sweet love
meet the stars above
sneakin' back in through the window
'fore the clock strikes two, yeah
i'm sixteen, burstin' at the seams
i'm back in my jeans
and i feel no pain
kickin' up my heels
haven't had such thrills
since drivin' my old chevy down lovers' lane

"i'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
writer a.p. carter
'twould been better for us both had we never
in this wide and wicked world had never met,
for the pleasure we've both seen together
i'm sure, love, i'll never forget.
oh, i'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
who is sailing far over the sea.
i'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
and i wonder if he ever thinks of me.
oh, you told me once, dear, that you loved me;
you said that that we never would part.
but a link in the chain has been broken
leaves me with a sad and aching heart.
when the cold, cold grave shall enclose me
will you come dear and shed just one tear
and say to the strangers around you
a poor heart you have broken lies here"

there's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
the love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
there's nothing left to loose ends on all the ties that bind
i'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
there's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
when we might find happiness with somebody else
there's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
i'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
the blame belongs to both of us i guess we didn't try
love is like a garden that wilts if it's left to die
the flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
i'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
i'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
you're wasting mine you're wasting mine"

last night you went out again with what you said was your best friend
you say you need some time away from me
the sun was high when you got in but not as high as you had been
and i wonder how you would act if i done just the way i pleased
i've been married just as long as you have
and i get tired of the same old things just the same as you have
well let me tell you this big boy when you go out for a night of joy
you better start taking me along or you'll be singing a different song
for i've been married just as long as you have
while i'm working hard all day you run around and spend my pay
you entertain your friends at my expence
but you cry and carry on when i do something on my own
and you accuse with lack of evidence
i've been married just as long as you have
and i get tired of the same old things just the same as you have
so let me tell you this sweetheart i figure i've done my part
so don't get cute and get so smart i'll tell you this before you start
i've been married just as long as you have and that's a pretty good while
i know you have you ain't spent no time at home
you're running around all over town you're here and there everywhere
you move so fast a umbrella'd be in your way honey if it was raining
(oh boy now ain't that cute if your heart was as big as your mouth
you'd give everything we owned away) but i love you you little devil
so don't you ever take off and leave me now here by myself
i'll hit you right in the i'll hit you right in the mouth honey and it'll go ah but then you'll look you've had the mumps when i get done kissing you

i'm lookin' for a way to get out there's no hope for you and me
we'll never get along everything we do is wrong
you and i both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
we stopped loving a long time ago and now all we do is disagree
there's no use to pretend there's no need to try again
you and i both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
there's no use for us to live a lie
when we're just wasting the best years of our lives
we'll never get along everything we do is wrong
you and i both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me

"just like the tide goes with the sea
we belong together, you and me

we'll always be together

chorus:
it must be you that's always walking in my dreams
it must be you who'll always be right next to me
so when you find yourself alone
just think of me and i'll be there
must be you by my side the whole way through
just like the fresh white winter snow
our love is pure and it will always grow
and when we're in those autumn years
together, we'll look back, but we won't shed a single tear

"as i sit here tonight, the juke box playing
the tune about the wild side of life
as i listen to the words that you are saying
it brings memories of when i was a trusting wife
it wasn't god who made honky tonk angels
as you said in the words of your song
too many times married men think they're still single
that has caused many a good girl to go wrong
break
it's a shame that all the blame is on us women
it's not true that only you men feel the same
from the start most every heart that's ever broken
was because there always was a man to blame"
"hello, are you free tonight
i like your looks, i love your smile
could i use you for a while
it's all wrong, but it's all right

it's all wrong, but it's all right
just close your eyes and hold me tight

could this really be my outlaw lover jj sneed
could a woman with a painted face and pretty sweet disguise
turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes
jj it's been you and me right from the very start
and ever job we ever pulled i'd always done my part
we'd really stick together until the bitter end
and it was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends
a whole lot more than friends
and it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold
but i guess i didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes
but you said it didn't matter cause you love me that a way
you said that no one else could ever steal your heart away steal your heart away
do you recall the union bank we robbed in franklin town
and as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down
and i doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit
but now you have betrayed me is that the thanks i get is that the thanks i get
oh yeah jj i'm thinking now of how we'd all begun
of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trust wordy gun
why we stood off a fuss it was jj just you and i
but now you have betrayed me and for that you're gonna die
yeah for that you're gonna die
the good old days are over as we stand here in the rain
jj i'm gonna shoot you now i hope you'll feel no pain

imagines things that never are

like a frantic frightened child
any time that we're apart
i can't control my jealous heart

"her two little feet would come running into
our bedroom almost every night
her soft little face would be wet from her tears
and her little heart pounding with fright
she'd hold out her arms, then she'd climb in beside us
in her small voice, we'd hear her remark
""mommie and daddy, can i sleep here with you
'cause jeannie's afraid of the dark""
one day in the summer, we took some flowers
to place on some old family graves
jeannie said, ""mommy, ain't it dark in the ground
oh, daddy, i'd be so afraid""
then she looked up at her daddy and me
and said somethin' that broke both our hearts
she said, ""when i die, please don't bury me
'cause jeannie's afraid of the dark""
jeannie was always afraid of the dark
and we never could understand why
'cause we looked after jeannie with the very best of care
because jeannie was our only child
perhaps it was death that she was so afraid of
'cause it took her one dark stormy night
i think we always knew that we'd never see jeannie grown
'cause it seemed she was destined to die
but on jeannie's grave, we placed an eternal flame
that glows and never loses its spark
and on the darkest night, there's always a light
'cause jeannie's afraid of the dark
our jeannie's afraid of the dark"

somethin' holdin' me down.
somethin' to give me wings and keep my feet on the ground.

john daniel came to town one summer afternoon
wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
he was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
and he was, but there was somethin' different in john daniel's eyes
john daniel was a young man, not more than twenty four
and there was an air about him that one could not ignore
and in spite of callused hands & dirty clothes, his face was kind
and i wanted so to know what was in john daniel's mind
john daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
john daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
john daniel, there's somethin' about you that i don't quite understand
john daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
i rented him a room; he went upstairs like all the rest
it was saturday and he'd be goin' in to town, i guessed
but he left in a robe and sandals, with a bible in his hand;
and i thought to myself, john daniel, i don't understand
now i'd planned to meet some friends of mine when i got off at three,
in the park we often gather to talk of love and peace
when i got there i found that a crowd had gathered 'round;
and there i saw john daniel a sittin' on the ground
john daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
john daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
john daniel, there's somethin' about you that i don't quite understand
john daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
so, ""you want to be free,"" he said, ""well, this is how you can.""
as he read from the bible he held in his hand
we were searchin' for the truth not knowin' where to look,
not knowin' that the answers all were in john daniel's book
john daniel told us all how we could be free
john daniel taught us all a better way for you and me
he came to us in our own way so we'd be sure to see
he had the light and essence of the man from galilee
john daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
john daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
john daniel, there's something about you that i don't quite understand
john daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
john daniel, john daniel, john daniel
john daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
john daniel came to town one summer afternoon
wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
he was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
and he was, but there was somethin' different in john daniel's eyes
ooh, john daniel, tell me where did you come from
tell me where is it you've been
john daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
john daniel, there's something about you that i don't quite understand
john daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?"
"well a good ways down the railroad track
there was this little old rundown shack
and in it lived a man i'd never seen
folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
and you better not set foot on his land
i didn't think nobody could be that mean
so i took me out walking down the railroad track
i was a gonna go down to that little old shack
and just find out if all them things i'd heard was true
there was a big black dog laying out in the yard
and it growled at me and i swallowed hard
and i heard somebody say well who are you
oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
his beard and his hair was long and black
and he was the biggest man i'd ever seen
when he spoke his voice was low and deep
but he just didn't frighten me
'cause somehow i just knew he wasn't mean
he said what you doing snooping 'round my place
and i saw a smile come across his face
so i smiled back and i told him who i was
he said come on in and pull you up a chair
you might as well since you already here
and he said you can call me joshua
joshua joshua
whatcha doing living here all alone
joshua joshua
ain't you got nobody to call your own
no no no no
we talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
and we still talking when it come daylight
and there was just so much we had to say hey
i'd spent my life in an orphan's home
and just like him i was all alone
so i said yeah when he asked if i'd stay
oh we grew closer as time went on
and that little old shack it was a happy home
and we just couldn't help but fall in love
that big black dog and that little old shack
sitting down by the railroad track
it's plenty good enough for me and joshua

let earth receive her king;
let every heart prepare him room,

joy to the earth! the savior reigns;
let men their songs employ;
while fields and floods,
rocks, hills and plains
repeat the sounding joy,
repeat the sounding joy,
repeat, repeat the sounding joy.
no more let sins and sorrows grow,
nor thorns infest the ground;
he comes to make his blessing flow
far as the curse is found,
far as the curse is found,
far as, far as the curse is found.
he rules the world with truth and grace,
and makes the nations prove
the glories of his righteousness,

by the way you look at me

just because i'm a woman
so when you look at me
don't feel sorry for yourself
just think of all the shame
you might have brought somebody else
just let me tell you this
then we'll both know where we stand
my mistakes are no worse than yours
just because i'm a woman
now a man will take a good girl
and he'll ruin her reputation
but when he wants to marry
well, that's a different situation
he'll just walk off and leave her
to do the best she can
while he looks for an angel
to wear his wedding band
now i know that i'm no angel
if that's what you thought you'd found
i was just the victum of
a man that let me down
yes, i've made my mistakes
but listen and understand
my mistakes are no worse than yours
just because i'm a woman

if there ever was a perfect love when i look at you i see one
if there's heaven on earth, then this must surely be

the last thing i remember before i go to sleep
is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
and i go to sleep athinking how happy you make me
and i want you to be the last one to touch me
and when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
if i know that you have touched me, then i can sleep in peace
and i want you to be the last one to touch me
and when the night is over and time will be no more
they say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
and so when i awaken from my eternal sleep
i want you to be the first one to touch me
i want you to be the first, the last, the only one to touch me"

in the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand
are you going away with no word of farewell will there be not a trace left behind
i could've loved you better didn't mean to be unkind
you know that was the last thing on my mind
as i walk alone my thoughts're tumbling round and round round and round
underneath our feet a subway's rumbling underground underground
are you going away...
i got reasons of plenty for goingthis i know this i know
the weeds have been steadily growingplease don't go please don't go
are you going away...
are you going away...
you know that was the last thing on my mind"

"love can grow in the strangest places,
might find love in strangers faces.
waiting just around the corner for all you know.
love can grow where you least expect it,
take and chance and don't reject it.
love will grow if one just lets it,
let love grow.
i know you, have feelings for me too
but you're afraid to try to love again.
i know your heart is true
but this is all so new.
i wonder what i'll do,
if i would let you in.
it's a chance that's worth the taking.
love is always out there for the making.
find it in the eyes of someone that you know.
in any color, shape or fashion
there is no denying passion.
love is always everlasting,
let love grow.
yeah
love can fill the empty spaces,
dry our tears and all their traces,
mend our broken hearts and heal our souls.
hindsights always out to blind you.
look ahead
and not behind you.
look for love and let it find you,
let love grow..
love will grow if one just lets it,
let love grow.
let love grow..."

"an old man was sitting at his table one day
writing a letter to pass time away
his little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
saying won't you please write a letter for me
oh what must i say in this letter i pray
tell mommy i miss her since she went away
i'm coming to see her real soon i hope
he choked back a big lump that rose in his throat
he sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
to god up in heaven you'll get it i hope
he stamped it and handed it to her to mail
her big eyes were shining her little face pale
she was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
and when she stepped out never looked either way
a big auto hit her and sped away fast
the little girl's prayers had been answered at last
the postman was passing and picked up the note
addressed to the master and these words he spoke
straight up into heaven this letter did go
she's happy up there with her mommy i know"

"beauty is a rare perfume
precious, yet doesn't last long
youth is but a playful breeze
that blows our way once then moves on
love is a hidden treasure
some never find where it lies
and memory is a little bird
flies through life, live or dies
chorus:
little bird
take me aboard your beautiful wings and let me fly
fly me away back to yesterday
and drop me off there awhile
let me smell the rare perfume of the sweet flower of beauty again
let me run in the playful breeze of youth long gone with the wind
let me sit for awhile by the place where i found the treasure of love
then sing me a song as you fly me along on our long last journey above"

i wonder why mommy don't come
she told me to shut up my blue eyes
and before i woke up she'd be home
she said she was going to see grandma
who lives by the river so wide
and i guess my mommy fell in there
and perhaps she won't be home tonight
so i guess i'll go down and meet daddy
perhaps he has stopped at the store
it's a great big store full of bottles
and i wish he wouldn't go there anymore
so out in the night with the baby
her little heart beating with pride
'til her tired feet entered the gin palace
with music all radiant with light
oh daddy she cried as she reached him
i think that the music's so sweet
but it's almost suppertime daddy
little blossom wants something to eat
a moment his blurred eyes gazed wildly
down into her face sweet and fair
and as the demon possessed him
he grasped at the back of a chair
a moment a second was over
he lifted her fair golden head
a moment the baby's life trembled
then poor little blossom was dead"

fancy clothes, a magic coach

gotta aim straight as an arrow

the sweeter grass that's greener?
to chase the all american dream

at the top and still i've got
a heavy heart inside
i keep remembering
things my daddy told me as a child
you gotta walk the striaght and narrow
gotta hold fast to the right
gotta aim straight as an arrow
walk onward toward the light

i think i might get by

as you fill our hearts with tenderness and emotions inside
lost in each other with the world closed outside
oh this must be like heaven it's heaven to you and i love you're so beautiful tonight
your nearness in the silence your rapid heartbeat
your face touching mine then you whisper on my cheek
i'll love you till the stars in the heavens lose their lights
oh love you're so beautiful tonight
as you fill our hearts...
i'll love you till the stars..."

i can see it on your face it's over it's all over it's all over me and you
love came down like the rains from heaven
love's all over us dripping like the morning dew
we can't hide it anymore you can't hide real love
when it's all over all over me and you
and it's wonderful to know it's all over love sweet love it's all over me and
you
once we worried what folks would think if they only knew
just how much love there was between me and you
oh but it's no secret anymore it's all out in plain view
and love's all over us love's all over me and you
we can't hide it anymore..."
"what are you looking at, love boy?
it won't do you any good
cause i know your kind!
if you wanna be mine
we gotta get this understood!
oh, i'm not gonna be, won't be your love du jour
your special off the day, no way, i'll do farewell, bonjour
pardon my french, but there's no chance in the hell for you, for sure
and if you think that i will be, i'll be your lover du jour
i'm what?
lover du jour!
not me!
i am well aware of your good looks and sexy ways
serving up yourself to girls to satisfy your taste
the fresh catch of the day, on your romeo buffet
served up hot and ready, just having it your way
well, if i'm on the menu, you'd better get this straight
me and you had better come to terms before you grab your plate
don't need once place to order if you believe that i
i'm just some cheesy little dish, just another chickie pie
no, i won't gonna be, won't be your love du jour
the flavor of the day, no way, i'll do farewell, bonjour
but there's no chance in the hell that i endure
the fact that i would only be your lover du jour
oubliez moi! forget me!
still looking, lover boy?
have you changed your view?
i told you once, i'll say it again
i'll take no... from you!
that's great!
if you want something appetizing
something real and satisfying
i'll be worth a second look, cause that's the only way!
cause, i won't gonna be, won't be your love du jour
your playmate of the day, no way, i'll do farewell, bonjour
cause i won't be caught up in your charm and your allure
no, i'm not gonna be, won't be your lover du jour!
no, i'm not gonna be, won't be your lover du jour!
no, i won't gonna be, won't be your love du jour
the special off the day, no way, i'll do farewell, bonjour!
pardon my french, but there's no chance in the hell that i'll endure
the fact that i would only be your lover du jour
no, i'm not gonna be, won't be your lover du jour!
your lover du jour!
i am not for your amusement
i am not a toy, you are nothing but trouble!
you are a bad boy!
i am a tasty... around a full course meal
desert after dinner drink, and you can have no feel"
"and so you have come back to me
and say the old loves growing yet
you've tried through all these weary years
you've tried so vainly to forget
chrous:
oh no, i cannot take your hand
god never gives is back our youth
the loving heart you slighted then
was yours, my friend, in perfect truth
come close and let me see your face
your raven hair is tinged with snow
oh, yes, it is the same dear face
i loved so many years ago
repeat chorus
farewell, i think i love you yet
as friend to friend, god bless you dear
and guide you through these weary years
to where the skies are always clears
repeat chorus"

"as i sit here tonight, the jukebox playing
that old song about the wild, wild side of life.
as i listen to the words you are saying,
it brings memories when i was a trusting wife.
it wasn't god who made honky tonk angels
as you say in the words of your song.
too many times married men think they're still single
and that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.
it's a shame that all the blame is on us women,
it's not true that only you, men, feel the same.
from the start most every heart that's been broken
was because there always was a man to blame.
it wasn't god who made honky tonk angels
as you said in the words of your song.
too many times married men think they're still single
and that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.
it wasn't god who made honky tonk angels

"another sleepless night alone, crazy from this jealousy.
i heard you call her on the phone,
watched you shave and dress and leave.
walk the floor and watch the clock,
knowing that you ain't missing me.
imagination runnin' hot, and you're right where you wanna be.
do you think i'm made of stone?
do you think it doesn't hurt when you leave me here alone,
leaving me to think the worst?
and when you're out there in her arms 'til the wee hours of the dawn,
do you think it's all a joke?
can't you see my heart is broke?
do you think i'm made of stone?
i'm just barely gettin' 'round,
don't know how i'm getting by.
all our friends i meet in town,
they just can't look me in the eye.
they all know you're runnin' 'round.
like me, they don't know what to do.
god, i hate their sympathy,
but i just can't turn loose of you.
but do you think i'm made of stone?
don't you know my pain is real?
it's the worst i've ever known just stayin' at an even keel.
oh, what am i supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
i should leave, i know i should;
i just only wish i could.
do you think i'm made of stone?
oh, it cuts me like a knife,
you have stripped me of my pride.
what am i supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
do you think it's all a joke?
can't you see my heart is broke?
do you think i'm made of stone?
another sleepless night alone,
i guess you think i'm made of stone."
"of all the roads i've traveled and all the sights i've seen
the most amazing thing is the power of our dreams
and anything is possible for those who can believe
just get your heart to rearrange its priorities
for us to make love work
we've got to try a little harder
and for love to work we gotta hold on
a human heart is just too precious
to spend it feeling hurt
let's start to take the chance to make love work
it takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye
and it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try
there's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue
you can bet your bottom dollar i'll be there for you
for us to make love work
we've got to try a little bit harder
and for love to work we gotta hold on
a human heart is just too precious
to spend it feeling hurt
let's start to take the chance to make love work
oh i do believe in miracles
but i know they don't come easy
so why don't we give destiny
a helping hand
for us to make love work
we've got to try a little bit harder
and for love to work we gotta hold on
a human heart is just too precious
to spend it feeling hurt
let's start to take the chance to make love work
life is just too beautiful
to spend it feeling hurt
let's start to take the chance to make love work"
"making believe that you still love me
it's leaving me alone and so blue
i'll always dream, still i'll never own you
making believe, its all i can do
can't hold you close when you're not with me
you're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
making believe that i'll spend my lifetime
loving you and making believe
making believe that i never lost you
but my happy hours are fun and so few
my plans for the future will never come true
making believe what else can i do
can't hold you close when you're not with me
you're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
making believe that i'll spend my lifetime
loving you and making believe"
"you say tomorrow you're going
it's so hard for me to believe
i'm making plans for the heartaches
'cause you're making plans to leave
the tears for me will be falling
like a tree shedding its leaves
i'm making plans for the tear drops
'cause you're making plans to leave
you're making plans to forget me
i'm making plans to miss you
i'm getting ready ti grieve
i'm making plans to be lonesome
'cause you're making plans to leave
i'm making plans to be lonesome
'cause you're making plans to leave"
"malena for hours would run in the meadow well malena would go to play every day
she chased butterflies and she'd say with the smile
if i had wings i could fly that away
malena would cry when we try to explain
that little girl's world's supposed to haven wings
that only in heaven can little girls fly we'd see a strange look in malena's eyes
we'll always remember malena's last birthday
boxes with bright colored ribbon and string
and the wish that she made as she blew out the candles
a wish that malena had wings
and with all the gifts that we bought for malena
the wish that she made we could not satisfy
but on the night of her birthday the angels fullfilled it
they gave her wings and now malena can fy
malena has wings and malena can fly on the wings of an angel in heaven on high
from the time she could talk her wish was the same a wish that malena had wings"
"the bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see
perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me
temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be
so mama when you pray tonight
say a special prayer for me
i miss your tender good night kiss of love and understanding
the good night kisses i get now are cruel and so demanding
so mama when you pray tonight
and while you're on your knees
mama say a special prayer for me
the nights get cold and lonely
when you're faraway from home
and lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong
evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me
so mama when you pray tonight
say a special prayer for me
i miss your tender good night kiss of love and understanding
these good night kisses i get now are cruel and so demanding
so mama when you pray tonight
and while you're on your knees
mama say a special prayer for me"
"i don't know why i like him i just only know i do
i don't know why i trust him i just know his heart is true
i don't know why he's more a man than any man i know
i don't know how i know the man's for real but i still know
the man is more than what meets the eye he is worn and weary from life
he is rugged but he's got style the man has got what matters inside
weary yes he must get weary but he doesn't say
but you can read between the lines that wind along his face
the man has got his memories that he hides inside his mind
and you can see the sadness in the eyes they hide behind
the man is more than what meets the eye...
love him yes i've always loved him and i always will
he holds a place in my heart no one else could ever fill
he's always been my hero, the best friend i've ever had
the man is something special and i'm proud that he's my dad
the man is more than what meets the eye...
the man is more than what meets the eye..."

'twas on one cold winty night
and the wind blew across the wild moor
as poor mary came wandering home with her child
she stopped at her own father's door
oh, father, dear father, she cried
come down and open the door
or the child in my arms will perish and die
from the winds that blow across the wild moor
but the father wasdeaf to her cry
not a sound of her voice did he hear
though the watch dogs did howl and the village bells tolled
and the winds blew across the wild moor
oh, how the old man must have felt
when the came to the door the next morn
and found mary dead, but the child still alive
closely clasped in it's dead mother's arms
in anguish he tore his gray hair
and the tears down his cheeks they did pour
when he saw how that night she had perished and died
from the winds that blew across the wild moor
the old man with grief pined away
and the child to it's mother went soon
and no one they say has lived there to this day
and the cottage to ruin has gone
but the villagers point out the spot
where the willows droop over the door
saying there mary died once a g** village bride
from the winds that blew across the wild moor"

will one day walk on water?

would calm a storm, with his hand?
did you know, that your baby boy
has walked where angels and when you kiss? your little baby
you've kissed the face of god
oh mary, did you know? oh, ooh woah, ooh woah
ooh, ooh

the deaf will hear
the dead will live again

that he choose you to bring
to us, the king of kings

little footprints in the snow made by our children's feet
as i walked them to the good will store to get some clothes to wear
as we turned around the corner i saw you standing there
i tried to turn the children and walk the other way
i prayed they hadn't seen you then i heard the baby say
""mommie, ain't that daddy holding out his hand
begging for money from that other man?""
they asked me ""ain't that daddy?""
and ""yes"" i had to say
and i wondered if i'd failed you
and made you turn this way
no, you didn't fail me, my weakness was just too strong
because you see, i thought more of the bottle than our family and our home
no, you didn't fail me sweetheart, you loved me all you could
you had my babies and you loved me like no other woman ever would
you know i guess i'd be better off dead
than in the awful ship i'm in
but death just don't seem to have a place for those that stay drunk on whiskey, wine and gin
you see i die a constant death over and over every day
if i could change, you know i'd do it for you, the babies and our home
but you might as well forget me for i'm just too forward gone
but i wish you would do me one last favor and do it just for me

just say ""it used to be"""

i'll think of all the years we've spent together

and each sadness like the flaming pits of hell
but each thing we share just makes our love grow stronger
and i love you more than words could ever tell
when the golden years have slowly come upon us
and our children have all married off and gone
you know sweetheart each day our love grows more exciting
and i love you more as each day passes on
we've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
and we love each other more than words can tell
and each day as we grow closer to god's calling
i pray he'll call us at the same time there to dwell
we've seen happiness...

we once were so close now the love light that glowed has now gone out of our
lives
and the good life we had for some reason went bad
and the love that once lived here has died
how did we get here where did it start when did we walk out of each other's
heart
where did we lose it how did love die when where and how but most of all why
most of all why did we let love die like the withering leaves in the fall
and why did we wait till it was too late to realize how much we'd lost
how did we get here...
when where and how but most of all why"

from album little sparrow
pretty as an angel from the day that she was born skin as fair as lily's hair,
as golden as the corn they knew that she was special from the moment she first
cried she was a mountain angel certified
she was her momma's baby, she was her daddy's pride
good at home, at church and school, at everything she tried
everybody's darlin' led a charmed and peaceful life
the perfect mountain angel 'til he arrived and ohh, she fell so deeply ooh,
she couldn't stop she gave herself to him, milled it completely
he lifted her so high he let her drop
she gave up everything for him that mattered in her life
all the others that had loved her and she vowed to be his wife
she dreamed of bearing children in an ivy covered house
the mountain angel's sunshine turned to clouds
the wicked handsome stranger left the way he came
broke her heart and broke her mind she never was the same
they say he was the devil
that had come to steal her soul
she never loved another it was told
they say she had a baby
some say that it had died
they it's just as well
as it had been the devil's child
they say good conquers evil
but here, evil won the prize
so the mountain angel took to the wild
and ooh, she couldn't take it
years passed and she had long since lost her mind
she waited for him as her beauty faded
her parents died from grief before their time
she tried to gather pieces of her life, they wouldn't fit
beside the tiny grave deep in the woods is where she'd sit
talking to the child, herself, to him, who knew for sure
possessed they say by satan's insane lure
high a'top the mountain, for years they say she's seen
looking down upon the town where she had once been queen
she'd sneak around the playground, watch the little children play
they'd see the crazy lady then run away
they say she roamed these hills for years, wearing not a stitch
the lovely mountain angel now thought to be a witch
she made those wailing mournful sounds
that you could hear for miles
long after she laid down upon her baby's grave and died
and ooh, her ghost is callin'
she's waiting for the ones that she adored
through spring and summer, fall when snow is fallin'
her spirit roams these hills forever more the mountain angel's voices ever more
oohh, oooo oohh, oooo oohh, oooo"

i was just a little past eighteen
when i came to new orleans
i'd never been beyond my home state line
there was a boy who loved me dearly
but i broke his heart severely
when i left my blue ridge mountain boy
life was dull in my hometown
lights were out when the sun went down
and i thought that city life was more my style
but nights get lonely away from home
and it's easy to go wrong
the men ain't kind like my blue ridge mountain boy
new orleans held things in store
things i'd never bargained for
and every night a different man knocks on my door
but late at night when all is still
i can hear a whippoorwill
as i cry for my blue ridge mountain boy
oh but i can never go back home
since the boy i love is gone
he grew tired of waiting for me to return
they say he married last october
but i never will get over
oh the sweet love of my blue ridge mountain boy

and all at once he left and all at once my heart started breaking breaking
judging by my love for him i thought his love for me was just as strong
and all the things he told me i really thought he meant them all alone
he had no plans to carry out all his plans that we'd been making
cause all at once he left and all at once my heart started breaking breaking

there's no love left our love's beyond help
why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left
the feeling we felt for each other for a long time now has been dying
we'd both be better off without each other
we can't bring it back to life why do we keep trying
there's no love left...
when love is gone it's gone and you can't bring it back
when the warm sun goes down it turns cold
we both might as well just accept the fact there's nothing warm left for us to
hold
there's no love left...
there's no love left..."

there is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
there's no tiny hands to reach out to us no plans bein' made anymore
we have no tomorrow our future is gone there is only sadness in store

"o little town of bethlehem,
how still we see the lie!
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by;
yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light;
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee to night.
for christ is born of mary,
and gathered all above,
while mortals sleep, the angels keep
their watch of wondering love.
o morning stars, together
proclaim the holy birth!
and praises sing to god the king,
and peace to men on earth.
how silently, how silently,
the wondrous gift is given!
so god imparts to human hearts
the blessings of his heaven.
no ear may hear his coming,
but in this world of sin,
where meek souls will receive him, still
the dear christ enters in.
where children pure and happy
pray to the blessed child,
where misery cries out to thee,
son of the mother mild;
where charity stands watching
and faith holds wide the door,
the dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
and christmas comes once more.
o holy child of bethlehem!
descend to us, we pray;
cast out our sin and enter in,
be born in us to day.
we hear the christmas angels
the great glad tidings tell;
o come to us, abide with us,
our lord emmanuel!"

my mama and daddy must have loved each other

and the girls worked just as hard as the boys did
there was corn to hoe then we'd go hoe it
we might have been poor but we didn't know it
we'd heard that word but we didn't know what it meant

from kin folks livin' up north in some big town
we'd think of all the games we'd play
and we just couldn't hardly wait

we'll just live our lives one day at a time
just one thing i'm learning you take life as it comes
each day is just a gift so don't be blind
tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
we'll just live our lives one day at a time
we may not have a fortune making plans to change the world
we may leave little marks in life's design
but as long as we're together every hour is filled with love
and we'll just live our lives one day at a time
just one thing i'm learning...
we'll just live our lives one day at a time"
"it's been one of those days
that reminded me in many ways
of when we were happy, still in love
just a certain way the wind blows
just a certain way the sun glows
it's been one of those days that reminded me of us
and even though it's over i never will get over
these feelings that i get on certain days
and i know i'll always love you
and i'll always be thinkin' of you
in certain kinds of ways, on certain kinds of days
and today well, it's been one of those days
it's been one of those days and my heart feels so heavy
and my mind is so full of thoughts of you
it's been one of those days and i'd give my life to see you
and to once more know the love that we once knew
and even though it's over i never will get over
oh these feelings that i get on certain days
i guess i know i'll always love you
and i'll always be thinkin' of you
in certain kinds of ways, on certain kinds of days
and today well, it's been one of, one of those days
it's been one of those days
that reminded me in many ways
of when we were happy, still in love"

and my tears will still be streamin' as my broken heart beats on.
yes, i know i'm only dreamin', but i'll just keep dreamin' on.
i will dream about the pleasures that we shared in days gone by.
and i'll remember and i'll treasure every kiss and your kind eyes.
and i will dream that you still hold me in your arms as you did then.
and i'll recall each thing you told me hear your voice as i did when.
yes, i know i'm only dreamin' but i'll dream and i'll pretend.
i'll be here and i'll be waiting, and i will dream of your return.
some will say i'm being foolish, while some will say that i am just blind.
and that i won't face what the truth is, that you are no longer mine.
but i will dream you'll be returning some sweet day to their surprise.
and you will say your love's still burnin',
you'll dry these teardrops from my eyes.
oh, i know i'm only dreamin', 'cause i'll awake and be alone.
and my tears will still be streamin', and you will still be just as gone.
yes, i know i'm only dreamin', but i'll just keep dreamin' on.
yes, i know i'm only dreamin'"

i'm standing outside of your door

is so far above
anything i ever knew
so here i am
i'm outside your door
knowing what's waiting inside
heaven on earth
and for all that it's worth
we'll be here 'til we're both satisfied
two bottles of wine

champagne and roses waiting back at our suite

"i grew up dirty and i grew up poor
the wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
and i had the gift of imagination
i could change my situation
anytime i choose i could always go
down paradise road
i found a kingdom deep within
a place dream and to pretend
and to prepare for the world out there
a dream can dress you when you're ragged
fill you up when hunger's naggin'
i warmed my soul when life was cold
on paradise road
chorus:
paradise is a state of mind
the sun shines warm and all the time
and the rain don't flow and the wind don't blow
on paradise road
a place no one can take from me
a place of everlasting peace
where dreamers go; it's never closed
paradise road
paradise is a state of mind
down the road of life and time
and the friends we meet
make the travlin' sweet
on paradise road
sometimes now when the world is mad
i find that place i've always had
inside my soul; it's paved in gold
paradise road
i grew up dirty and i grew up poor
the wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
but i had the gift of imagination
i could change my situation
anytime i choose i could always go

"as we were dressing to go out our little girl and boy
came in and asked if they could go this time
we told them little girls and boys don't belong at parties
and that they should be in bed asleep by nine
the babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbye
and told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cry
then we left for the party like we'd so often done
thinkin' only of ourselves and not our little ones
the party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore on
with drinking laughing teling dirty jokes nobody thinkin' of home
then the stranger feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bones
and i told my wife that we'd better leave the party
cause i felt that we were needed at home
as we rode along i got to thinking of how the kids that mornin'
had asked if we would take them to church the next day
and how i'd put 'em off like i'd so often done
by sayin' we'd probably get home too late
then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
as they cut through the still night air
then we turned down our street that's when we saw the fire
the rest was like a nightmare
we took their little bodies to church the next day
though we'd left the party early we still got home too late"
"now i've been happy lately
thinking about the good things to come
and i believe it could be
something good has begun
oh, i've been smiling lately
dreaming about the world as one
and i believe it could be

'cause out on the edge of darkness
there rides a peace train
peace train take this country

pink will just be a color
not a ribbon to remember
a best friend or a mother
someday
you won't have to put a wig on
and a baseball cap will just be a hat
not somethin' to hide under
'cause your hair is gone
someday's comin' any day
you gotta believe without seeing
you gotta keep going, keep breathing
when you face a day that feels like you're gonna break
lean on the ones that love you
the guardian angels above you
and think, about when pink
was just another color
someday
your time will be your own time
no waiting rooms or doctor news, that
make you wanna cry
and someday
we're gonna have a party
we'll pop pink balloons, with people who know
love can be an army someday, it's coming any day
you gotta believe without seeing
you gotta keep going, keep breathing
when you face a day that feels like you're gonna break

the mid summer sun shines but dim the fields try in vain to look g**
but when i was happy with him december was pleasant as may
there once was a time he and i picked flowers to braid in my hair
and the songbirds would sing sweet song of love that was tender and fair
no difference the seasons may quit our love was as warm as the sun
and it mattered not where did the snow
or green grass kissed the fields where we'd run
now the mid summer sun shines...
sweet flowers sweet birds and sweet song have now lost their sweetness to me
for ever my darling is gone and for ever my heartbroken i'll be
now the mid summer sun shines...

"eve you wicked woman, you done put your curse on me
why didn't you just leave that apple hangin' in the tree
you make us hate our husbands, our lovers and our boss
why i can't even count the good friends i've already lost
cause of pms blues, pms blues
i don't even like myself, but it's something i can't help
i got those god almighty, slap somebody pms blues
most times i'm easy going, some say i'm good as gold
but when i'm pms i tell ya, i turn mean and cold
those not afflicted with it are affected just the same
you poor old men didn't have to grin and say ""i feel your pain""
pms blues, pms blues
you know you must forgive us for we care not what we do
i got those can't stop crying, dishes flying pms blues
but you know we can't help it
we don't even know the cause
but as soon as this part's over, then comes the menopause
oh, lord, oh, lord
we're going to always be a heap of fun
like the devil taking over my body, suffering, suffering, suffering
everybody's suffering, huh?
but a woman had to write this song, a man would be scared to
lest he be called a chauvenist or just fall victim to
those pms blues
you know we'd kill for less than that
pms blues
you don't want to cross my path
cause a pitbull ain't no match
for these teeth a clenchin', fluid retention
head a swellin', can't stop yellin'
got no patience, i'm so hateful
pms blues, premenstrual syndrome
got those moods a swingin', tears a slingin'
nothin' fits me when it hits me
rantin', ravin', misbehavin'
pms blues
it's the only time in my life i ever think about wishing i'd been a man
but you know that only means one thing
if i'd have been a man, i'd be somewhere right this very minute
with some old cranky, naggin', raggin' hateful woman
with those old pms blues
pms blues
i don't want to talk about it, we both could do without it
got those treat your kids bad, don't you talk back
gone ballistic, unrealistic
awful lowdown, b**** to be around

love can make you cry like a little bitty child
oh the power of love can make you sad and lonely

love can make your sky turn blue when it's stormy weather
love can make you feel so cold or burn a hole right through your soul
the most powerful thing in the world must be love
oh the power of love...
love can make your whole world shake like a large explosion
or love can leave you quiet and still if it takes a notion
love can take you way up high and make you jump thinkin' you can fly

oh they talk about the lovers
that i keep undercover
and i wish that i was as much fun
as they have you believe
just like alec baldwin
i'd love to whack 'em all one
but instead i'll wait and see
who i am sleepin' with next week
i'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids
and i rule the trashy kingdom
but the rumors raise my cue score
and pay for my big home
i guess i 'augt to sue them
but instead i guess i'll use them
to keep me in the spotlight
and keep me on my throne
cause i'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids"

cindy was a ragged angel just a poor girl on her street
cindy's eyes showed signs of hunger never had enough to eat
cindy was a ragged angel golden hair and eyes of blue
cindy loved her paper dolly that's the only love she knew
cindy never knew her daddy and her mommie was seldom home
except for cindy's paper dolly cindy was all alone
cindy slept with her paper dolly on a blanket on the floor
she would shiver as the wind blew through the crack beneath the door
one night she laid with her paper dolly cold and hungry on the floor
that night god came for the ragged angel
and now cindy won't ever be cold and hungry no not anymore ragged angel"

"verse 1:
there will come a day when sorrow fades away,
and anguish and heartache shall ease,
no mothers cryin', no soldiers dyin',
and turmoil and misery shall cease.

the hungry shall be fed, the aimless shall be led
and sad eyes will no longer weep,
the last shall be first, through heaven he'll burst
with his heavenly host from the east

weapons to plowshares, hate turns to love,
descending from heaven he'll sweep down to us
in radiant splendor; oh, won't it be sweet

oh, there will come a day when i'll fly away
forever to be in his keep
eternal life in the sweet by and by
when raven dove, raven dove speaks

when lambs walk with lions, a child tames the beast
nations shall gather and bow at his feet
and loved ones shall rise up from their earthly sleep
and he'll separate all the chaff from the wheat.

you just can't forget it

where the charming roses bloom
forever
and when separation comes no more
if we never meet again

i will meet you on that beautiful shore

the world is cruel and people are cold

and choose to walk a mile

"you gotta snazzy new car in your driveway,
expensive new clothes on your back.

but you know that's a crock
'cause you only care for yourself.
your attitude stinks and i hate it.
you're arrogant, cocky and rude.
you're selfish, conceited and jaded.
everything's all about you;
you think that i'm lucky to have you.
you think you're so handsome, so what?
i'm calling you out 'cause i don't need this crap.
i'm gettin' myself out of dodge.
'cause you don't know love from shinola.
with you, love is not what i found.
a woman needs someone to hold her
not someone to just lay her down.
i want someone i can count on, a cool head,
a warm heart and shoulder to cry on,
rely on, today and from now on.
but you don't know love from shinola.
you don't know love from shinola.
oh, but i gave you love and affection,
but you never gave one iota.
it was an early detection that you don't know love from shinola.
you don't know love from shinola.
you don't know what true love's about.
'cause you'll find your world growin' colder
when you're alone and without.
so go on, lover boy, have a big time,
drink up on your bourbon and cola.
when you sober up you'll be bleep out of luck
'cause you don't know love from shinola.
i'm in it for love but you're just playing stud,
'cause you don't know love from shinola.
you don't know love, you don't know love.
you don't know love,

"well, i met an old man walkin' down the street
his clothes were torn and tattered
with sandals on his feet
and i stopped to help him
and lend him a hand
he said, i love you so much
but you must understand
1st chorus:
silver and gold might buy you a home
but things of this world
they won't last you long
and time has a way of turning us old
and time can't be bought back with silver and gold
and he said to me, let's rest for awhile
for i have some good news to share with you, child
he said, you can't change this old world
the people need to know
that a dear savior died here
a long, long time ago
repeat 1st chorus
his eyes shown like diamonds
and his smile was heaven sent
his hair was long and flowing
and his back was slightly bent
and i knew he knew it
for that day i changed
as i watched him walk on
i forgot to get his name
2nd chorus:
he said, silver and gold can't buy you a home
when this life has ended
and your time is gone
but you can live in a world where
you'll never grow old
and things can't be bought there with silver and gold
tag:
and time can't be bought back with silver and gold"

you'll wake my mother
she's sleeping here right by my side
in her right hand is a silver dagger
she says that i can't be your bride
all men are fools
so says my mother
they'll tell you again
love and lies
and then they'll go
and court someother
leave you alone to pine inside
my daddy is a handsome devil
he's got a chain five miles long
on every link, a heart does dangle
of another maid he's loved and wronged, ohhh
go court another tender maiden
in hopes that she might be your wife
for i've been warned so i decided
i'll sleep alone all of my life, ohh...
beware, beware, a silver dagger"
"silver sandals.
in silver sandals she goes walkin' up those golden stairs
and though we miss her so we know she's happy to be there
she walks with us in memory we see her all the time
in silver sandals walkin' through our minds.
so many times we let our thoughts turn back to yesterday
to a little girl that could only watch the children as they played
she walks with us in memories we see her all the time
in silver sandals walkin' through our minds
the grave in which she sleeps is cold but our thoughts of her are warm
and we cry as we both long to hold her in our arms
each night in dreams we see her running to us smiling sweet
with silver sandals on her feet
in silver sandals she goes walkin' ...
she had asked for sandals from the time that she could talk
and it would break our hearts when she'd asked us why she couldn't walk
she'd say when i go to heaven can i change my crutches then
for a pair of silver sandals at the rainbow's end
in silver sandals she goes walkin'...
in silver sandals she goes walkin' through our minds."

silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
and i dare not drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine.
you can't buy my love with money, for i never was that kind,
silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine.

drinkin' beer in amarillo
passing time and swaping jokes

mmm, what's that perfume that you're wearing?

"i remember a time when the bloom was on the cotton
when our hearts chased the clouds like the swallow on the wing
when our cares which were already few, some forgotten
just sitting on the front porch swing
oh we'd sit every sunday, and watch the married ladies
and we'd dream of white dresses and church bells in the spring
and they'd talk and paint their nails while they let us hold their babies
sitting on the front porch swing
where was i when the time came to join the married ladies
why did i paint the nail when the finger had no ring
why do i sit at my age and long to hold their babies
sitting on the front porch swing
when the mind longs to follow, but the memory erases
and the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings
when the leaves in the hollow have been dyed to match our faces
sitting on the front porch swing
oh we'll dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton
when our hearts chased the clouds like the swallow on the wing
but the words to the rhyme are not the only things forgotten
sitting on the front porch swing
sitting on the front porch swing"

"you jark back your hand away from mine and i move my lips away from yours
then quietly we sit tryin' to forget
those deep running thoughts that run wild across our minds
you quickly stop the words you start to say and we realize just how close we are
and we both know if we let ourselves go we'll do something we'll be sorry for
slip away today means sorrow tomorrow
it's love we know but we can't keep but yet we like to borrow
trying to hold back emotions and desires
it's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for
my love hungry heart begs for more of what your lips hold in store
but our conscience just won't let us at least tonight it kept us
from jumpin' off the deep end and going too far
but one of these night you and i will be ruled by the passion of our hearts
and we both know if we let ourselves go and do something that we'll be sorry for
slip away today means...

"sweet little cherry blossom, blooming before her time
moving her lips to her favorite song, cherishing every rhyme
swaying her hips to the rhythm, humming along with the tune
lost in her own little dream world, slow dancing with the moon
watching her i cannot help but go back in my mind
and suddenly i find i am 15 again
slow dancing with the moon
oh, the stars got in my eyes long time ago
and i've lived my life like a love sick clown
in a bittersweet cartoon
just a dreamy eyed kid slow dancing with the moon
watching the girl i'm reminded she's quite a lot like me
trapped in the suburbs of wonderland, lost in her own fantasy
somehow my heart never grew up, no one ever burst my balloon
so here i am swirling in star dust slow dancing with the moon
still believe someday my wildest dreams will all come true
and i'll find someone who'll make me 15 again
but until then i'm slow dancing with the moon
oh, the stars got in my eyes long time ago
and i've lived my life like a love sick clown

lord knows i made crying an art

"i just want to be somebody's everything.
you say i've seen too many movies, watched too much tv,
read too many fairy tales that i live and make believe.
you say the kind of love i'm dreamin' of does not exist.
and there's no one like i'm searchin' for, well, i believe there is.
and i want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me,
have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
reality and fantasy should be one in the same
and i want to be somebody's everything.
i refuse to settle for something less than great.
and if it takes a lifetime, then that's how long i'll wait.
'cause all i want is everything, is that too much to ask?
have romance, love and passion; find magic that will last.
and i want someone to think they'll die if they can't be with me.
i want to be their joy, their pride, their dreams,
the very air they breathe.
i want to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
yes, i want to be somebody's everything, somebody's everything.
oh, i want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me.
have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
i'd love to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
yes, i want to be somebody's everything.
someone to hold me close and tremble when the lovin's done.
think it's heaven, call me angel, think i hung the moon and sun.
get misty eyed just knowin' with a love song people sing.
yes, i want to be somebody's everything.
and i'm gonna be somebody's everything, somebody's everything.
i want to be, i'm gonna be somebody's everything.
i want to be, i want to be somebody's everything,
somebody's everything, somebody's"

always be good
to one

grasping for love where there's no love at all

somewhere between your heart and mine there's a love i can't understand
it's there for a while then it fades like a smile and i'm left in the middle again

we built our home on happiness then suddenly it fell
it wasn't long there after our love began to tilt
sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
first came the weekly parties that never seemed to end
and then came the heartbreak brought by so called friends
i guess that i'm as much to blame while we share the guilt
sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
first came the weekly parties...

from the waterfall that i have found
from the meadow i hear meadowlarks a singing
seems there's sounds of nature all around
i can hear the wind go whistling through the treetops
i hear raindrops falling softly to the ground
in the distance i can hear the roar of thunder
seems there's sounds of nature all around
sounds of nature fill the air with music
how i love and cherish every sound
i often kneel in prayer to thank the master
for the sounds of nature all around
in a barren tree a lonesome dove is calling
for its mate that's nowhere to be found
in the garden i hear honeybees a humming
sounds of nature fill the air with music...
seems there's sounds of nature all around"

see the evening shadows start to come
listen to the nightbirds start their singing
now the sounds of night have just begun
a lonely hootowl cries out in the darkness
for its mate that's nowhere to be found
then a lonesome whippoorwill strats calling
their lonely voices fill the night with sound
hear the church bell ringing in the distance
what a mournful sound so late at night
wonder why the darkness makes it sound so lonesome
listen to the lonely sounds of night
the darkness seems to whisper in the silence
your love is gone but things will be all right
still my lonely heart cries through the darkness
listening to the lonely sounds of night
hear the church bell ringing in the distance..."

"writers robert plant, jimmy page
there's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
when she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
with a word she can get what she came for
woe oh oh oh oh oh
a stairway to heaven
there's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
in the tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
woe oh oh oh oh oh
makes me wonder
i wonder i really really wonder
there's a feeling i get when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts i have seen rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking
woe oh oh oh oh oh
it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn for those who stand long
and the forest will echo with laughter
woe oh oh oh oh oh
if there's a bustle in your hedgerow
don't be alarmed now
it's just a spring clean for the may queen
yes there are two paths you can go by
but in the long run
there's still some time to change the road you're on
oh it makes me wonder
your head is humming and it won't go in case you don't know
the piper's calling you to join him
oh can you hear the wind blow and did you know
your stairway lies upon the whispering wind
stairway to heaven
stairway to heaven
you can't buy it you can't borrow
you got to walk it straigt and narrow
stairway to heaven
stairway to heaven
stairway to heaven
and as we wind on down the road
our shadows taller than our souls
all that glitters is not gold
to be a rock and not a roll
the great almighty dollar leaves you lonley, lost and hollow
you can't fool yourself forever
you got to work to get to heaven
stairway to heaven
if we listen as hard as
to every question that we ask
the truth will come to us at last
and she's buying a stairway to heaven, uh uh uh."

peace and quite runnin' free

teach me to trust
darling you must
or else i'll go out of my mind
when i'm not near you
i always fear you
have somebody else on the line

or is it a knowing
a jealousy born out of truth
'cause i watch you flirt
and it's how you embrace
them with your eyes
that say i could lose

teach me to trust
make me feel loved
tell me i've no need to fear
just make me feel safe

i'll die from this feeling

and i believed in your flattering ways
you told me you needed me forever

"carroll county's pointed out as kind of square
the biggest thing that happens is the county fair
and i guess that's why it seemed like such a big event
what we all call the carroll county accident
the wreck was on the highway just inside the line
walter browning lost his life and for a time
it seemed that mary ellen jones would surely die
but she lived long enough for her to testify
now walter browning was a happy married man
and he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand
but it was gone nobody knew just where it went
he'd lost it in the carroll county accident
mary ellen testified he flagged her down
said he was sick and could she drive him into town
and no one even doubted what she said was true
cause she was well respected in the county too
now i went down to see the wreck like all the rest
the bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess
but i found something no one else had even seen
behind the dash in mary's crumpled up machine
a little matchbox circled by a rubberband
and inside the ring from walter browning's hand
and it took a while to figure out just what it meant
the truth about the carroll county accident
by dark of night i dropped the ring into a well
and i took a sacred oath that i would never tell
the secret of the carroll county accident
cause the county ordered dad a marble monument
i lost him in the carroll county accident"

"the first noel, the angel did say,
was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
in fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
on a cold winter's night that was so deep.
noel, noel, noel, noel,
born is the king of israel.
they looked up and saw a star
shining in the east, beyond them far;
and to the earth it gave great light,
and so it continued both day and night.
noel, noel, noel, noel,
born is the king of israel.
and by the light of that same star,
three wise men came from country far;
to seek for a king was their intent,
and to follow the star wherever it went.
noel, noel, noel, noel,
born is the king of israel.
this star drew night to the northwest,
o'er bethlehem it took its rest;
and there it did both stop and stay,
right over the place where jesus lay.
noel, noel, noel, noel,
born is the king of israel.
then entered in those wise men three,
full reverently upon their knee;
and offered there in his presence,
their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
noel, noel, noel, noel,
born is the king of israel."

to go dancing

and laughing
and squinting at the sun
waiting for the gulls
to tell them
when the fish will come

and weathered
from all the nets

they've learned to wait
they always know
that the tide will turn

than he knows
he can sell in a day;

hunt for whales

have caught so many

they hunt for snails

with a voice that was quiet and low,
said: ""what am i bidden for the old violin?""
and he held it up with the bow;
""a thousand dollars   and who'll make it two?
two thousand   and who'll make it three?
three thousand once, three thousand twice
and going   and gone,"" said he.
the people cheered, but some of them cried,
""we do not quite understand  
what changed its worth?"" the man replied:
""the touch of the masters hand.""
and many a man with life out of tune,
and battered and torn with sin,
is auctioned cheap to a thoughtless crowd.
much like the old violin.
a ""mess of pottage,"" a glass of wine,
a game and he travels on,
he's going once, and going twice  
he's going   and almost gone!
but the master comes, and the foolish crowd,
never can quite understand,
the worth of a soul, and the change that's wrought
by the touch of the master's hand."
"tonight i feel a chill in the air
as cold as that look on your face
i hear what you're saying but coming from you
goodbye seems so out of place
now how can you stand there and honestly say
there never wee any real promises made
chorus:
the moon is my witness
the stars will agree
they all heard you promise
you'd always love me
i know that it's true
but it's hard to believe
you lied to the moon
the stars and me
and what about all of those warm tender nights
did they mean nothing to you
and where are the feelings i thought that we shared
or have you forgotten them too
did you think i could just put your memory behind
when your words are still so very clear in my mind
chorus:
the moon is my witness
the stars will agree
they all heard you promise
you'd always love me
i know that it's true
but it's hard to believe
you lied to the moon
the stars and me
the moon is my witness
the stars will agree
they all heard you promise
you'd always love me
i know that it's true
but it's hard to believe
you lied to the moon
the stars and me
i know that it's true
but it's hard to believe
you lied to the moon
the stars and me
you lied"
"there are so many things that i don't understand
and i search my mind to try to find an answer
but the more i search the less i seem to find out why
like where where the wind goes, how does life begin
what happens when we die
the mystery of the mystery must stay unknown
only god can know and man must not see
great minds have tried but they will not find
the answer to the mystery of the mystery
man will seek the mystic rails of the mystery
but their silent halls reveal not a sound
many men will give their lives just to try to find
the answer to a mystery in their mind
the mystery of the mystery must stay unknown
only god can know and man must not see
great minds have tried but they will not find
the answer to the mystery of the mystery"
"oh, the pain of loving you
oh, the misery i go through
never knowing what to do
oh, the pain of loving you
you just can't stand to see me happy
seems you hurt me all you can
still i go on loving you
but i never understand
chorus:
to love and hate at the same time
the line between the two is fine
the two have bound me heart and soul
so strong that i can't let you go
repeat chorus"
"two people, together
it was just a dream until you came along
my heart was waiting just for you
tomorrow, forever
we both heard these promises for far too long
and now you make the words come true
so touch me now
i need to have you close tonight
and show me how
you can me feel this way
# you and me, we are the right combination
for love, we're all we need
it's just you and me, we make the right combination
straight from the heart, love is the key
can't keep it, a secret
everything i feel is written on my face
i can't hide my heart from you
you hold me, is magic
in your arms the world becomes a better place
now i know what love can do
here we go
exactly where the road will lead us
i don't know
i just know that you'll be there
# you and me, we are the right combination
for love, we're all we need
it's just you and me, we make the right combination
straight from the heart, love is the key
and whenever you, i'm there
every stumble and fall, i share
i'll be yours through it all
coz i care, about you baby
it's so easy to see, so strong
now i know you and me, belong
i'll be by your side forever....
# you and me, we are the right combination
for love, we're all we need
it's just you and me, we make the right combination
straight from the heart, love is the key"
"waiting for the train to come
i keep a'waiting for the train to come
dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
i keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come

old man staring from a doorway
my hope tarries in the distance
love comes on the wheels of my deliverance
oh oh oooh oh where is the river unbroken
oh oh oooh oh when will the whistle blow
waitin' for the train to come
i keep waitin' for the train to come
keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
in the heart of everything that is
all night sleepin' in a station
my god, it's hard not to be impatient
i watch through the windows of forgiveness
i cry but my word's my only witness
oh oh oooh oh where is the river unbroken
oh oh oooh oh when will the whistle blow
oh oh oooh oh where is the river unbroken
oh oh oooh oh when will the whistle blow
sometimes i feel i can't go on, i can't go on
i get so tired, all passion's gone
my heart, my head, my arms, my legs, i get so tired
without the strength to crawl away
then something breaks inside my soul, my strength is gone
that spirit's finally taking hold
my ears can hear, my eyes can see
those clouds of joy still cover me, cover me, cover me
oh oh oooh oh where is the river unbroken
oh oh oooh oh when will the whistle blow
oh oh oooh oh where is the river unbroken
oh oh oooh oh when will the whistle blow
oh oh oooh oh where is, where is the river unbroken

"well, i've sacrificed time with family and friends
gave up vacations for work without end
24/7, 365
but i was willing to make the sacrifice
but empty or full, i've carried my pale
you don't drink the water if you don't dig the well
through blood sweat and tears i have built a good life
but it didn't come without sacrifice
but i was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
and i was gonna win no matter how much i lost
all through the years i kept my eye on the prize
you ask if it's worth the sacrifice, the sacrifice
i think about jesus and all that he gave
and the ultimate sacrifice that he made
he is my strength and my guiding light
and he's taught me that nothing's without sacrifice
i was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
and i was gonna win no matter how much i lost
i wanted success and, brother, i've paid the price
and, yes, it's been worth the sacrifice, the sacrifice
i was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
and i was gonna win no matter how much i lost
grindstones and rhinestones have made up my life
but i've shined like a diamond through sacrifice
i was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost
and i was gonna win no matter how much i lost
but i hope god will tell me, 'well done, my child
you've won your reward through your sacrifice, the sacrifice'
the sacrifice
but sometimes i wonder in the still of the night
is it really worth the sacrifice
i've often laughed and i've often cried
i've often failed but i've always tried
i made the sacrifice"
"i've tried and i've tried for so long to please you
gave you every bit of my time
gave you everything i could possibly give you
my body, my heart, and my mind
i turned my family and good friends against me
listened to my own heart break
and i did it all in the name of love
gave up myself for your sake
and you never cared about me
you only hurt and deceive
i realize after all of these years
that you ain't worth the salt in my tears
you've cheated, you've lied and you've hurt me
over and over again
you promised to love me forever
but forever reached a bitter sweet end
been blinded by love to your actions
but at last i can see my way clear
i've cried and i've tried, and i've tried and i've cried
but you, you've never shed one tear
'cause you never cared about me
you only hurt and deceive
i realize after all of these years
that you ain't worth the salt in my tears
you ain't worth, you ain't worth the salt in my tears
treated like dirt, i'm hurt, i ain't hangin' 'round here
you've left me crying, left me crying for years
but you ain't worth the salt in my tears
you never cared about me
you only hurt and decieve
i realize after all of these years
that you ain't worth the salt in my tears
no you ain't worth the salt in my tears"
"chorus:
i am a seeker
a poor sinful creature
there is no weaker than i am
i am a seeker

so reach down
won't you reach out and lead me
guide me and keep me
in the shelter of your care each day
'cause i am a seeker
you are a keeper
you are the leader

i am a bad seed that fell by the way
i am a loser that wants to be a winner

as you move your hand slowly across my face
you're touch is as soft as the words you speak to me
what a love in the way i see you
i compare it with the beauty of the dawning
or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty
like the love in the way i see you
i compare it with the beauty of the dawning
or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue

take me there, won't you take me there
streets are of gold, gates of pearl, brilliant mansions
take me there, won't you take me there

take me and show me this rare place you speak of
take me there, won't you take me there
to this land of plenty where there is complete love
take me there, won't you take me there
at the foot of the throne the kingdom rejoices
take me there, won't you take me there
the angels are singing his praise with their voices
hallelujah, hallelujah take me there
peace, joy and love linger on through the ages
take me there, won't you take me there
lambs lay with lions and lions with babies
take me there, won't you take me there
take me and show me this rare place you speak of
take me there, won't you take me there
to this land of plenty where there is complete love
take me there, i can't take you there
but there is a church where they teach all about it
take me there, won't you take me there
there is a book we must not be without it
take me there, i will read with you there
there is an altar where sins are forgiven
take me there, yes i'll kneel with you there
we'll find there the god of eternal living

"there was a time we'd sit in the backyard cause the house would get so hot
from the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
and you'd play your old guitar we'd fight mosquitos and enjoyed
you backyard concerts for we had no television
we'd just begun our life as man and wife and hard ships then
could scaresly scare us into quittin'
things were far from bein' fine we often dined upon a dime
but there never was a time we didn't love
the christmas brought us saddest days
when your pride gave a way you told the kids
there'd be no gifts cause we were broke
though their little tears of grief was so hard to see it didn't hurt me
like the love i knew was in your throat
it was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
for it seemed ike nothing good would ever come
the doctor bills we couldn't pay they came and took our car away
but there never was a time we didn't love
now there's an easy chair for my back a satin pillow for your head
and the kids are wild about the brand new car
you and i can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry
if we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
no wonder in your prayers we've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
the years of rearin' kids and payin' bills
and i think he guied us not because we were smart but just because
there never was a time we didn't love
no there never was a time never was a time never was a time we didn't love"
"peace in the valley for me some day
well, i'm tired and so weary, but i must travel on
'til the lord comes and calls me away, oh yes
where the morning's so bright and the lamb is the light
and the night is as bright as the day, oh yes!
there will be peace in the valley for me some day
there will be peace in the valley for me, oh lord, i pray
there'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble i see
only peace in the valley for me, oh yes!
well the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
and the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes!
and the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
and i'll be changed, changed from this creature that i am, oh yes!
there will be peace in the valley for me some day
there will be peace in the valley for me, oh lord, i pray
and there'll be no sadness and no sorrow, no trouble i see
there will be peace in the valley for me, oh yes!
there will be peace in the valley for me, oh yes!"
"there'll be love love love oh precious love
just as long as there's two people there'll be love
in spite of hate that fills the land love will always have command
as long as there's two people there'll be love
god created man and woman at the start and he placed inside of them a lovin' heart
but it wasn't god that made the hate and lust
but as long as there's two people there'll be love
there'll be love love love...
for every person somewhere there's a mate it's the force for survival that brings hate
for even though the going might be rough
as long as there's two people there'll be love
you can lock a man behind a prison wall and you may think that he has no love at all
but there's someone somewhere that he's thinking of
for as long as there's two people there'll be love
there'll be love love love..."
"writer dolly parton
these old bones will tell your story
these old bones will never lie
these old bones will tell you surely
what you canâ€™t see with your eye
these old bones, i shake and rattle
these old bones, i toss and roll
and itâ€™s all in where they scatter
tells you what the future holds
oh, she lived up on the mountain
eleven miles or so from town
with a one eyed cat named wink,
a billy goat and a blue tick hound
her graying hair was braided
and wrapped around her head
and her dress was long and faded
and her home a rusty shed
in a little pouch of burlap
tied with a piece of twine
there were bones all shapes and sizes
gathered through the course of time
sheâ€™d throw them out before you
she swore that she could see
the present, past and future
she could ready your destiny
everybody knew about her
came to get their fortune read
concerning health and wealth and power
who to love and when to wed
well, i just like helpinâ€™ people
iâ€™m just glad that i could help
why, i know everybodyâ€™s secrets
but i keep it to myself
these old bones will tell your story
these old bones will never lie
these old bones will tell you surely
what you canâ€™t see with your eye
these old bones, i shake and rattle
these old bones, i toss and roll
and itâ€™s all in where they scatter
tells you what the future holds
some called her witchy woman
some said she was insane
some said she was a prophet
still everybody came
just because a bodyâ€™s different
well, that donâ€™t make â€˜em mad
well, theyâ€™ve crucified a many
for the special gifts theyâ€™ve had
i had often heard about her,
dreamed about her now and then
for i, too, was clairvoyant,
came about when i was ten
i was fascinated with her
and the things iâ€™d heard about
and i knew some day iâ€™d meet her,
and one day it came about
well, i knowâ€™d that you â€˜uz aâ€™cominâ€™
i could feel it in my bones
these old bones have also told me
that i wonâ€™t be here for long
did you know that you â€˜uz adopted?
did you know you onceâ€™t was mine?
but the county took you from me,
said i wasnâ€™t right in mind
but i just knowâ€™d i had to see you
â€˜fore these bones was laid to rest
so i conjured up a message
it mustâ€™a worked, i guess
this gift runs in the family
i know you also know
and i passed this gift on to you
these old bones, theyâ€™re just for show
these old bones will tell your story
these old bones will never lie
these old bones will tell you surely
how to live and when youâ€™ll die
these old bones, i shake and rattle
these old bones, i toss and roll
and itâ€™s all in where they scatter
tells you what the future holds
i held her hand while she was dyinâ€™
and with the funeral through
i headed on back up the mountain
for billy, wink and blue
and that little pouch of burlap
with those bones so worn and old
she give me somethinâ€™ special
now every time i throw
these old bones will tell your story
these old bones will never lie
these old bones will tell you surely
what you canâ€™t see with your eye
these old bones, i shake and rattle
these old bones, i toss and roll
and itâ€™s all in how they scatter
tells you what the future holds
now i canâ€™t tell you what you want to hear
i just tell you what i see
itâ€™s these old bones aâ€™talkinâ€™
blame it on them; donâ€™t pack it on me
itâ€™s just like that time that there boy died
up at the sawmill
well, i knowâ€™d who done it, but i never said
and i knowâ€™d when somebody is a cheatinâ€™
or when somebodyâ€™s baby was gonna be born dead
but unless somebody just plain out and asked me
well, i just figured there ainâ€™t no point goinâ€™ around actinâ€™ like you know
everything, just â€˜cause you might.
ah, you know girl i want you to take these bones
â€˜cause i donâ€™t want no youngâ€™un of mine aâ€™going around unprepared
you just remember that the magic is inside you
there ainâ€™t no crystal ball"
"i can't forget you

you've been on my mind

so when you think about love, think about me
i can give you more than you'll ever need
sooner or later every heart needs some company
when you think about love, think about me
when you think about love, think about me
we were strangers
now i'm already wrapped around your finger
oh whats a heart to do
'cause it lingers
and the thought of you
wantin' me as much as i want you

"i saw him picking up the pieces of his broken heart
and so i stopped to see what i could do
his heart had been run over by a reckless lover
she ran over it and broke it and left it black and blue
tears were scattered everywhere he was trying to save his pride
he was the victim of a love and run
and i could plainly see that she had almost killed him
left the scene of a broken heart not looking back at what she'd done
oh, this boy has been hurt, i'll save him
i'll take his heart and mend it if i can
oh, this boy has been hurt, i'll save him
i'll take his tears and dry them as fast as he can cry them
i'll heal his hurt and make him as good as new again"
"here we are again going in this cheap place
what if was seen by a friend and they recognize our face
we both know that it's wrong we both should be at home
this time has gotta be our last time
i know that you want me just as much as i want you
you've got a family and i've got one too
from now on we must stay apart we just can't break all their hearts
this time has gotta be our last time
this time has gotta be our last time we'll put our rings that own our hands
your conscience hurt you well mine does too
i'm not this kind of woman and i'm not this kind of man
we just can't go on cheating neither of us is this kind
this time has gotta be our last time this time has gotta be our last time"

i'll always love you my little darling

but you're not there, and i'm so lonesome
without your love i'd go insane

it's not your lips now that drive me crazy
it's just your haunting memory

a read will hang upon your door tomorrow
of the little house that we once called our home
and friends will stop and hang their heads in sorrow
to pay the last respects to one gone on
tonight i lay me down to sleep forever with this small empty bottle and broken heart
i keep the vow i made i won't forsake it i promised to death do us part
will you bring your new love to the chapel
to look upon the one that you betrayed
will you bring me pretty flowers like you used to
and replace them in my hands where i lay
will you cry and think of happy mem'ries that we shared together at the start
and will you look upon me and remember the dsay we said till death do us part"

i didn't lie awake all these nights to have you come walking back in
i didn't change my whole life around, not to mention my dreams and my plans

time and tears have mended the pain
healed all the hurt and changed everything
time and tears i'm happy to say
time and tears have washed it away
time and tears have washed you away
i didn't think that i would survive the day that you walked out on me
i truly was more dead than alive; and the pain, lord i couldn't believe
i asked god to please have mercy on me and to ease all the feelings i felt
then i saw the light, now i'm more than alright;
i'm much better off since you left
time and tears have mended the pain
healed all the hurt and changed everything
time and tears have carried me through
time and tears got me over you
time and tears and somebody new
time and tears is all that it takes
to mend shattered hopes or a heart when it breaks
time and tears have carried me through

time and tears, got me over you"
"i've been around for you
been up and down for you
but i just can't get any relief
i've swallowed my pride for you
i've lived and lied for you
but you still make me feel like a thief
you've got me stealing your love away
'cause you never give it
peelin' the years away
and we can't relive it
i make you laugh and you make me cry
i believe it's time for me to fly
chorus:
time for me to fly
i've got to set myself free
time for me to fly
that's how it's got to be
i know it hurts to say goodbye
but it's time for me to fly
you said we'd work it out
you said that you had no doubt
i thought we were really in love
oh but i'm tired of holding on
to a feeling i know is gone
i do believe i've had enough
i've had enough of the falseness
of a worn out relation
enough of this jealousy and intoleration
i wonder why i even try
i believe it's time for me to fly
chorus:
time for me to fly
i've got to set myself free
time for me to fly
that's just how it's got to be
i know it hurts to say goodbye
but it's time for me to fly
time for me to fly
time for me to fly
i got to set myself free
time for me to fly
that's just how it's got to be
i make you laugh and you make me cry
i believe it's time for me to fly
time for me to fly
that's how it's got to be

"momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
if she did, she never did say so to daddy
she never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
if she did, she never did say so to daddy
the only things that seemed to be important in her life
was to make our house a home and make us happy
momma never wanted anymore than what she had
if she did, she never did say so to daddy
he often left her all alone
she didn't mind the stayin' home
if she did, she never did say so to daddy
and she never missed the flowers
and the gifts he never gave her
if she did, she never did say so to daddy
being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
and she didn't need those things to make her happy
she didn't even seem to notice
that he didn't kiss and hold her
if she did, she never did say so to daddy
chorus:
one morning we awoke
just to find the note
that momma carefully wrote
and left to daddy
and as he began to read it
our ears could not believe it
the words that she had written there to daddy
she said our kids are old enough
and they don't need me very much
so i've gone in search for love i need so badly
i have needed you so long
but i just can't keep holdin' on
she never meant to come back home
if she did, she never did say so to daddy
tag:
momma's gone
good bye to daddy"
"chorus:
to know know know him
is to love love love him
just to see him smile
makes my life worthwhile
to know know know him
is to love love love him
and i do
i'll be good to him
i'll bring love to him
everyone says there'll come a day
when i'll walk alongside of him
yes just to know him
is to love love love him
and i do
why can't he see
how blind can he be
someday he will see
that he was meant for me

you and i have been together for a long long time
and we vowed that we would stay together always
life at times has been unpleasant down the trails where fate had led us
but we pray that god will let us be together always
together together together always you and me
forever and ever together always you and me
throught the years our love will multiply and be divided
by the children added to enrich our lives

and as faithful as the stars that grace the night
as constant as the sun in its journey to the heavens

paint a pretty rainbow in the sky
together you and i belong like a songbird and a song
that's why we will always be together you and i
life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
and as happy as the laughter of a child
as peaceful as a river as lasting as forever
that's why we will always be together you and i
together you and i can stop the rain...
together you and i can stop the rain..."

take my hand and run with me out of the past called yesterday
and walk with me into the future of tomorrow
yesterday must be forgot no looking back no matter what
there's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow
yesterday is gone gone but tomorrow is forever
no more crying tears leave tracks and mem'ries find their way back
tomorrow's waking let's journey there together
yesterday is gone gone gone but tomorrow is forever
i care not for yesterday i love you as you are today
yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
we must forget the passing time my love for you is the real kind
the kind that won't hurt you no never
yesterday is gone gone gone but tomorrow is forever
yesterday is gone gone gone but tomorrow is forever"

are always speak the home were we once live and
loved now echo with the angry words we speak.
too selfich and too proud to have admit when we know
that we are wrong now it's late to rebuild the home
we're tearing down it's too far gone
to people just existed always talking never listening
to bousy point out each other's faults too see our home
because we didn't try our love just slowly die
to late to be revived it's too far gone
too far gone

were to busy thinking of ourself to think about
each other's needs we salem have a moment for each
other we share a little you and me.

you can do were too far gone

"no matter how you're tempted
don't say yes to me
don't make this night as smooth to lead me on
it's just that i'm so lonely and i need someone
i've been too lonely too long
oh please be strong enough to refuse me
before i let myself do something wrong
for down inside i'm not that kind of woman
i've been too lonely too long
oh please don't take advantage of the situation
for i'm afraid that i'm too weak to resist temptation
when you're used to being loved
it's hard to live alone

i'm not sure of where i've been
but i know i must keep travelin'
till my road comes to an end
i'm out here on my journey,
trying to make the most of it
i'm a puzzle, i must figure out
where all my pieces fit
like a poor wayfaring stranger
that they speak about in song
i'm just a weary pilgrim
trying to find what feels like home
where that is no one can tell me,
am i doomed to ever roam
i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',
i'm just travelin' on
questions i have many, answers but a few
but we're here to learn, the spirit burns,
to know the greater truth
we've all been crucified
and they nailed jesus to the tree
and when i'm born again,
you're gonna see a change in me
god made me for a reason
and nothing is in vain
redemption comes in many shapes
with many kinds of pain
oh sweet jesus if you're listening,
keep me ever close to you
as i'm stumblin', tumblin', wonderin',
as i'm travelin' thru
i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',
i'm just travelin' thru
i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',
i'm just travelin' thru
oh sometimes the road is rugged,
and it's hard to travel on
but holdin' to each other,
we don't have to walk alone
when everything is broken,
we can mend it if we try
we can make a world of difference,
if we want to we can fly
goodbye little children,
goodnight you handsome men
farewell to all you ladies
and to all who knew me when
and i hope i'll see you down the road,
you meant more than i knew
as i was travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin' thru
i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',
i'm just travelin'
drifting like a floating boat
and roaming like the wind
oh give me some direction lord,
let me lean on you
as i'm travelin', travelin', travelin',
thru
i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',
i'm just travelin' thru
i'm just travelin', travelin', travelin',
i'm just travelin' thru

"the man i loved ran a salesman route
selling goods from house to house
now i knew my mama would never stand
for me stepping out with no traveling man
mama bought things that he was a'selling
but mama didn't know and i sure wasn't telling
that behind her back i was making plans
to meet somewhere with that traveling man
oh the traveling man was a good bit older
but a girl needs arms to hold her
mama didn't know 'cause i didn't told her
but mama wouldn't understand
me stepping out with a traveling man
mama didn't allow me a'going courting
and i'd tell lies that i reckon i oughtn't
oh but she'd a'give me the back a' her hand
if she'd a'seen me with that traveling man
so i tell my mama that i reckon i oughta
go to the spring and fetch us some water
what mama didn't know is i had a plan
to meet down there with that traveling man
now i make plans to run away
with that traveling man on a saturday
well saturday's here and here i stand
and there goes my mama with that traveling man
oh that traveling man was a two time lover
he took my love then he took my mother
but i didn't know 'cause mama didn't told me and i don't understand
my mama running off with my traveling man
mama, you know you oughtn't a'done that

"i have chased after rainbows
i've captured one or two
i've reached for the stars
and i have even held a few
i've walked that lonesome valley
topped the mountains, sewed a sky
i've laughed and i have cried
but i have always tried
'cause i've always been a dreamer
and dreams are special things
but dreams are of no value
if they're not equipped with wings
so secure yourself for climbing
make ready for the sky
don't let your chance go by
you'll make it if you try
so try to be the first one up the mountain
the highest flying dreamer in the sky
and try your best to be an inspiration
brothers that are still afraid and shy
and try to make the most of every moment
'cause if you never try you never win
so try each day to try a little harder
and if you fail, get up and try again
you know nothing is impossible
if you can just believe
don't live your life in shackles
when faith can be the key
the winner's one who keeps determination in his eyes
who's not afraid to fly and not afraid to try
so try to be the first one up the mountain
and try to be the first to touch the sky
and don't let somebody tell you, you can't do it
and if they say that, show em it's a lie
and if you fail at first just keep on trying
'cause you are not a failure in god's eyes
so spread your wings and let the magic happen
'cause you'll never really know if you don't try
and the first step is the one that's always hardest
but you'll never really know if you don't try
you have to try"
"suppose you wanted someone the way i want you
just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in two
walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal

i saw you with your new love and oh it hurt me so
funny how i see your face everywhere i go
you smiled and looked to be so happy as you passed by
so i hurried around the corner so you wouldn't see me cry
suppose you wanted someone the way i want you
just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in too
walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal
just try being lonely, then you know just how i feel
just try being lonely, then you know just how i feel"

i see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
the mem'ry made that day i could never put away
that's the day he told me he'd be mine
and that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
and i have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
and the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
and the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
springtime i recall was the sweetest time of all
that's the season our hearts became entwine
and that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
his love was the wild and restless kind
when he left he left with me so many memories
he left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
he left them hanging on my mind"

we never love each other we're just passing off the time
wasting love yours and mine
wasting love love divine wasting love yours and mine
there's nothing left between us just the ties that bind
wasting love yours and mine wasting love
we just might find happiness with somebody new
for all the love we're wasting surely could be used
not long ago our love was so true and kind
now it's been wasted yours love and mine
wasting love love divine...
wasting love yours and mine wasting love"
"your gentle body lying here so close to me as you move your hand slowly cross my face
your touch is as soft as the words you speak to me for the love in the way i see you
i compare it with the beauty in the dawning
or when the sunset paints its picture in the blue
like a butterfly that has a million colors oh such beauty
like the love in the way i see you
i compare it with the beauty..."
"i am a poor wayfaring stranger
while traveling thru this world of woe
yet there's no sickness, toil or danger
in that bright world yo which i go
i'm going there to see my father
i'm going there no more to ram
i'm only going over jordan
i'm only going over home
i know dark clouds will gather around me
i know my way is rough and steep
yet beauteous fields lie just before me
where god's redeedmed their vigils keep
i'm going there to my mother
she said she'd meet me when i come
i'm only going over jordan
i'm only going over me"
"lately we're acting as if we were strangers
for a moment with each other we don't take time
with our work and busy schedules of things we think important
seems we've left the most important things behind
and we can't let this happen to us the hills that we climb may seem rough
and the mountains between could shadow our dreams
and we can't let this happen to us
we can't let this happen to us we must cherish each smile and tender touch
for the castles we've built could all crumble to dust
and we can't let this happen to us no we can't let this happen to us"

we've been a searchin' for the love that lost its feeling
that one time filled our hearts with fire with love revealing
we thought that love had gone never more to be returning
and the fire that we thought had gone out again is brightly burning
oh we found it oh we found it yes we found it yeah we found it
joy to love joy to love we found it
and the lights are way down low the fire of love is high
we found it yes we found it oh we found it oh we found it
sweet love you and i
well i never seen a lovelight shine so bright no wonder we found it
shining like a neon light with love all around it
it's nights like this with love's sweet bliss sprinkled all around it
we cried a while but now we smiled hmm hmm we found it
oh we found it...
oh we found it..."

"it wasn't very long ago
we had a love few people know
and everything was going oh so fine
i trusted you, you trusted me
the way that it's supposed to be
but love slipped from us somewhere down the line
we had all of the good things going baby
you know we did, everything was fine
enjoying the taste of the good life
we all look for but few can find
it's gone but we can't understand
how luck could slip right through our hands
all down the line things seemed so very right
the love we shared through all these years
we both knew that we were sincere
then suddenly it left just overnight
we had all of the good things going baby
you know we did, everything was fine
enjoying the taste of the good life
we all look for but few can find
now that we've gone our separate ways
i still recall those brighter days
days that didn't seem so very long
neither of us ought to blame
we overly know that it's a shame
and all that we had going now is gone
we had all of the good things going baby
you know we did, everything was fine
enjoying the taste of the good life
we all look for but few can find"
"i can hear the wind a blowin' in my mind
just the way it use to sound through the georgia pines
you were always there to answer when i'd call
you and me, we had it all
remember how i use to touch your hair
reaching for the feeling that was always there
you were the best thing in my life, i can recall
you and me, we had it all
i know that we can never live those times again
but i let my dreams take me back to where we've been
and i stay there with you just as long as i can
oh it was so good
it was so good
it was so good when you were my man
but i'll never stop believing in your smile
even though you didn't stay, it was all worth while
you were the best thing in my life i can recall
you and me, we had it all
i know that we could never get that far again
so i let these memories take me on back to where we've been
and i stay there with you just as long as i can
oh it was so good, it really was
it was so good, oh oh
it was so good when you were my man
you were the best thing in my life i can recall
you and me, we had it all"
"i love you, i love you
my heart seems to whisper
but my lips cannot form those words
i know my heart
is calling out to you
in a voice you've already heard
does your heart feel as if
it could burst any second
is it racing, will not slow up
do you just want to be
with me endlessly
well i'm thinking
we might be in love
we might be in love
the best i can tell
i thinkin' thoughts
that i've never pondered
and i'm feeling like i've never felt
it's like i drink
from some magic posion
sipping from your loving cup
intoxicated, infatuated
i'm thinking we might be in love
we might be in love
what else could it be
these feelings of wonder
passion and romance
excitement and pure ectasy
we might be in love
and it might be forever
i think there's a future for us
if you just want to be
in and all over me
it might be, we might be in love
i promise for keeps
if you're feeling like me
then it might be
we might be in love
i dare say
we might be in love"

then you went away
leaving me with the memories we made
memories of those sweet yesterdays
spent with you
spent with you
and even though you're gone
i still think so often of you
and the things that we no longer do
like we used to

we used to laugh and plan and dream

why must thou be opposed to me

when glory bells chime, my love will ring true
heaven and earth shall pass away, but my love will be yours always
whenever forever comes, when all things are said and done
i'll still be feeling the same way i do
i'll be there for you and still wanting you
god gave you to me, and me to you
and you will still be the one whenever forever comes
we'll float on a cloud through eternity
you'll gather the stars, you'll give them to me
i'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
whenever forever comes, whenever forever comes
what would i have ever done had i not had you to love?
you've given me more than i ever dreamed
loving you more every day, so it seems
greater than all other loves i have seen
its essence will linger on whenever forever comes
we'll float on a cloud through eternity
you'll gather the stars, you'll give them to me
i'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
whenever forever comes, whenever forever comes"
"she stands before the mirror
smiles at her reflection
striking sexy poses in the glass
she paints her lips a brilliant red
piles her hair high on her head
struggles to replace a false eyelash
she powders up her face
paints her cheeks to match her lips
she wears a dress cut low in the front
fittin?tight around her hips
and there inside her room
she stands and gazes at herself
where beauty lives in memory
she lives in fairy tales
chorus:
mirror, mirror on the wall
whoæš¯ the fairest of them all
she sings as she goes waltzing?cross the floor
she keeps a candle burning
and she waits for his returning
when beauty lives in memory
it lives forevermore
she was a fairy princess once
and was by all adored
they say she was the fairest of them all
they called her cinderella
and they say that every fella
would gladly answer to her beck and call
so the story went
they tell of how this handsome prince
stole her heart and wandered far away
he took her heart and took her mind
now she has lost all track of time
forty years has passed and still she waits singing
repeat chorus
meanwhile back inside her room
the shads are pulled itæš¯ half past noon
but in her mind why itæš¯ forty years ago
she recalls the beauty of their love
she remembers he was beautiful
and of course she always knew she was
and so the past unfolds
and all at once inside her mind
she sees him at the door
and as heæš¯ leading her away
she feels the room begin to sway
where beauty lives in memory
she falls dead upon the floor

the dirt was clay and was the color of the blood in me
a twelve acre farm on a ridge is southern tennessee
we left that sweat all over that land behind a mule we watched grow old
row after row trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass wonâ€™t
grow
there was one old store in the hollow we all called town
it belonged to a gentle old man named henry brown
he gave us credit in the wintertime so we could live through the cold when the
wind brought snow
trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass wonâ€™t grow
the one i loved walked through those fields with me
she was a hard working woman true as one could be
but then one year death was going â€˜round and swiftly took itâ€™s toll
janie had to go
now she lies asleep under ground so poor that grass wonâ€™t grow
as i stand here looking over this part of tennessee
the fields are bare as far as the eye can see
and over the grave where janie lies thereâ€™s a beautiful sight to behold
and no one knows why thereâ€™s flowers blooming on ground so poor that grass
wonâ€™t grow"

and i was as wild, even wilder than they
for at least i could run, they just died in the sun
and i refused to just wither in place
just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
so i ran fearing not where i'd go
when a flower grows wild, it can always survive
wildflowers don't care where they grow
and the flowers i knew in the fields where i grew
were content to be lost in the crowd
they were common and close, i had no room for growth
i wanted so much to branch out
i uprooted myself from home ground and left
took my dreams and i took to the road
when a flower grows wild, it can always survive
wildflowers don't care where they grow
i grew up fast and wild and i never felt right
in a garden so different from me
i just never belonged, i just longed to be gone
so the garden, one day, set me free
hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
i just let him decide where we'd go

wildflowers don't care where they grow

wonder if he wants me

and you come walking in
i will be there just waiting for you
cause you can't make old friends
cause you can't make old friends
when i am out on the stage all alone
and i hear the music begin
we all know the show must go on
but you can't make old friends
you can't make old friends
can't make old friends
and you and me, will be young again
you can't make old friends
you and me, will be together again
cause we both know, we will still be old friends
you can't make old friends
not the way we have always been"
"oh you said you were my baby
now i know that you're my baby
but it seems to be you got roamin' eyes
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
you can't keep your finger in two different lives
i remember how you pleaded
when my love you said you needed
and i believe without a doubt
so if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
and keep those kissin' cousins out
oh you know how when i said i was a'rollin' low?
i get suspicious and i'm a'gonna tell you so
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
and be nobody's baby but mine
just think about it
now i heard there was another
so i went and asked your mother
if anybody hung around besides me
she gave me no satisfaction
and now i can't take no action
but i think i'll hang around and see
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
you gotta come to me and tell me so
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
i'm tired of waitin' around so let them know
oh how when i said that i'm a rollin low
i'm gunna get suspicious and i'm gunna tell you so
if you wanna be my baby
then you gotta be my baby
and be nobody's baby but mine
i said and be nobody's baby but mine
and i mean it!"
"to you i may never be more than a friend
but you'll always be special to me
to you i may never be closer than i am
but you'll always be special to me
maybe i set my sights too high to be real
i may be wrong, but love is strong
and i can't hide how i feel
to you i may never be closer than i am
but you'll always be special to me
maybe i set my sights too high to be real
but love is strong, i may be wrong
but i can't hide how i feel
to you i may never be closer than i am
but you'll always be special to me"
"chorus:
you'll never be the sun turning in the sky
and you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night
and you won't be the stars in heaven
although they burn so bright
but even on the deepest ocean
you will be the light
you may not always shine
as you go barefoot over stone
you might be so long together
or you might walk alone
and you won't find that love comes easy
but that love is always right
so even when the dark clouds gather
you will be the light
and if you lose the part inside
when loves turns round on you
leaving the past behind
is knowing you'll do like you always do
holding you blind, keeping you true
repeat chorus"
"some day you're gonna want me but i ain't gonna be around
some day you'll find you miss the kiss that you're forever turnin' down
when you decide you want the love that once you could've had
well that's gonna be to bad and you're gonna be sorry
you're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
all the nights you stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
while you were busy makin' out, i was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
and when you find this out, you're gonna be sorry
you'll wake up cryin for me like i've done so many nights for you
you'll walk the floor and you'll call my name but i ain't gonna hear you
you'll curse the night and you'll hate yourself for ever doin' me wrong
but i'm gonna be long gone and you're gonna be sorry
you're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
all the nights you've stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
while you were busy makin' out, i was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
and when you find i'm gone, you're gonna be sorry
you're gonna be sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry"
"i found out the hard way
and i'm never gonna break your heart
i know, too late
and i don't want to break your heart
guess i had to go away just to find
what i left behind
you're the only one
you're the only one
take me back
to where we started from
and let's make it now
like we made it then
this ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
nights i lay in bed
and your covers wouldn't warm my feet
and morning found me
bitter or a bit too sweet
oh baby, i had to go away
just to run back and say
you're the only one
you're the only one
take me back
to where we started from
can we make it now
like we made it then
this ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
you're the only one darlin'
they'll never be anyone else but you
i love you so much
you are my love, you've become my life
and i never meant to break your heart
but, sometimes, you just got to go away
to find what you left behind
you're the only one
you're the only one
take me back
to where we started from
can we make it now
like we make it then
this ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
you're the only one
you're the only one
you're the only one
the only one
so take me back
to where we started from
you're the only one
the only one
you're the only one
you 're the only one
the only one
take me back
to where we started from
fade:
you're the only one
the only one
you're the only one
you're the only one
the only one"
"you never close your eyes anymore when i kiss your lips
and there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
you're trying hard not to show it, baby
but baby, baby i know it
you've lost that lovin' feeling
whoa, that lovin' feeling
you've lost that lovin' feeling
now it's gone, gone, gone, woah
now there's no welcome look in your eyes when i reach for you
and now your're starting to critisize little things i do
it makes me just feel like crying, baby
'cause baby, something in you is dying
you lost that lovin' feeling
whoa, that lovin' feeling
you've lost that lovin' feeling
now it's gone, gone, gone, woah
baby, baby, i get down on my knees and pray to you
if you would only love me like you used to do
we had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday
so don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away
bring back that lovin' feeling
oh, that lovin' feeling
bring back that lovin' feeling
now it's gone, gone, gone
and i can't go on, woah
you've lost the lovin' feeling
woah, that lovin' feeling
you've lost the lovin' feeling
now it's gone, gone, gone
fade:
bring back that lovin' feeling, bring it on back
woah, that lovin' feeling
you've lost that lovin' feeling
now it's gone, gone, gone"
"last night you breathed the deepest sigh
turned away with those gold cold cool eyes
you said won't you give me space to breathe
but my tears gave you confidence to leave
now you say i'm just too much for you
there are things you'll never know
if you lie and cheat so easily
ya better go, you better go
go, go, go, you better go
all i know is how i feel
and my heart is always yours to steal
but you take and never give to me
your kisses are charity
your kisses are charity
yesterday you were my brightest star
but even when you're near
i don't know where you are
i was wrong to show my weaker side
now it's much too late to cry, cry, cry
i was blind to put my trust in you
if you leave me, i'll fall apart
did you plan to make a fool out of me
from the start, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
all i know is how i feel
and my heart was always yours to steal
but you take and never give to me
your kisses are charity
your kisses are charity
now you say i'm too much for you
there are things you'll never know
if you lie and cheat so easily
ya better go, you better go
go, go, go, you better go
all i know is how i feel
and my heart was always yours to steal
but you take and never give to me
your kisses are charity
you never give to me
all i know is how i feel
and my heart was always yours to steal
but you take but never give to me
your kisses are charity
your kisses are charity"

"i have to mow the lawn
and i have to wash the car
and i'd just like to know
just who you think you are
i'm gettin' tired of wagging
that old heavy garbage can
your woman's gettin' tired
of being your ole handy man
i have to run your water
and i have to wash your back
and i have to scrub the tub
after you have had your bath
you're as helpless as a baby
but i love you, understand
i'm just gettin' tired
of being your ole handy man
your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
now i know you've got ten fingers
but where's your helpin' hand
i've just made a decision
i've stood all i'm gonna stand
your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
i do everything for you
you never help yourself
an' i think i'd die from shock
if you raised a hand to help
well, i'm not gonna keep it up
that's what you got planned
your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
now i know you got ten fingers
but where's that helpin' hand
i've just made a decision
i've stood all i'm gonna stand
your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man

your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man"

may the fruit of my toil be yours love
may the food from my soil be yours love
and from this moment on may a love that is strong
that lives on and on be yours love
may the sons that i raise be yours love
may the comforts i praise be yours love
if i ever get weak may the love words i speak
and the arms that i seek be yours love
may the lord's shining grace be yours love
may the happiest face be yours love
may the last fingertips that touch these two lips
as life from me slips be yours love
and from this moment on may a love that is strong
that lives on and on be yours love"
