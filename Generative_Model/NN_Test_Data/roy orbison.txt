"darkness falls and she will take me by the hand
take me to some twilight land
where all but love is grey
where i can't find my way
without her as my guide
night falls i'm cast beneath her spell
daylight comes our heaven's turns to hell
am i left to burn
and burn eternally
she's a mystery to me
she's a mystery girl
she's a mystery girl
in the night of love words tangled in her hair
words soon to disappear
a love so sharp it cut like switchblade to my heart
words tearing me apart
she tears again my bleeding heart
i want to run she's pulling me apart
fallen angel cries
and i just melt away
she's a mystery to me
she's a mystery girl
she's a mystery girl
she's a mystery girl
haunted by her side it's the darkness in her eyes
that so enslaves me
but if my love is blind then i don't want to see
she's a mystery to me
night falls i'm cast beneath her spell
daylight comes our heaven's turns to hell
am i left to burn
and burn eternally
she's a mystery girl
she's a mystery girl
she's a mystery girl
she's a mystery girl
she's a mystery girl

maybe i should have called you first, but i was dying to get to you
i was dreaming while i drove the long straight road ahead
uh huh, yeah
could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
this fever for you was just burning me up deep inside
i drove all night to get to you
is that all right?
i drove all night, crept in your room
woke you from your sleep
to make love to you
is that all right?
i drove all night
what in this world keeps us from falling apart?
no matter where i go i hear the beating of our one heart
i think about you when the night is cold and dark
uh huh, yeah
no one can move me the way that you do
nothing erases this feeling between me and you
chorus
to taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
this fever for you is just burning me up inside
i drove all night to get to you
is that all right?
i drove all night, crept in your room
is that all right?
i drove all night"
"i was all right for a while
i could smile for a while
then i saw you last night
you held my hand so tight
and you stopped.. to say hello
you wished me well
you couldn't tell
that i've been crying over you,
crying over you
and you said so long
left me standing all alone,
alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
it's hard to understand
but the touch of your hand
can start me crying
i thought that i was over you...but it's true, so true
i love you even more than i did before
but darling, what can i do?
for you don't love me
and i'll always be
crying over you, crying over you
yes now you're gone
and from this moment on, i'll be
crying, crying, crying, crying
yeah, crying, crying over you"
"barry gibb/larry gatlin
you were a lady   like lady i was a boy running wild
the way that you used everything that god gave you
i gave you my heart like a child, one moment you took me to heaven
took me back to earth and then before i woke up to the fact i was small you took me back to heaven again
and i remember the indian summer how you held me, how you loved me 
the world may give me a million reasons but reasons don't make it wrong
every lesson i learned has a price in return i was lost in my youth and to tell you the truth
i was empty and you filled me with a glow of love a loving loves may die
just to hear you that sees me through, oh what i'd give to re live all the indian summers with you
so many hearts have been broken you had no trouble with mine like a fool i was there for the taking it was only a matter of time you can lie in the sun with the warm wind blowing
just knowing you've already paid but you can't live alone in an indian summer at 110 in the shade
and i remember  the indian summer
how you held me in the moonlight
we were riding along on a silver dream never dreaming it off our head
and if i'd known i'd lose you the moment i found you i'd love you all over again
cos i'm still empty  come fill me with a fire of love your flame will follow flame cos it's all i want to do
oh what i'd give to re live all the indian summers with you
oh what i'd give to re live all the indian summers with you
oh what i'd give to re live all the indian summers with you
oh what i'd give to re live all the indian summers with you oooooooooooooooooo"

recant some bits of poetry
you'll find the words still ring true
some things don't change
some things do
and you're the only one with a broken heart
the only one who's afraid of the dark
the only one in a crowded room
the only one who sees the blue moon
what you wouldn't give right now
to be another face in the crowd
and you're the only one who is all alone
the only one whose love is gone
the only one who has given in
the only one who will give again
and you're the only one with a broken heart
the only one who's afraid of the dark
the only one in a crowded room
the only one who sees the blue moon"

tonight down here in the valley
i'm lonesome and oh, how i feel
as i sit here alone in my cabin
i can see your mansion on the hill
do you remember when we parted?
the story to me you revealed
you said you could live without love, dear
in your loveless mansion on the hill
i've waited all through the years. love
to give you a heart true and real
cos i know you are living in sorrow
in your loveless mansion on the hill
the light shines bright from your window
the trees stand so silent and still
i know you're alone with your pride, dear
in your loveless mansion on the hill"

the evening sun is falling that old blue moon is calling
my guardian angel in the sky came through
to help all my dreams come true there's a new star.
there's a new star coming tonight, there's a new love burning
so bright for a new star of love is born between the earth and sky
for you and i.
there's a new star
the moon was dull, the sky was cold and gray
there were no stars to light my lonely way
and then i traced the lovelight in your eyes
to a new star twinkling in the sky burning bright, day and night
now i'm alright, now we're together, lovers forever
a new star, a new star to light our way
there's a new star burning for us, there's a new world turning for us
there's a new star sparkling in the sky.
there's a new star shining somewhere and we know the reason why
there's a new star way up there for a true love
a new star for our love will never die."

a young couple stood under stars in the sky
they pledged their love with tears in their eyes
for this was a true love goodbye
they stood there trembling and couldn't speak
she tip toed and kissed his cheek
for this was a true love goodbye
a true love goodbye, they tried not to cry
with words so true, they both said ""i love you""
then they parted both broken hearted
but they'll meet again some day some way
beyond this true love goodbye
a true love goodbye, they tried not to cry
with words so true, they both said ""i love you""
then they parted both broken hearted
but they'll meet again some day some way
beyond this true love goodbye
true love, true love goodbye
bye my love...."
"the night is still the wind is chilled
i hear the rain falling on my window pane
can't close my eyes, afraid to sleep
cause when i do i would only dream of you
i'm trying to forget that we ever met
but how can i forget and dream of you?
afraid to sleep because i'd dream of you
afraid to sleep because i'd wake up feeling blue
if i stay awake forever,we'd never be together
so i'll close my eyes and go ahead and dream
sweet dreams
sweet dreams
sweer dreams...."

this feeling seems so strong.
after the love, after the love has gone.

each time i hear some poor girl cry
see the tears in her eyes
it always breaks my heart in two
when there's nothing i can do for her
she's just another lonely girl
if i could take them one by one
and teach them how to have lots of fun
make them fall in love with me
mmm mmm, there'd never be another lonely girl
another lonely girl, another lonely girl
mmm mmm, there'd never be another lonely girl
now it's not fair that they should cry
and be so all alone
love should treat them tenderly
never treat them wrong
ooh no, there should never be another lonely girl
i know how it feels to love someone
i know how it feels to part
so if some lonely girl gives me her heart
i'll never break her heart
oh no, she'll never be another lonely girl

"written by orbison/melson.
when evening shadows fall.
iâ€™m not lonely at all.
now that youâ€™re with me i recall.
how much i love you.
close again.
now iâ€™m alright, tonight weâ€™re close again.
touching your hand means that weâ€™re close again.
reaching each other now within
at last weâ€™re two are really close again.
how long has it been since we loved like this?,
i'll never ever know.
it seems like only yesterday.
yet it seems so long ago.
close again.
down deep inside weâ€™re both are close again.
a love that died can be alive again.
i can survive because youâ€™ve let me in.
into your heart so very close again.
so love me,like you loved me when you loved me,
and say thatâ€™s all you want to do.
i am what i am,and all that i am.
is in love with you,and only you.
so close again.
thatâ€™s all that matter,weâ€™re close again.
dreams that were scattered are close again.
hearts that were shattered begin to mend.
canâ€™t help but cry.
for you and i are close again."

i tried so hard my dear to show
that you're my every dream
yet you're afraid each thing i do
is just some evil scheme
a memory from your lonesome past
keeps us so far apart
why can't i free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold cold heart?
another love before my time
made your heart sad and blue
and so my heart is paying now
for things i didnt do
in anger unkind words are said
that makes the teardrops start
why can't i free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold cold heart?
there was a time when i believed
that you belonged to me
but now i know your heart is shackled
to a memory
the more i learn to care for you
the more we drift apart
why can't i free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold cold heart?"

and then we'd steal away
from the crowd and the dance to our hideaway

it's no secret you'll feel better if you cry

and your blues keep getting bluer with each song
remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
so let your hair down and go on and cry"

rhythm and rhyme and harmony
you help me along makin' me strong"
"sadness slips into the room
on silent steps of sorrow
stealing sleep and all my dreams
where will we be tomorrow?
lying with you, crying with you, drifting
talking till dawn yet we go on, drifting
don't understand where we began just drifting apart
drifting apart feeling alone drifting away
we can't seem to work it out
drifting from day to day
wasn't it all about, drifting away
drifting away, drifting away
losing the feeling
and now the music of the song is almost gone
that we used to play
from sweet surrender from drifting away, drifting
two lovers lost two rivers crossed, drifting
two bridges burned, no lesson learned, drifting
lonely together, hurting each other
still we can't say that it's over
can we bring back yesterday?
will we be forever, forever drifting away
drifting, drifting away"

and then fade away in the winter
when the cold winds begin to blow
but when it's evergreen, evergreen
it will last through the summer and winter too
when love is evergreen, evergreen
like my love for you
so hold my hand and tell me
you'll be mine through laughter or through tears

it will last through the summer and winter too

'cos you're the best friend that i could ever know
being taught the words from you .... from what is true
someone to share the pain that i'm going through
and it's a heavy load that i bear and it's a heavy crown that i wear
as i travel down this road, it's a heavy load, it's a heavy load
it's a heavy load that i bear and it's a heavy crown that i wear
so help me one more time, it's such an uphill climb
as i travel down this road, it's a heavy load
lord it's a heavy load, lord it's a heavy load, lord it's a heavy load
lord it's a heavy load, lord it's a heavy load...."

help! i need somebody.
help! not just anybody.
help! you know i need someone.
help!
when i was younger, so much younger than today,
i never needed anybody&acute;s help in any way.
but now these days are gone i&acute;m not so self assured,
now i find
i&acute;ve changed my mind, i&acute;ve opened up the doors.
help me if you can, i&acute;m feeling down,
and i do appreciate you being &acute;round.
help me get my feet back on the ground.
won&acute;t you please, please help me?
and now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
my independence seems to vanish in the haze.
but every now and then i feel so insecure,
i know that i just need you like i&acute;ve never done before.
help me if you can, i&acute;m feeling down,
and i do appreciate you being &acute;round.
help me get my feet back on the ground.
won&acute;t you please, please help me?

morning comes into my room, through pretty purple curtains
and looks upon a man so satisfied, i hold a woman in my arms
and watch her while she's sleeping, and i know that i'm the man on suzie's mind
i'm the pretty dress she buys, i'm the little bug she drives
i'm the picture that she shows to everybody that she knows
i'm the wiggle in her walk, i'm the giggle in her talk
i'm the happy little song she sings, she wears my love for all to see
sail on by, silver moon, i won't follow you this time
i've got heaven in my arms tonight, i'm the man on suzie's mind
i'm the stops on her way home, i'm the dime in the telephone
i'm the honey that she talks about, i'm the old meanie when she pouts
i'm the carpet, need her feet every night before she sleeps
i'm the pillow where she lays her head, i'm the last word that she said

"there once was an indian brave by the name of yellow hand
he fell in love with a maiden know as white sands
they vowed their love would last forever more
then came the day that they had waited for.
yellow hand brought her a golden feather
white sands said a prayer for good weather
the ceremonial dance grew loud and strong
then yellow hand began their wedding song.
oooooh oooooh oooh ooooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
tonight, tonight, we will be one
we'll walk in the land of the midnight sun
oh white sands, come hold my lonely hand.
then they left the warmth of the raging fire
and rode into the hills climbing higher
and suddenly the snow came swirling down
they were lost the trail could not be found.
oooooh oooooh oooh ooooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
tonight, tonight we will be one
we'll walk in the land of the midnight sun
oh white sands, come hold my lonely hand.
they never returned from paradise
they went to their places in the sky
and the old ones still say when the snowflakes fly
if you'll listen close you'll hear him cry:

we'll walk in the land of the midnight sun
oh white sands, come hold my lonely hand."

the sand and the sea are inseperable
and nothing can take them apart
and that's how you will be, forever with me
inseperable from my heart
the powers that be are unchangeable
and somehow, somewhere are the stars
that can send you to me, and then you will be
inseperable from my heart
like the birds in flight
drifting clouds of white
shining stars at night
are fulfilling their destiny
and so are we
for we are born to be inseperable
and nothing can take us apart
like my heartbeat and me, you will always be
inseparable from my heart
inseperable from my heart"

brings back the memory of your embrace
i start to cry into my lonely wine
teardrops fall but all they bring is heartache
it's better if i never think at all
still they soothe the pain my lonely thoughts make
i never quite succeed in hiding all, so let them fall

when true love is far away it may be yours in memories

try to put me through to her in memphis, tennessee.
yes, oh, yes, long distance, i'll accept the charge. i'll pay.
but which loved one is calling me? i did not hear you say.
both are deep within my heart, her mom and my marie.
it's so good to hear your voice from memphis, tennessee.
oh, you mean so much to me, more than you'll ever know.
surely you have not forgot how much i love you so.
if you would remember, dear, and sometimes talk to me.
maybe that would reunite our home in tennessee.
last time i saw you, just before i had to leave.
you didn't want to see me off, and promised not to grieve.
my heart was torn apart, as i looked back at marie.
and there the pieces still remain with you in tennessee.
i guess i should stop talking, after all, you placed the call.
but any way that i can help. you know i'll help you all.

discovered love i thought could never be
a love as sweet as wine
keeps you off my mind
i said goodbye to my misery
memories will never bother me again
and when i think of things that might have been
i just pledge my love to my new love
and then we kiss again
and oh, what a feeling just to know
that never again, never again, never again
i've found a love to last forever
i true love who will leave me never
never, never, never
never, never, never
never, never, never...."

they take a little freedom each time they let ya touch
she didn't try to chain me that's why i turned around

autumn leaves, when they fall
whisper to the wind, ringing out, telling all
of the summer's end.
now you're gone far away, how i long to hear you say
""i love you.""
whirling leaves, swirling leaves tell me i'm alone
wishing you were here with me longing for you home.
winter nights are lonely nights how i long to hold you tight
i miss you.
a gentle breeze in the trees will tell me spring is here
and i feel anxiety knowing you'll be near.
summer nights, i'll hold you tight
under the moon above you'll be my summer love.

autumn leaves will never come and with me you'll stay
you will mean more to me, yes, you'll be

there's a little bird that somebody sends
down to the earth to live on the wind.
born on the wind and he sleeps on the wind
this little bird that somebody sends.
he's light and fragile and feathered sky blue,
so thin and graceful the sun shines through.
this little bird who lives on the wind,
this little bird that somebody sends.
he flies so high up in the sky
out of reach of human eye.
and the only time that he touches the ground
is when that little bird
is when that little bird
is when that little bird dies."

stood together in an open field
and shared the secrets that the night revealed
then we'd chase the light racing through the sky
can we untangle guilt and innocence?
how hard we torture this ambevolence
night will bring no dawn where's the power gone?
for i'll steal your dreams while you are sleeping
and sell them for dust and cheap lust
and i'll turn your hope while you are weeping
and cover your eyes with sad lies and dark skies
come closer to me, on your hands and knees, alone when your will's gone
how much is not enough?, how much is through?
how long will i be getting over you?
how much grief and sin
till the heart caves in? till the heart caves in?, till the heart caves in?"

another day, another night
another tired old country song
you know, i sing of love delight
but i know it's all wrong
the life i live out on the road
is one i swear no one could love
yet i feel i must go on
and sing this tired
this tired old country song
i move around from place to place
but all the towns look just the same
i see the same old face
losin' still my claim to fame
i'll sing the guitar blues
drink my drink and pay the dues
then i guess i'll ramble on
and sing this tired
this tired old country song
why did i have to compromise
to reach my piece of the fame?
life could have been so different
in that eight to five game
so i guess i'll settle down
get my feet back on the ground
once a country star
now i'm just a country clown
hang my guitar on the wall
i won't need it anymore
for i think the time has come
to end this tired
this tired old country song

when grass was green and grain so yellow

when you were a young and a callow fellow
try to remember and if you remember

that no one wept except the willow
try to remember when life was so tender
that dreams were kept beside your pillow

although you know the snow will follow
deep in december it's nice to remember

"traveling wilburys
tweeter and the monkey man were hard up for cash
they stayed up all night selling cocaine and hash
to an undercover cop who had a sister named jan
for reasons unexplained she loved the monkey man
tweeter was a boy scout before she went to vietnam
and found out the hard way nobody gives a damn
they knew that they found freedom just across the jersey line
so they hopped into a stolen car took highway 99
and the walls came down all the way to hell
never saw them when they're standing
never saw them when they fell
the undercover cop never liked the monkey man
even back in childhood he wanted to see him in the can
jan got married at fourteen to a rackateer named bill
she made secret calls to the monkey man from a mansion on the hill
it was out on thunder road   tweeter at the wheel
they crashed into paradise   they could hear them tires squeal
the undercover cop pulled up and said ""everyone of you's a liar
if you don't surrender now it's gonna go down to the wire
an ambulance rolled up   a state trooper close behind
tweeter took his gun away and messed up his mind
the undercover cop was left tied up to a tree
near the souvenir stand by the old abandoned factory
next day the undercover cop was hot in pursuit
he was taking the whole thing personal
he didn't care about the loot
jan had told him many times it was you to me who taught
in jersey anything's legal as long as you don't get caught
someplace by rahway prison they ran out of gas
the undercover cop had cornered them said ""boy, you didn't
think that this could last""
jan jumped out of bed said ""there's someplace i gotta go""
she took a gun out of the drawer and said ""it's best if you dont' know""
the undercover cop was found face down in a field
the monkey man was on the river bridge using tweeter as a shield
jan said to the monkey man ""i'm not fooled by tweeter's curl
i knew him long before he ever became a jersey girl""
now the town of jersey city is quieting down again
i'm sitting in a gambling club called the lion's den
the tv set been blown up, every bit of it is gone
ever since the nightly news show that the monkey man was on
i guess i'll to to florida and get myself some sun
there ain't no more opportunity here, everything's been done
sometime i think of tweeter, sometime i think of jan
sometime i don't think about nothing but the monkey man"

what now, my love, now that you've left me
how can i live through another day
watching my dreams turning to ashes
and my hopes into bits of clay
once i could see, once i could feel
now i am numb, i've become unreal
i walk the night without a goal
stripped of my heart, my soul
what now, my love, now that it's over
i feel the world closing in on me
here come the stars tumbling around me
there's the sky where the sea should be
what now, my love, now that you've gone
i'd be a fool to go on and on
no one would care, no one would cry
if i should live or die
what now, my love, now there is nothing
only my last goodbye"
"when i stop dreaming that's when i'll stop loving you

and asked me if i could forget
when i stop dreaming that's when i'll stop loving you

you may take a pebble and teach it to grow

the good times are all gone
the night keeps coming on so strong
you can't hold on, no matter what you do
will there be someone who cares for you
when the blue hour comes?
when the blue hour comes?
and when your restless heart
tears your world apart
and everywhere you turn
it's falling down on you
will there be a light that shines for you?
when the blue hour comes for you
if there's anything that you would have me do
just call on me and i'll be coming through
i will always be there for you
when the blue hour comes
when the blue hour comes
good times don't last forever
sometimes it's now or never
darling, reach out for me
you know where i'll be
i will always be there for you
when the blue hour comes
when the blue hour comes
when the blue hour comes for you
if there's anything that you would have me do
just call on me and i'll be coming through
i will always be there for you
when the blue hour comes

i will always be there

well i love this business, it's been good to me
i've got a different shirt to wear every day can't you see?
the crowds, they respond to me they got my tickets
and you know my pictures ain't free, so i'm asking you, i really wanna know
where does all the money go?
well i dig applause, yeah, i get high from that sound
i got roadies, tailors, barbers and bodyguards hangin' round
i got a top rated tv show, they play my records on the radio
but won't you tell me true, there's one thing i've got to know
where does all the money go?
i got expired credit cards, a pool in my back yard
i bought myself a lot of friends, i got a mortgage on a mansion
and a mid waist expansion and at forty the fun begins
i love this business but it might be the death of me
i've endorsed a lot of products but you don't get me name for free
i'm not really hard to please, just gimme top billing in every press release
and i'm asking you, just listen to my show, where does all the money go?
well i'll be in this business till i'm under the old oak tree
and the folks will pay a lot of their money just to walk over me
i've got a hungry agent, gets a gig in every nation, and he books for my nominal fee
well i never saw any cash, but i know somewhere there's got to be one hell of a stash
and the epitaph i want on my headstone is ""where did all the money go?"""

i can nearly touch the sky zig zag zig zag
pass it on by
you have got my heart turned on
why don't you push it on ahead
till your heart turns on
you've got love and our lovin' is dead
instead of wishing for the knowing zig zag
the way you got me going zig zag
i'm so glad you caught my eye zig zag zig zag
pass it on by
you have got my heart turned on
why don't you push it on ahead
till your heart turns on
you've got love and our lovin' is dead
instead of wishing for the knowing zig zag
the way you got me going zig zag
i'm so glad you caught my eye zig zag zig zag
pass it on by
pass it on by.........8 times"
"tom petty
all down the street they're standin in line
with white lipstick and one thing on their mind
hey little freak with the lunch pail purse
underneath the paint you're just a little girl
dancin at the zombie zoo, dancin at the zombie zoo
painted in a corner and all you wanna do
is dance down at the zombie zoo
cute little dropout, how come you pack a rod?
is your mother in a clinic? has your father got no job?
sometimes you're so impulsive you shaved off all your hair
you look like boris karloff and you don't even care
you're dancin at the zombie zoo dancin at the zombie zoo
she disappears at sunrise, i wonder where she goes until
the night comes fallin down again she shows
up with her friends half alive
you can make a big impression or go through life unseen
you might wind up restricted and over seventeen
it's so hard to be careful, so easy to be led
somewhere beyond the pavement you'll find the living dead"
