"intro: nas
yeah yeah, aiyyo black it's time yeah, it's time man yeah, straight out the f***in dungeons of rap
where fake n****z don't make it back
i don't know how to start this shit, yo, now
verse one: nas
rappers i monkey flip em with the funky rhythm i be kickin
musician, inflictin composition
of pain i'm like scarface sniffin cocaine
holdin a m 16, see with the pen i'm extreme, now
bulletholes left in my peepholes
i'm suited up in street clothes
hand me a nine and i'll defeat foes
y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
i keep some e&j, sittin bent up in the stairway
or either on the corner bettin grants with the celo champs
laughin at baseheads, tryin to sell some broken amps
g packs get off quick, forever n****z talk shit
remeniscing about the last time the task force flipped
n****z be runnin through the block shootin
time to start the revolution, catch a body head for houston
once they caught us off guard, the mac 10 was in the grass and
i ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
pick the mac up, told brothers, ""back up,"" the mac spit
lead was hittin n****z one ran, i made him backflip
heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn't look
gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my shit is stuck
try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot now i'm in danger
finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
so now i'm jetting to the building lobby
and it was filled with children probably couldn't see as high as i be
 it's like the game ain't the same
got younger n****z pullin the triggers bringing fame to they name
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
in broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us
fo' fives and gauges, macs in fact
same n****z'll catch a back to back, snatchin yo' cracks in black
there was a snitch on the block gettin n****z knocked
so hold your stash until the coke price drop
i know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock
and if it's good she'll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo
you gotta slide on a vacation
inside information keeps large n****z erasin and they wives basin
it drops deep as it does in my breath
i never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
i think of crime when i'm in a new york state of mind
verse two: nas
be havin dreams that i'ma gangster    drinkin moets, holdin tecs
makin sure the cash came correct then i stepped
investments in stocks, sewein up the blocks
to sell rocks, winnin gunfights with mega cops
but just a n****, walking with his finger on the trigger
make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin
give me a smith and wessun i'll have n****z undressin
thinkin of cash flow, buddah and shelter
whenever frustrated i'ma hijack delta
in the p.j.'s, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
young b****es is grazed each block is like a maze
full of black rats trapped, plus the island is packed
from what i hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black
i'm livin where the nights is jet black
the fiends fight to get crack i just max, i dream i can sit back
and lamp like capone, with drug scripts sewn
or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
i got so many rhymes i don't think i'm too sane
life is parallel to hell but i must maintain
and be prosperous, though we live dangerous
cops could just arrest me, blamin us, we're held like hostages
it's only right that i was born to use mics
and the stuff that i write, is even tougher than dice
i'm takin rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
my rhymin is a vitamin, hell without a capsule
the smooth criminal on beat breaks
never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
the city never sleeps, full of villians and creeps
that's where i learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks
i'ma addict for sneakers, twenties of buddah and b****es with beepers
in the streets i can greet ya, about blunts i teach ya
inhale deep like the words of my breath
i never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
i lay puzzle as i backtrack to earlier times
nothing's equivalent, to the new york state of mind"

we got to flee to panama, but wait it's half and half
keys is one and two fifth, so how we flip
thirty two grams raw, chop it in half, get sixteen, double it times three
we got forty eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
we back to sixteen, now add the other two that 'mega bringin through
so let's see, if we flip this other key
then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
plus a five hundred, cut in half is two fifty
now triple that times three, we got three quarters of another key"
"verse one:
what up kid? i know shit is rough doing your bid
when the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
f*** it black, no time for looking back it's done
plus congratulations you know you got a son
i heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
flip it, talk about he acts too rough
he didn't listen he be riffin' while i'm telling him stuff
i was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
f***ing with the n****z from that fake crew that hate you
but yo, guess who got shot in the dome piece?
jeromes niece, on her way home from joes beaches club
plus little rob is selling drugs all the time
hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9's
at night time there's more trife than ever
whattup with cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
if so then hold the fort, now i represent to the fullest
say whassup to herb, ice and bullet
i left a half a hundred in your commisary
you was my n**** when push came to shove
one what? one love
verse two:
dear born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
out in new york the same shit is going on
the crack heads stalking, loud mouths is talking
hold, check out the story yesterday when i was walking
the n**** you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something
word to mother, i heard him fronting
and he be pumping on your block
your man gave him your glock
and now they run together, what up son, whatever
since i'm on the streets i'm a put it to a cease
when i heard you blew a n**** with the  for a phone piece
whylin' on the island but now with better chill 'cos them n****z will put that ass on fire
last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
i maintain when you come home the corner's ours
on the reels, all these crab n****z know the deal
when we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
but chill, see you on the next v i
i gave your mom dukes loot for kicks
plus  flicks
your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me
he might beat his case, 'til he come home i play it low key
so stay civilised, time flies
though incarcerated your mind i hate it when your mum cries
it kinda wants to make me murder, for real a
i've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs
for one love
verse three:
sometimes i sit back with a budda sack
mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
written in school text books, bibles, etcetera
f*** a school lecture, the lies get me vexed er
so i be ghost from my projects
i take my pen and pad for the week and hittin' nails while i'm sleeping
a two day stay, you may say i need the time alone
to relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
you see the streets have me stressed something terrible
f***ing with the corners have a n**** up in belle vue
or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
a future in a maximum state pen is grim
so i comes back home, nobody's helping shorty
do i roll them two phillies together and the friends we call them oowops
he said nas, n****z cold be bustin' off the roof
so i wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres deuce
he inhailed so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
started coughing when i peeked to watch me speak
i sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
we was chillin' on these b****es where he pumped his loose cracks
i took an l when he passed it, this little bastard
keeps me blasted he starts talking mad shit
i had to school him, told him don't let n****z fool him
'cos when the pistol blows a shot that's when a murder be the cool one
tough luck when n****z are struck, families f***ed up
could've cought your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
if the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
then i rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
then froze only the bolder herb smoke through my nose
and told my little man that i'm a go cyprose
there's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose
words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above
keep an eye out for jake shorty what"
"it ain't hard to tell, i excel, then prevail
the mic is contacted, i attract clientele
my mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's death
i exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
deep like the shinin', sparkle like a diamond
sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
hit the earth like a comet, invasion
nas is like the afrocentric asian, half man, half amazin
cause in my physical, i can express throuh song
delete stress like motrin, then extend strong
i drank moet with medusa, give her shotguns in hell
from the spliff that i lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell
the buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
nas, stories by aesop, place your loot up, parties i shoot up
nas, i analyze, drop a jew el
inhale from the l, school a fool well, you feel it like braille
it ain't hard to tell, i kick the skill like shaquille holds a pill
vocabulary spills i'm illplus matic, i freak beats slam it like iron shiek
jam like a tech with correct techniques
so analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
scannin while you're plannin ways to sabatoge me
i leave em froze like her on in your nosenas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell
this rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen
i'll leave your brain stimulated, n****z is frozen
speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
end like leviathan, it's deep well let me try again
wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop
i dominate break loops, givin mics men e straul cycles
street's disciple, i rock beats that's mega trifle
and groovy but smoother than moves by villanova
you're still a soldier, i'm like sly stallone in cobra
packin like a rasta in the weed spotvocals'll squeeze glocks, mc's eavesdropt
though they need not to sneakmy poetry's deep, i never fell
nas's raps should be locked in a cellit ain't hard to tell"
"light it, uhh
light it up, uhh
the whole, city is mine, prettiest don
i don't like the way p. diddy did shyne with different lawyers
why it's mentioned in my rhymes? f*** it, it's just an intro
hate it or love it, like it bump it or dump it
writing, across the stomach spell god son
life is like a jungle black it's like the habitat of tarzan
matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
most of my n****z packed in correctional facilities
half of them passed on, mack strong, couple of shots
may the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin the block
where they used to stand at, somebody's takin they place
a younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
same walk, same talk, i wonder can that be possible
a thug dies, another step inside his shoes
and they will hurt you, layin low with a bottle
i'm blowin circles, my state of mind purple
light it, light it, uhh
yeah.. light it up, light it up, uhh
y'all just wanna deal with drama
talk about n****z who got things, y'all ready to kill his momma
everything you went to is underworld related
you sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
you don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin soldiers
to pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
think of how many dudes died tryin to be down with you
everybody's under six feet of ground but you
still standin, still roamin through the streets, that's real
you a survivor, knowin all the beef is ill
you got a bunch of thugs witchu even now that's ready
trustin your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
the hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day
a bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
that ain't love it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
whose sons you killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?
unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is god
somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holdin a mirror
lookin down a tear in jail, makin weapons to kill ya
we smoke three tokes n**** pour more henny
he sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
cold blooded murderers, universal
hood to hood, blowin smoke, state of mind is purple
light it up, light it up light it up, uhh
light it up.. light it up, light it up, uhh
uhh.. uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh
these hot headed youngsters, always get into trouble
reactin before thinkin, they easily irritated
and murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin
when we should be climbin, in a nutshell, it's just jail
drug sales, liquor and diamonds, n****z rewindin
instead of movin forward, to blow up so what's the science?
people shoutin, police pushin the crowd
and on the ground's a young soldier, with meat hangin out him
am i hallucinatin off the hazin?
or did i just see a n**** shoot another n****'s face in
it's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
photograph pictures of, suspect faces
it's usually, two or three n****z who innocent
but if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
a divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair
i dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
this color purple'll make whoopi give me the p****
 oprah and danny glover gots to feel me
this is how i escape the madness, too much of anything'll hurt you"
"uhh,uhh, where am i going?
where am i? yo, it's ill
yo my wife's tired of f***ing me
life tries ducking me
luckily i find 'em just at the right time
mack in my right arm, tequila bottle in
my left arm like cristian
watching my life go, keeping myself in
wolves in the night yo, hells men
two revolvers i can let twelve spin
hop in my benz, push it to the limit
buck sixty, who wit' me? my  to well
twisted blunts and inner conscience
telling me that i aint shit
no matter how much cash i sit with
still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
my precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
to replenish my adolescent brain
blessed be her name, before her birth i was insane
so i drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain
i ate from these poisonous, f***ed up streets
tasted larceny, it was sweet, i starved for more to eat
though i took, that was to live, hope god will forgive
as odd as it is, the more i gain the harder it is
to maintain, b****es playin' games
n****s snitchin', i aint saying names
but y'all n****s better watch how y'all slang
lost so many close n****s, drunk almost crashed
i'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash
lights in my rearview, if they stop me i hope they lock me
instead they speed ahead
yo n**** watch me
chorus:
i'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
i don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
i'm a ride to the end of the road if i have to
praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
steering wheel in my hand
trying to hold it steady
anything in my way is dead
cause that's the way i feel, i am already
when i'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
drunk by myself
heard n****s hate me, but i hated too once
been in the shoes of a wolf in the night when he hunts
for every shell n****s bust, we bust at ourselves
can't tell them n****s nothing though, bullets wak'em up well
take them to hell
stick up n****s once ran up on me
my deckited lifestyle attracted sharks on me
i aint your mark homey
it's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
spilling my bottle not even shook of the jakes
could hardly look both ways, put out the hayes blurry vision
think about the time in my life before i was in televison
hella women, jealous n****s up in my vision
since we all hood n****s expect kilos
for what they not seeing is police expect rico
only if i could take care of everybody, intoxicated
windows up blastin a.c. going wherever instinct takes me
i hate it when i'm like this
the bottle's my accomplice
chorus: 1x
the reason that i want to be alone
tired of all the things that went wrong
that would have went right if i would have did it on my own
take another swigg
the more i drink, the more i think bad thoughts
fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
not knowing who to trust, runors about n****s coming through
supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
or what to believe, that's why i'm on the low lately
choosing a henny bottle over a friend, lost again
to keep my mind off that weak shit
there's love through it all, things to live for
i swerve, almost crash into a wall
think about the good, find myself laughing
turn the cell off, no way to be reached
know i'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets
reminded of the positive, i take my drunk ass home
start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
bring my ass to the crib
i'm tired..."
"""get get.. get down!""   
uh.. uh.. uh..
new york streets where killers'll walk like pistol pete

one day grabs me, as i'm about to blast heat
40 side of vernon, i turned well he asked me
""whatchu up to, the cops gon' bust you""
i was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled i wondered
if god sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
and looked at us, i ain't flinch when they watched
i took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
starin at a young disciple, i almost gave my life to what the dice do
yeah man, throwin them bones

pre trial hearin is over, it's real for the soldier
walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
triple homicide, i sit in the back aisle
i wanna crack a smile when i see him
throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
he grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin
then he grabbed the judge, screams out    nobody leavin everybody
""get down, get down! get down, get down!""    everybody
""get down, get down! get down, get down!""

new york gangstas, we loungin, out in l.a. see

i rolled with some crips down to a crenshaw funeral
never saw so many men slaughtered and i knew the ho responsible
the n**** still alive in a hospital
midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
see my cousin's in the game, thuggin and things

"chorus:
i know i can
be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it
ill be where i wanna be
i know i can be what i wanna be if i work hard at it ill be where i wanna be 
verse 1:
b b boys and girls listen up
you can be anything in the world in god we trust
an architect doctor maybe an actress
but nothing comes easy it takes much practice
like i met a woman whose becoming a star
she was very beautiful leaving people in awh
singing songs leana horne but the younger version
hung with the wrong person get a strung of that heroin
cocaine sniffing up drugs all in her nose
could of died so young now looks ugly and old
no fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
cause shes smells of corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if your going to be the best imma tell you how
put your hand in the air and take the vow
chorus:
i know i can be what i wanna be if i work hard at it ill be where i wanna be i know i can be what i wanna be if i work hard at it ill be where i wanna be 
verse 2:
b b boys and girls listen again
this is for grown lookin girls whose only ten
the ones who watch videos and do what they see
as cute as can be up in the club with fake id
careful fore you meet a man wit h.i.v

whatever you decide be careful some men be
rapist so act your age dont pretend to be
older than you are give yourself time to grow
ya thinking he can give you wealth but so
young boys you can use a lot of help you know

begging different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
if you believe you can achieve than say it like this
chorus:
i know i can be what i wanna be if i work hard at it ill be where i wanna be i know i can be what i wanna be if i work hard at it ill be where i wanna be 
verse 3:
b before we came to this country
we were kings and queens never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called cush
timbuktu were every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers who taught greeks and romans
asian, arabs and gave them gold when
gold was converted to money it all changed
money than became an powerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
africa was almost rob naked
slavery was money so the began making slave ships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was in shock that the mountains were black faces
shot up there nose to impose what basically
still goes on today you see
if the truth is told
the youth can grow
they'll learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangsters hoes
read more learn more change the globe
ghetto children do your thing
hold your head up little man your a king
young princess when you get your wedding ring
your man will sing ""shes my queen""
chorus:
i know i can be what i wanna be if i work hard at it ill be where i wanna be i know i can be what i wanna be if i work hard at it ill be where i wanna be

fatal not fictitious
i rock the cable 86 ??, foreign cars young with crazy b****es
mad smoke makes me able to quote
solicitin, ill editions of that murder i wrote
a provocative plan, can bring a knot to my hand
as the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
in the heat of the moment, like farrakhan said, we need atonement
bulletproof glass, s classes, chrome kitted up
cali ?? lit it up

and even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
while wishin' y'all were home
yeah, and can we have another moment of silence?

for soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
and families back home who pray they make it home safe
hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
this is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
mommy i'm still here, wishin' i was there with you

and can we please have a moment to mourn?
for pac, biggie and pun 'cause through us they live on
jam master jay, freaky ty and alliyah
big l and left eye, when we die we wish to see ya
can we please have a moment for children?
who got raped or murdered, or trapped in the system
who never knew their father, never learned to dream
but was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
for single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
bustin' her ass to give her kids shit she never had
for my n****z in the pen hopin' rhymes'll get 'em signed
so when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
for very mother that held a son in the street bleedin'
cryin' a song of sorow to dark and deep for speakin'
just a moment outside the day to day struggle
to let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born
same time my man is murderedm the beginning and end
as far as rap go, it's only natural, i explain
my plateau, and also, what defines my name
first it was nasty, but times have changed
ask me now, i'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
i spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine
saw my close friends shot, flatline am i sane?
that depends, carry mac 10's to practice my aim
on rooftops, tape cd covers to trees
line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
to the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
to the big dogs livin large, takin it light
pushin big toys, gettin nice, enjoyin your life
is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
and of course n   a   s are the letters that spell . .

from the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
dimes, givin fellatio, siete zeros
bet my nine spit for the pesos
but what's it all worth, can't take it when you under this earth
rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
they just rob your grave, i'd rather be alive and paid
before my number's called, history's made
some'll fall, but i rise, thug or die
makin choices, that determine my future under the sky
to rob steal or kill, i'm wondering why
it's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?

still coping and dealing with my environment as a kid
i trust no one today because what someone in my past did
king, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
king, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in

king, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
king, i started sayin' ""peace king"" on my song ""the flyest""
and after that, it took off like fire, peace, king
took it from a street dude, you don't need to be a street dude
get a lawyer, read your contract, and eat food
become roberta flack or lionel
when you catch flack, that mean they got they eye on you
produce great results, they start to lie on you
is it love for a queens dude in supreme shoes
or did the street code expire with these dudes?
especially now, i don't expect you to bow, but stand
creating jobs, named my venture from after the land
i came from, that's unheard of
a hood that's known for murder now doing mergers
the streets is a lie, don't believe these dudes, jail or death is all you get
they tell you never move, but when they get money, they split

they hardly happy for you, keep doing what you do
you can't please everybody, and not everybody is you
don't try to force a square peg in a round circle, that shit'll hurt you
don't try to fit in either, you're better off with neither
few veteran speakers get medicine when you need it
especially when we all need knowledge instead of sneakers
stop hangin' on to childhood trauma, it defeats us
our challenge is holding ourselves back, i hope you felt that

face to face  bitin' my case so we debate countin' all my sins , where do we begin
when i stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin
when i grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the mac 10
it was all retaliation,  from way back then

trusted and respected, almost got me arrested

child prone to violence like a dog returns to its own vomit
a fool for chaos, taking what we could salvage
hustling is a art, i'm just tryna be smart
strung out bodies found in the park, shaolin was my heart
we stood for loyalty, all we had was each other's back
my raps were like crystallized powder before crack
raw, uncut, like what is sold in front of the storefront
the sidewalk was my brother's office
we cut our losses, i had choices
i took a pen, became the voice for the voiceless
my people walking in a zombie state
life is short, even mine's at stake

you for me and me for you
we see things alike
we live alike, in truth
the craziest things already happened, get me
could tell you 'gon be laughing at me or you laughing with me?
my baby's mom made a book about me, she tried to out me
in barnes & nobles new release section she's confessin'
now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman
couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth
was she looking for fame? yo i hope she got it
since then i been the object, gossip people tried to target
all women should bid
for keeping real fathers away from their kids
these rappers talkin' real shit i lived
how many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin'
hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand
stevie wonder sent me word that he was in my corner
blind but still sees the pain of a young performer
used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us
she married again and i'm wishin' all the best to her
got me looking for my mother, all i see is suckers
she lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em
come on i'm livin', i don't need many to pray for me
her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad
tell you lames something, spit some game
planes carry me to madrid, spain, so why complain?
when you place blame, then you're defective
when you take blame, then you're respected
you gotta give me credit
woah
life is good, i must admit it
woah
ups and downs, we've all been through it
woah
ain't no other way to do it
woah
life is good, it's good, it's good
uh
the craziest things just happened to me, get me
so now whatever happens next it probably won't affect me
how many people owe the feds, keep it real especially
if you an artist in this music game, the smartest ones get abused for their change
and my life is sex, super stardom, and stupid cash
so unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast
i signed my own checks, swore we paid the irs
somebody's stealin', i swear to god
tsk, for now, i invest
to my incarcerated team who got life
it's not right but you still got your life
rest in peace to gil scott from the kill or be killed blocks
not from philly but a n**** done hustled them hilltops
commercial pop artists get all the accolades
i give a million cash away to be revered like donny hathaway
probably not as half as paid as i should be
but i stay in some cars and stay in some p****
it's a beautiful life
beautiful life, beautiful life
woah
life is good, i must admit it woah ups and downs, we've all been through it
woah ain't no other way to do it
woah life is good, it's good, it's good
a thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff
i can say i never been punked, robbed, or smacked up
proud to say i never been chased, jumped, or backed up
or extorted for my pay stubs
lucky or blessed from what prayer does
'cause hey, i was riding in caravans with ak's and gloves inside 'em
and if i should spare that man who violated my trust
i gave him a pass
my man called and i value his judgement
i let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over
so if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun
i'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder
'cause i chilled and let you breathe, yes
let's go our own ways and let the beef digress
i done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us
my younger brother knows this
not jungle, got another brother in pa
spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day
i gotta say i got some fam across the usa
cackalack to kansas but my mans around the way had contacts
they was spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye
willie, bo, blowing haze, mayo next door
joe, martin, slade, i'm solo these days
it wasn't my fault
i never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in new york
barely survived
large, i thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter p's in the booth
how to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth
i could nail it, you knew
i was your brother 'til death
back when you put me on to niquay from lefrak
you was a dime, we was nobodies
say what's up to shameek, send my love to yadi
i pray we all get old if i never again go gold and sell tickets
we could all still kick it
it's a beautiful life
beautiful life, beautiful life
rest in peace to my brother talik
gone too soon
god bless your soul brother
he was wild
some things we just can't explain
life
it's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back
with your kids at an early age
first steps, first words
i can't see 'em cause you mad
don't put yourself before the babies
don't say crazy things to hurt that man
you hurt him enough
the good times outweighed the bad
when it was good, it was great
but because i could see him now through the courts, you mad
okay that's how it is out here
that's life huh
you see we can't be selfish out here
we gotta live and let love
let the light in
to the beautiful mothers of my kids
and all the mothers around the world
night, destiny
life is good"
"fully grown with your hormones now
got your own home and you alone
wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
you a big girl now, in a world, where these n****s are foul
you coud be aborting the next michael jordan
your man don't wanna be around
she's sexy, she got it, she ride it
every n**** wanna be inside it
i need her, i'll eat her
do anything to please her
my ghetto queen of sheba
i'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
get you hype when i lick it, put it in your face
sipping red wine, is it bedtime
you can kick it with your n**** while we listen to faith
i'm feeling richer today
i can hit it then stay
lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
we got champagne, whipped cream, i'ma grab a bucket of ice
bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
it's your night, no stress, no fight
mad at your ex, cause his dough tight
never go right when you're with him
try you best to forget him
cause it's easy to please me
cd skip when your head board hit the wall
call for the law
right when you cum, i'm biting your tongue
make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
you can hit a blunt if you want
i'ma pull my pants up
we can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
tell me what's the reason for us
to love or to f***
i'm the thug that you want
if it's gangster we can't front
if you want me i can stay around
if you need me, i'm here for you
how that sound?
now it's up to you
depending on how you wanna get down
cause you're a big girl now
got your name and your number in my cell phone
hear your voice and i wonder where you are, if you all alone
if you in a good mood, if you not
or you thinking bout you was at my spot
what we did when we got hot
is you dreaming you had me?
is you creaming your panties?
like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
on the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
and we ate each other like candy
under the covers, two intimate lovers
you f*** a n**** like you mad at me
throw the ass to me
you should be glad to be
in the presence of a real thug as bad as me
while i'm in the streets with my murdering squad
you talking to your friends that i'm hurting it hard
how i'm making my rod, how i make you say ""oh god""
every hoe that you know wanna know nas
gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
cause you know how these girls are
wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
starting to get an erection
guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
i need time to breathe
wanna follow me, ironically
you pop up, throwing bottles at my tahoe
like it's my fault
but you don't wanna talk
don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
you and the shorty start scuffing
now shorty dumping you out
can't let her get the best of you
so i rescue you
only thing left to do was to grab her
so you can jab her, get a cheap shot
you don't wanna feel chumped
now here the cops come
so we gotta run to the ride
then we drive off through the traffic
don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
looking at your face
and the damage in your facial
every angle can't let it faze you
no reason to be insecure or immature
baby girl see the world is yours"
"a man reproduces himself through his child
so when he leave here, he can just smile
but i see fit to stay here a while
maybe buy a timeshare somewhere
rock bum wear, beach chair, write a book each year
you can write yourself out of your blessings
wreck your lambo the first day just by driving too reckless
time is too precious, these some obvious lessons
please remind me to watch my stеp while i balance on edgеs
ski on the slopes of life, slide down the ave at night
watching the graff and graffiti on walls, that's a sight
cars from germany, i be pushin' the fastest type
look into real estate, brother, i need the askin' price
imagine another rapper makin' me perspire
i got more styles and more flows, plus i'm much flyer
i got more heights to reach, but i'm already higher
i'm already onto the next thing, peace and bless king
peace and bless king
big nas, old money, new money, rap money
tec money, flex money, what's next? you funny
me, myself, i'm the illest alive
i can do a whole album on how it feel to survive
my daughter's a businesswoman, i'm so proud of her
my son, he's almost twelve and he's so knowledgeable
new music, new content, new programming, i ran the gamut
got my hands in everything like kids with bad manners
save the high school banter
at night school you studied my life lookin' for answers
i hear my callin', heart poundin' down my chest
wish i could bring back x, god bless
i don't practice, i don't remember my lines
i'm just here so i don't get fined
i'm athletic with poetics, these are alpha male alphabetics
never touched a rolling stone cover but i don't sweat it
imagine another rapper makin' me perspire
i got more styles and more flows, plus i'm much flyer
i got more heights to reach, but i'm already higher
i'm already onto the next thing, peace and bless king
peace and bless king"

 whassup girl..

talkin that old off the wall back to africa shit again
 what, that god body shit?
 yeah, that dumb shit
i'm tryin to get up outta here
 i hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumpin tonight
 word f'real where?
 you know, where the real n****z is poppin the cristal
not that white stuff!
 ha hah! word where the real n****z at?
listen.. to reason
pretty baby baby listen..
a young wild beautiful love child
you like them thug style link rockin, then mink coppin
hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin
the head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine
reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
you was innocent, but now you rent a d***, wear the tightest shit
chanel lookin real, airbrushed nails
hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven sent but negligent to see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me
the way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
wishin i could be the one man; but you juggle
way too many willies all in one hand
you wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on
n****z pull your hair, shake your fat rear
get your f*** on   followin week, you back there
but what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
puffin with some lil n****, husband not knowin she's out
could you believe eve, mother earth of the seas
n****z thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave
what up mah, frontin like you naive
pusherman's whip, callin police when you flip
can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
but for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!
chorus: jojo hailey
diamonds all shinin, lookin all fine
pretty little face, get a little high
young girl stugglin, tryin to survive
mother of the earth, she made you and i
just tired of playin the same ol' games
messin with my mind, emotional thangs
and there goes.. a black girl.. lost
like isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless
grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
to who'sever gettin down and trifless
to get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless
cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
more than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed there you go again, startin wars, makin me more yours
seem to get a kick out of keepin me on all fours
face glistenin, i'm addicted to you
original, wisdom body got me picturin you
igloos of ice trickin on you, you never listen
to this n**** spendin franklins on tennis anklets
must've had a bad deal in the past though
can't even keep it real with a n**** with cash flow
say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
you got a job part time and school's your night thing
with dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
you gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin screwed
typical day that the black girl sees
comin home wantin more from a college degree
chorus
where are you focused, on legit n****z and where the coke is
nice and thug life n****z, yo you seem hopeless
your value   too much to be measured, i wonder how you
could ever be played, your p**** worth gold amountin to
more than the world, but not knowin nothin about you
you leavin the crib, takin all your kids out to
drop them off, lettin some n**** knock you off
so hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost growin up seein it, it should remind you, you bein lied to
everything that move be inside you
sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
i watched you, hard to knock you, i tried not to
they spot you out dancin topless in your drawers
damn look, there goes a black girl lost
you should be ashamed of yourself
the way you carry yourself
the way you hang out all night long
doin silly things that is wrong"
"they forgot us on the block
got us in the box
solitary confinement
how violent are these cops?
they need an early retirement
how many rallies will i watch?
i ain't got it in me to march
i got a semi to spark
the game's in a drought
public housing, projects
cooking up in the pyrex
my set, my click
either getting money
or running from homicide trial
that's if they ain't died yet
trying to be rich
still i'm pledging allegiance
a predicate felon
a ghetto leader
lending my poetical genius
to whoever may need it
i bleed this from queensbridge
now living with my feet up
never defeated
so a president's needed
y'know these colored folks
and negroes
hate to see one
of their own succeeding
america, suprise us
and let a black man guide us
what's
the black pres thinkin'
on election night
is it how
can i protect my life?
protect my wife?
protect my rights?
every other president
was nottin' less than white
'cept thoman jefferson
and mixed indian blood
and calvin coolers
kkk is like 'what the f***'
loadin' they guns up
i'm loadin' mine too
ready to ride
cause i'm ridin'
with my crew
he dies
we die too
but on a positive side
i think obama provides
hope
and challenges minds
of all races and colours
to erase the hate
and try and love one another
so many political snakes
we in need of a break
i'm thinkin'
i can trust this brotha
but will he keep it way real?
every innocent n**** in jail
gets out on appeal
when he wins
will he really care still?
say a prayer
for ""do we have to?""
you ain't right

anything we need done
we gotta do for self
new improved jfk on the way
it ain't the 60's again
niqqas ain't hippies again
we ain't falling
for the same traps
standing on the balconies
where they shot the king at
mccain got apologies
ain't nobody hearing that
people need honesty"
"uhh
yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
all we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
and you believe when they be tellin you lie, all on the media?
they make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
why you listen when the teachers at school
know you a young single parent out strugglin, they think you a fool
give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
killin shorty future, i wonder how do we last it
underground in they casket? ancestors turnin
i'm learnin somethin every day, there is no lazareth
words like god is greek or latin
so if you study egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
my n****z is chillin, gettin high, relaxin
envisionin, ownin shit, yo it can happen
what do we own? not enough land, not enough homes
not enough banks, to give a brother a loan
what do we own? the skin on our backs, we run and we ask
for reperations, then they hit us with tax
and insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
so stop bein controlled, we black zombies
walkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin we just copy cat, followin the system walkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin we just copy cat, followin the system 
aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, f*** behind bars
we've already gone insane
they've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
stab our own backs and dream too much
without fulfillin reality; too greedy and
can't have one or two chains, we need three of dem
can't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em
on our own people and, f*** black leaders
cause whites ain't got none leadin them, the rhythm is cosmic
nas is divinity, the deity's prophetless
all get down and get up
victims walkin 'round with down's syndrome, all stuck
faintin, shoutin, catchin holy ghost in church
scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doin it first
we begged, we prayed, petitioned and demostrated
just to make another generation   black zombies
you scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance
feel free, hear the music and dance
if you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
dumb n****z with long beards like they arabs or jews
or from israel, bismi allah al rahman al raheem
islam's a beautiful thing
and christian and rastafari, helps us to bring
peace against the darkness, which is ungodly
so what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
use your own intuition, you are tommorrow
 .. that's the sound of the beast
i'm a columbia record slave, so get paid
control your own destiny, you are a genius
don't let it happen to you like it did to me, i was a black zombie
wake up! black zombies in a spell for more than fo' hundred years
ghetto n****z won't have it no mo', can i get a witness?
why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
when you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it"

yeh, this is how we got here
slave trade and the diamond trade
every childs afraid, when his mother or father gets sprayed

his mind can't take what he's going through
lookin' in the dirt for that ice ol' blue
then the royal family the ice goes to
this thing has to change, feelin' half ashamed
as i rap with my platinium chain
when you shop for a gift for me
you think about the misery
the same way we made a part our history
we could do the same to the complect ice
but everybody wanna shine right?
everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
they wanna shine on em 
uh
my bbs glimmers on my chest
two hundred thousand crested watch on my wrist
i wonder how people starve to death
when god blessed the land that lacks the harvest
their stones are quality, but their homes are poverty
and the whole world ignores the robbery
i bought my girl pretty rocks and she is mad at me
tear drop shaped uh, perfect clarity
it shocks so many are killed annually
cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity
stop talkin' and do something about it
every holiday season, jewelery stores crowded
kids snatched from their homes, mutilated alive
husbands spreaded from wives
keep a jesus peace to be fly

everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed

that see they names ring loud on some fbi poster
must be on ex or he coked up, suggesting i post a
bail, i'm like yes, 'cause we soldiers
we just getting older, in time, we still in our prime
i can't afford a new arrest on my folder

pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded
plenty henna in me, envy was simply they trend, see
my enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
the high life, the fly life
pierre hardy, imitation of christ
ice wear gaudy, since '94 flossy
the lex was an excellent choice, now fast forward me
the pestilence of the ghetto informed me
as a shorty, to push nothin' less than a 740
with fresh linens, sip pellegrinos with airs on
they sick, mixing they water with airborne
oh, they so sick!
look how i got 'em going crazy, look at that!
you gotta let it out, stress...ain't good man
you gotta breathe

"""the light is there.""
see i come from mississippi
i was young and runnin' wild
ended up in new york city, where i had my first child
i named the boy nasir, all the boys call him nas
i told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
let's go!... hey hey hey hey   
tribrary of these rap skits, styles i mastered
many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
but i'm still number one, everyday real
speak what i want, i don't care what y'all feel
'cause i'm my own master, my pop told me be your own boss
keep integrity at every cost, and his home was natchez mississippi
did it like miles and dizzy, now we gettin' busy
bridging the gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
the history of music on this track
born in the game, discovered my father's music
like prince searchin' through boxes of purple rain
but my minneapolis was the bridge, home of the superkids
some are well known, some doin' bids
i mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
if pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo
greatest man alive gre gre gre gre greatest man alive!
the blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
old school, new school, know school rules
all these years i been voicin' my blues
i'm a artist from the start, hip hop guided my heart
graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in spoffard, juvenile delinquent
but pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
books to read, like x and stuff
'cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
in art class i was a compulsive sketcher of
teachers in my homeroom, i drew pix to mess them up
'cause none'a them would like my style
read more books than the curriculum profile
said, ""mr. jones please come get your child
'cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""
greatest man – the great greatest man alive
hey hey hey    my poppa was not a rollin' stone
he been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
then he got grown, changed his name to olu
come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to
i been to saudi arabia, mozambique
madagascar, paris, greece
the middle africa is where we lived
better known as queenbridge
nas, nas you don't stop
olu dara in the house, you don't stop
muddy waters' howling wolf you don't stop
from the blues to street hop you don't stop
tell 'em pop
see i come from mississippi i was young and runnin' wild ended up in new york city where i had my first child i named the boy nasir all the boys call him nas i told him as a youngster
he'll be the greatest man alive greatest man alive gre gre gre gre greatest man alive!
rest in peace ray charles"
"i guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby
bye baby, i guess you knew why i walked away
when we walked to the altar that was an awesome day
did counseling couldn't force me to stay
something happens when you say i do, we go astray
why did we mess it up? we was friends, we had it all
reason you don't trust men, that was ya daddy fault
he in the grave let it go he no longer living
said you caught him cheating with mom, f***ing other women
f*** that gotta do with us?, here's the keys to the newest truck
birkin bags, we burnin' cash, now baby do it up
no matter who you f***, that was before me
wanted you as my shorty since before i saw you screamin'
""hate you so much right now""
should've saw the man in angry black women
actions of a demon   i'm leaving
i guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby you know i'm saying bye bye cause i'm sayin' bye bye 
bye baby, i guess you know why i had to leave
seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
you and your star trak fam, i'm thinking you cats are weird
same time different year, i was diggin' your flow
then i tatted you on my arm so n****s would know
i thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
i was your johnny depp, you was my janis joplin
yet, the cuter version, yet i knew you personally
better than you knew yourself and i knew this for certain
crib in the dominican you got away from everybody
you screaming at the racist cops in miami was probably
the highlight of my life, like ""hiyo look at my wife""
gangsta, me and twenty cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
bailed you out, next morning we got clean
like it never happened and later we at that heat game
just another day in the life of two people in love
but it wasn't enough, so baby guess what...
listen, could you imagine writing your deposition?
divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
""with you paying out the ass, and i'm talking half
not some but half. no serious, half""
half of your soul, half of your heart you leaving behind
it's either that or die, i wanted peace of mind
and all i seen was selfish cowards, under they breath
saying ""why did nas trust her?"",
but look at yourself, speak louder bro
you live with your babymoms and scared
to make an honest woman out of her
and make her your bride, fake b**** you ain't even alive
at least i can say i tried plus enjoyed the ride
plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
he got my nose, my grill, your colour, your eyes
next go round i hope i pick the truest type
and watch me do it all again
it's a beautiful life, aight
goodbye"

they called me ""babyface"" in eighty eight
on 40th and broadway they made me stay and wait
cab service, car eighty five
ten minutes, they back in the car
not safe to drive, narcos are lookin' no secret compartments in the ride, so keep pushin'
we get stopped, hide it between the seat cushion
either that, or just tuck it inside your boot
don't throw it out the window yet, son, that's all our loot see? they turned, they wasn't after us, my n**** with me laughin' he clutchin' his gold lazarus, made it home and he baggin' up i'm just a lil' n**** smokin' weed i'm just tryna figure out who to be horse and dula touchin' paper plus, spud and wallet head, a lot of bread
and i was talkin' to tia
i went to her block, i was just happy to see her
and low was how she did me she moved from queens to co op city she said, ""visit me, that's if you really miss me""  , show proof
ten n****s outside her buildin', that's what i go through 1989, my baby mind was advancin' nike air trainer 3's, two fingers on her hand, son i'm losin' her slowly plus my other girl is startin' to move on the homie
hop in eighty five, roll with me 
when i used to slide
i used to call car eighty five
don't want no other driver on the job only car eighty five
yo, take me uptown to that smoke shop i like car eighty five
all blacked out tint everywhere we went, we took car eighty five 
we gon' ride
put that tape on i like
you know that tape i like, turn that shit up we gon' smoke and ride go to times square, we take it from there
just ride it's friday
it woulda been a good night to pick up shorty, but she on some other shit 
in my peripheral view
nothin' trivial 'bout me, just witness the truth, i'm certified
that's been verified
my mere presence got other guys terrified slap oxygen out your esophagus i survived with stick up kids, was droppin' shit the rotten apple's the tabernacle
that's ny, white castles at midnight
fish sandwiches, forty ounces and fistfights they even used car eighty five to pull robberies
use 'em as a getaway car and paid him properly
next year the whole town strung out
swept the block where they hung out
look how far we've come now grab the duffel and run out
seven fiends in one house, hustle sun up to sundown
what up? summertime in ny
in the back seat of car eighty five 
the whole hood was tryna call car eighty five
any car like that, any number that had that system
or that cool ride you know that'd make your whole day
just bein' able to get up and go
to this day, i just like to ride
lot of thoughts come to mind "
"yea, n****z want to talk about this rap shit
n****z want to talk about this money
about these cars, these homes, these labels
clothes, sneakers, big money shit
now everybody tryin' to get rich
now get rich n****z, f*** it
some rap pioneers, be them crackheads
when they speak, you see missin' teeth
silver chain with a silver piece
n****z your grandfather's age
they pants still hangin' down they legs talkin' about they ain't paid
and they hate you, 'cause they say, you ain't pay dues
and ..... was stealin' and robbin' them
i feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
hip hop been dead, we the reason it died
wasn't sylvia's fault or because mc's skills are lost
it's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
deep rooted through slavery, self hatred
the jewish stick together, friends in high places
we on some low level shit
we don't want n****z to ever win
see, everybody got a label
everybody's a rapper but few flow fatal
it's f***ed up, it all started from two turntables
when they crown you   and you rise up to your position
when they knight you   then you go to fight, go to war, don't petition
   carry on, ca carry on, , when you rep what we rep
then 
now some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
wit their fingers intertwined in some gang sign madness
i got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
let's see who can quote a daddy kane line the fastest
some of you new rappers, i don't understand your code
you have your man shoot you, like in that sopranos episode
do anythin' to get in the game, mixtapes, you spit hate
against bosses; hungry f***s are moraless
you should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
n****z, i coulda wrote your shit; i had off time, was bored wit this
i coulda made my double lp, just by samplin' different parts of nautilus
still came five on the charts with zero audience
the lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
y'all got awards for your bricks   it got good to ya
you started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! what?
when they crown you   and you rise up to your position
when they knight you   then you go to fight, go to war, don't petition
   carry on, ca carry on, , when you rep what we rep
then 
now n****z got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
the live in the park sound, versus the studio state of art sound
we on the charts now; from british walkers and argyles
look at us rap stars now, wit our black cars now
fortune 500 listed, brunches, sip cipriani's
sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
thick white girls around me, chinese lined up
because i'm what?, every dime lust
we used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up
if i want that or the whole world to peep it
now f*** a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em
i promise i 
when they crown you   and you rise up to your position
when they knight you   then you go to fight, go to war, don't petition
   carry on, ca carry on, , when you rep what we rep
then "

one more time, one more time
uh, one more time, uh
one more time
i dream of the day i can go back to when i was born
laying in your arms, wishing you was here today mom
wish you'd appear
just for a second from heaven my tears would be gone
i wouldn't be rapping this song
i'd be happy driving up to your 8 bed room mansion
up late, laughing bout the hard time we faced
the galaxy is so enchantin beyond, galileo's understanding
past the milky way and all the planets
there's something out there greater
but only god knows, scientist claim we came from apes
but they lies though, that was part of our conversation
i spark went up a star blazing
thinking of how amazing she was
a angel gave me love
i'm thankful, to ever know a women so real
i pray when i marry my wife i have one of your skillz
but mom you could never be replaced
i'd give my life up
just to see you one more day
to have...
one more dance with you mama
if i could only have
one more dance with you mama
praying, wishin i could have
one more dance with you mama
if i could only have
one more dance with you mama
i wish you were here,
i miss you more each second i breathe
you resting in peace forever i accepted you free
a blessing to me, i see you dressed in all white
smiling at me, happy knowing everything's all right
if only i can hear your voice and your laughter
just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
april 7, o 2
that's when the gates of heaven opened up for you to stroll threw
beautiful anne jones
job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood

for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters
i saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
who locked up, first i regretted it
then caught my rage, like
how could i not protect her from this awful phase?
never tried to hide who i was, she was taught and raised like
a princess, but while i'm on stage
i can't leave her defenseless
plus she's seen me switching women,
pops was on some pimp shit
she heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
so if her husband is a gangster
can't be mad, i'll love him
never, for her i want better, homie in jail   dead that
wait till he come home, you can see where his head's at
got game, they be tryna live
he seen your mama crib, plus
i'm sure he know who your father is
although you real, plus a honest kid
don't think i'm slow, i know you probably had that chronic lit
you 17, i got a problem with it
she looked at me like i'm not the cleanest father figure
but she rocking with it

for my brothers with daughters, i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important
for my brothers with daughters, i call this

this morning i got a call, nearly split my wig
this social network said ""nas go and get ya kid""
she's on twitter, i know she ain't gon post no pic
of herself underdressed, no inappropriate shit, right
her mother cried when she answered
said she don't know what got inside this child's mind,
she planted a box of condoms on her dresser
then she instagrammed it
at this point i realized i ain't the strictest parent
i'm too loose, i'm too cool with her
shoulda drove on time to school with her
i thought i dropped enough jewels on her
took her from private school, so she can get a balance
to public school, they too nurture teen talents
they grow fast, one day she's ya little princess
next day she talking boy business, what is this
they say the coolest playas
and foulest heart breakers in the world
god gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important
for my brothers with daughters, i call this
for my brothers with daughters, i call it
not sayin' that our sons are less important
and i ain't tryna mess ya thing up
but i just wanna see you dream up
i finally understand
it ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
nah, the way mothers feel for they sons,
how fathers feel for they daughters
when he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
when she date, we wait behind the door with the sawed off
cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters

when my crew told me it was you that was player hating
then we had to have that terrible confrontation
there's nothing i can do to help this situation...

we was tryna squash the whole shit in vegas
no media to eat it up and leak it in the papers
eric b, big d, and 'preme was affiliated
peace to edi, napoleon, and all the innovators
we had respect before we was ever some entertainers
see suge, he was a dangerous threat
mob almost turned half of new york red
brothers i grew up with threw up, they sets
some even had them death row chains hang off their necks
there's a rumor that spread i'd like to address
pac was never set up by stretch i stepped to him at bryant park, so we could speak direct
he didn't disrespect, we planned to reconnect
i flew to vegas to shoot the street dreams
video and link with 2pac

we didn't talk, but he was still alive in the hospital
and it rained that day in vegas
rest in power
chill out, chill out, yo

happy days balancing with life's atrocities
hoppin' in v's, knowin' some day i got to lead properly

pretentious, arrogant n****s is senseless
pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives
while you could catch me in a crisp white five
dark tinted, dijon scented, with al green on
my theme song, love and happiness, how can it seem wrong
i mean before this, i used to rock a taurus with the donuts
now i grown up, got it chromed up
got the rap game sewn up, sho nuff

said evil b****es and jealous men would try to destroy me

i'm on top now, slightest drama, i'll have ta kill ya
cuz animals and sweetness, sharks smell blood in water

for every n**** toned in the pain and heavy metal
for every child that's born
and every n**** gone
and for every brotha breathin'

got knocked refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
basically i'm just reality loaded with vast stories
of lust, greed, and contempt no street is exempt
extended clip shots hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
i sip shots, watchin' em hustlers pitch rocks
all you paintin' pictures of my pain
illustrate the city in vain
fallin' deep into the pits of the game
this is for the sickest state of mind
in these fatal times, vesh crimes
nickel play the nine and n****s for the dime
hear the sounds of them baby's cry
still i'm sayin' why do we reside
in the ghetto with a million ways to die
stayin' high to relieve the pain
breathin' in the game, exhalin'
guilts and the shame, misery and strain
what the f*** will tomorrow bring
look at anthrax, i stand back through
hopin' i make it tomorrow
my skin is a art gallery, right
with paintings of crucifixes
hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
but since i tasted paper it started losin the friendships
watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
how could i tease them with benz's and feel no remorse
drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
f*** did i expect with bucket seats in a lex
and spendin' time in chuckie cheese with little des
got guns when i'm with my daughter
hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
she knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
black princess it's a ugly world
i put my life up for yours, see i love that girl
could you believe even my shadow's jealous
my skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
my brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
though my songs come from the father
i'm lonely...

chorus"
"yeah
i want all my n****s to come journey with me
my name is nas, and the year is 1973
beginning of me, therefore i could see
through my belly button window who i am...
i existed in a womb, just like an abyss
came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
twitching cause i'm nervous
thought my intended purpose
was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
but to take on a name, my pops chose for me
bloodstream full of indo
developing eyes looking out my belly button window
my father's face wears a frown
and i'm wondering if they even want me around
cause i'll go back to spirit town
so i could rest longer before i come back down
the chute again, in the near future when
my moms and pops can agree on this
was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
he dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont
you got a 120 days do what you want
but as for me coming back this be my last time
abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind
i shot my way out my mom dukes
i shot my way out my mom dukes
they must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and i'm still alive
guess i got what you call an ill will to survive
when i look hard the lights is killing my eyes
i know when moms is laying down cause i get bored and start to get live
move side to side hear loud music and vibe
all black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
i'm covered in this thick layer of goo
month two was the least most comfortable
my umbilical cord choking me
but month 3 was closer, see
thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
but i was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
while they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
i wondered if i am born will i be safe at all
this place they call the world though my view was so large
couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
month 5, month 6 went by, hoping i'm born in july
but the lord already figured out a date and time
septemeber 14th, 73
get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
arms open cause they know when i drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
see how the goverment will start re training cops
month 9, i'm a week over due, the labor induced
pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
said stay calm, holding her arm, i'm trying to hold on
surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
everything blurry, my first breath screams out
tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
wanted to hold me, but i was so bloody
they washed me off and he said ""at least that n**** aint ugly!""
placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
finally, i got to see who held me in her body
she loved me,and i plan to over through the devil
y'all bout to see this world in trouble"
"crime, life, b****es, money
time..
for my braveheart's.. my braveheart's
uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?
one time.. two times..
from ""breaking atoms"" to ""illmatic"", to goin platinum
shit did change course since rippin it with main source
nine one, nine two, time flew
out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule
younger frame, older state of mind
find my name on a page in your qu'ran, i learned that, in '89
when i was slingin cocaine and baby 9's
put it in rap and i gave y'all a way to rhyme
god guides us, from public assistance to high rises
condos, houses where y'all can't find us
move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up
my meal everyday was a slice and 7 up
took advice from a street legend
identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
witnessin n****z mistakes, visits at n****z wakes
cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate
look way deep inside yourself
discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
n****z never wanna see you with it, f*** them tho'
n****z can't come close enough to touch the dough
the lifestyle i live is untouchable
so we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
cause we learned to do what the hustlers do
different ways to come out the hood   in cuffs or a casket
or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets
or maybe   it's the rap shit, all type of tactics
we use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors
i asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend
less than ten years ago for me to get dough
what y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow
cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot
duckin truancy cops, trains i hopped, to make it downtown
cisco in my veins, pissed between trains
canal street, just lookin at rings
outside through a glass, went in the store and asked
how much it cost, korean man brushin me off
for some other big time customer, probably a hustler
who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
i said, ""i'll be just like you soon, motherf***er what?""
to them n****z who get life and throw a smile at the judge
wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood
keepin b****es, comin through on visits
you will survive, them weak freaks think you finished
you first time in you known for poppin your toast
by your third year in you forgotten by most
n****z wife cut them out of they life, n****z don't write
friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites
it be ill, n****z comin home and no time to get killed
not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards
in they own backyard or in the park
one to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart
in the projects, who gon' die next?
hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow
like the n****z know the rats, with some good asshole
blunts be a good ass roll while passin your 'dro
feel me?
one time, huh, two times, uhh uhh uhh"
"nas   gangsta tears
 only a few can feel my pain
 only if i could show you
 only if you was in this game
 you'd feel the whirlwind blow you
my daily dose is ferocious
i smoke dope, just as strong as opium
hopin i'm close to just breakin frustration;
speakin on podiums
facin this cold world head on, dead on arrivals
young black, poor education guns crack
the gang violence done that
nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches
dealers, b****es, killers and blunt smoke, clubs open
benzes, jeeps, dubs pokin out tires
thugs with heat, pay security, to let them slide in
huh, i'm at the corner driftin, sippin, cognac
to' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret
though i'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness
smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten
i'm soul searchin, i'm soul hurtin
what happens when money don't make you happy
i wish this on no person
ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements
i got no friends i'm lonely, don't want no pity save it
yo, ride in the nighttime, i'm high, got on my flight suit
hood with the night sign, dark colors on
pull up the block my brother's on
i hug him and we blow trees  scopin for police
guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks we left the drug game alone
brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home
what could you tell us?
at funerals my eyes swell up look at my dog lay in the casket
twin shotgun barrels had blasted
and rest in peace for him, is all i could whisper
as i paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin
it's part of god's plan, but why so many n****z have to die?
it's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by
bandana covers my eye, i'm scopin through the room
i see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons
and yet i feel responsible when my n****'s pronounced dead
inside the hospital, i wish there's somethin i could do, but.."
"say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigolo
it was difficult for me to find a chick i want
this ain't no sucka for love shit
this ain't no huxtable kisses and hug shit, first night we f*** shit
and don't call the next day, this a thug's wedding day
in love? will we make it? let us pray...
in a limo, my n****s, my father, my brothers
everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
hard bottasmov costumes, this ain't no act, though
factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
yes, i'm absolutely sure
i know that she love me, i know that she faithful
we spoke on a prenuptial agreement cuz will and jada ain't need it
spoke on eloping but then i deaded the thought
cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit
but know this, you f***in' wit a slit ya throat quick
vehicular explosions, cigar smokin'
dark minded, chart climbin, well spoken
safer world of broke men to rich ones
throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it, hun
headed to the chapel, my n****s laughin
and it's bafflin cuz just a year ago
it's weird, though, i knew i'd get married
to who? i knew not, thought of snatchin halle up from the dreadlock
pumpin' sade, my head knot
finally, i met the perfect b****, pardon my french, rephrase that
someone who made my heart stop, couldn't wait to blaze that
tired of hoppin' from honey to honey
hiv spreadin', everybody bump the same bunnies
the game'll put n****s in they graves right before they part ways with the street
i want a son to greet every mornin'
daughters and more sons tickle my feet
wife smilin', tellin' me it's time to eat
i'm gettin' married
it was my dream for my queen to put the ring on the ride
even martin luther king had a fling on the side
that's what the negative ones say
knew my wedding would be one day but quickly is this day
i know the hoes gonna miss me
lookin' at old photos, sayin, ""damn, he used to twist me""
start chokin' up since i woke up
bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
father saw me in a daze, knudged me with his left arm
told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm'
said she would love me oswald boateng
customized in london by guys who suit up kings
gov', you got the ring, jung', you behave
maxwell, he gon' sing, invited lauryn hill and the gang
baltimore, north cacky', mississippi
family packed in, my n****, l is crazy tipsy
spilled pepsi on the cufflinks, ginger ale got it out
walked in the church, just all big to thug it out
my girl walked in glistenin', different stones
'bout to go from my fiance to mrs. jones
that's a union that nobody can touch
i gotta be cool wit' ya crazy aunts and uncles
cuz i love you much...cuz you put up wit my shit
court cases, baby mommas
i make a honest woman outta you yet
everybody starin' at you, i'm at the alter, standin'
heart poundin' out my chest like a cannon
i'm happy, one of my groom's men
under the music says, ""don't do it""
but they just joke, some crew shit
they playin, i'm gleeful, i'm stayin'
i'm stayin' vows that are all true
""will you take music as your wedded wife?""
""i do.""

as the night close down on the earth like gray dark rings
light of cities in the nights, destination for kings
with big dreams, like castro, overthrew bautista
from cuba, and pointed nukes toward the u.s.
about to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
a lot of rules, some locked in solitude
curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?

i'm like the farmer, plantin words, people are seeds
my truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
may the children come in all colors, change like leaves
but hold before you, one of those, prophetic mc's
with blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
each channelin, from past to present times, heaven shines
light on those, innocent to how the world grows
some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
and you accounted for, everything that you heard
do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
my heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies

rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
dreams turned real   what's a wicked nation?
one with blind men   not takin charge of the situation
empty arguments and real conversations needed
the world'll need it, to hear it
evil tries to weaken my spirit   it's chronic herb
this hurt come from the honest word
i now try hardest to serve my maker, what i learned
find it's way on the paper, so i could dictate it
articulate it, luckily   i was put on one of the ships that made it
through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
to sink in the atlantic
satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but

if christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh lord

small visions of better life if cheddar was right
lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
trapped in the slums, beggin for nuttin but takin
headed for nuttin but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin
judges is not relatin to pleas, guns bustin where the kids play
richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
in bystanders, get cancelled, d.o.a.
around the way where we from
hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
life is every man's kingdom, a dyin man's past
and a newborn's, first time to be here at last
and shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
hustlin harder than the generations here before he came
goin through the same bullshit as our fathers
readin history, but who's the authors?
for some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
but never lose faith; through the years just get smarter

wit missin' front teeth twist blunts deep in the cut

and i love life, every minute is pure healin'

my man just came home speedin
tryin' to catch up wit 9 years of no freedom
the paper say   ""they finally caught 'em""
he back in, i guess street life got too borin'
kind of quiet, half the hood is still sleep
if you saw the night before you won't believe it's the same street
put on my lenses, leave the phantom
take the low whip for a trip up to pam pams
scramblin' white turkey cacon
""ma pass the hot sauce from out your apron"""
"i ain't goin back to jail

my friends stay powdered up, i'm so drunk, can't stand
you said if i would sober up, i'd be a powerful man
turned out the street life, you prayed i wouldn't

i stayed out late, you heard shots, thought it would be
your older son on the ground dead, but fortunately
the bullets had some other names on it, the brother was blind
i hit the el, than we yell out, ""it wasn't my time!""
i loaded up shells, one by one, you smelled blunts from my room door
little nasir was at war
and little did i care what you saw

preaching man, woman, and child, the living prophet

the ice king, god, the black christ, elegant stance
clothes fit me like a crime boss, the menacing man

young girls are fast and in their sasoon jeans, no prophylactic
all this fast shit and fly jewelry, now makes my eyes teary

rip the freeway, shoot through memphis with money bags
stop in philly, order cheese steaks and eat beans fast
and bring it back up top, remove the fake king of new york
you show off, i count off when you sample my voice
i rule you, before, you used to rap like the fu shnickens
nas designed your blueprint, who you kidding?
is he h to the izzo, m to the izzo?
for shizzle you phony, the rapping version of sisqo
and that's for certain, you clone me, your wack clothes line
i'd rather sean john, bore me with your fake ass rhymes
and those times, they never took place, you liar
un was your first court case, you had no priors
you master fabricated stories of streets and sound slick
have you surrounded, you and the b**** you down with
while they riding nas, trying to boost their careers
corny as cormega, all you hip hop queers
since illmatic, it was written: i am...nastradamus
that's the answers to the puzzle i gave you, now here's a promise
my next few albums, instead of projects,
they'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics
come in my hood, but bring the guns with you, it's dark
headed through brooklyn, queens, harlem, staten, and bronx
headed through compton, oaktown, south central, and watts
new orleans, mississippi, chi town, every block

"right...
check me out y'all, nasty nas in your area
about to cause mass hysteria
before a blunt, i take out my fronts
then i start to front, matter of fact, i be on a manhunt
you couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
that's like mlcom x catching the jungle fever
king poetic, too much flava, im major
atlanta and braver, i pull a number like a pager
cuz i'm am ace when i face the bass
40 side is the place that is giving me grace
now wait, another dose and you might be dead
and i'm a nike head, iwear chains that excite the feds
and aint' a damn thing gonna change
?'m a perform a strange show the mic wonder was born the game?
nas, why did you do it
you know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime
right...
it's halftime...
it's like that, you know it's like that
i got at him, now you never get the mic back
when i attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
so i react never calmly on a hype track
i set it off wit my own rhyme
cuz i'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
i'm max like cassettes, i flex like sex
in your stereo sets, nas will catch wreck
i used to hustle, now all i do is relax and strive
when i was young, i was a fan of the jackson 5
i drop jewels, wear jewels to never run it
wit more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
nasty nas has to rise, kid, surprise
this is exercise til the microphone dies
back in '83, i was an mc sparking
but i was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and
kick my little raps cuz i thought n****z wouldn't understand
and now in every jam i'm the phucking man
i rap in front of more n****z than in the slave ships
i used to watch c.h.i.p.s, now i load glock clips
i got to have it, i miss mr magic
versatile, my style switches like a f*****
but not a bisexual, i'm an intellectual
of rap, i'm a professional and that's no question, yo
these are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand
cuz in the streets, i'm well known like the number man
in my place wit the bass and format
explore rap and tell me nas ain't all that
and next time i rhyme, i be fould whenever i freestyle
i see trial n****z say i'm wow
i hate a rhymebiter's rhyme
stay tuned, nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime
right...
it's halftime
i got it going on, even flip 'em on this song
every afternoon, i kick half the tune
and in the darkness, i'm heartless like when the narcs hit
word to marcus garvey or heartless sparkton
cuz when i blast the herb, that's my word
i be slaying them fast, doing this, that in the third
but chill, past the entree and let's lay
i bag b****es up at john jay and hit a mantinee
putting hits on 5 0
cuz when it's my time to go, i wait for god wit the fo fo
and biters can't come near
and yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot garcia
i won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth i can't feed
that's extra phillie change, more cash for that weed
this goes out to manhatten, the island of staten
brooklyn, queens is living fat and
the boogie down, enuff props, enuff clout
illwill, rest in peace, yo, i'm out
right..."

hey y'all can't see a n**** like me, never in your life
and that's what you can't understand
chorus "
"would i pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
or save it all for you?
would i, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a flash
before reconsidering, this hell with you
it ain't you it's the things you do it's tearing my heart in two
i would of fell with you
to hell with you
if heaven was a mile away
and you could ride by the gates
would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?
would you pray louder finally believing his power?
even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?
how would you start acting?
would you try to put the ki's down?
thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets he can see now
would a fiend even want to get high, would he stop smoking?
if he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
to get away and escape from the craziness
and i bet you there's a heaven for an atheist
it's hard taking this
racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff
even if he innocent n**** get on the car put your motherf***ing hands up
thinking i'm a lose it
my mom's in chemo
three times a week, yo keep trying but people
is hard and god your young soldier's not so bold
but needs you
this world's my home but world i would leave
n**** what you think i'ma stop building
i'ma stop feeling like i'm amistad's great great grandchildren
how i'm not gonna want to make millions
since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke
pass with the reeses pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
but then my style has quite a while that same type as ill and al skratch
game time to them cats never looked back cristal blowing dub sacks
that's when it all just hit me
you see the broads and bentleys is nothing less my n**** spend it all with me
i'd give it all away quickly
just to hear them all i'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so
not to be recognized forgive me
it's becoming unbearable
making hits is easy
put a famous b**** on the hook there you go with a platinum cd
i know you heard the noise
preachers touching on altar boys
sodomizing not realizing god is watching before the lord
how can they do the devil's work?
a man giving another man head in church
hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that i fled the earth."

"damn! look how muh f***ers use a n****

it's like i'm a motherf***in gun
i can't believe this shit....
word up.. 
i seen some cold nights and bloody days
they grab and me bullets spray
they use me wrong so i sing this song 'til this day
my body is cold steel for real
i was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
under car seats they sneak me in clubs
been in the hands of mad thugs
they feed me when they load me with mad slugs
seventeen precisely, one in my head
they call me desert eagle, semi auto with lead
i'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
ohio to little rock to canarsie, livin harshly
beat up and battered, they pull me out
i watch as n****z scattered, makin me kill
but what i feel it never mattered
when i'm empty i'm quiet, findin myself fiendin to be fired
a broken safety, n****z place me in shelves
under beds, so i beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
keep me full up with hollow heads
chorus: nas 
how you like me now? i go blaow
it's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul
i might have took your first child
scarred your life, crippled your style
i gave you power
i made you buck wild
always i'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip
the barrel is my d***, uncircumcised
pull my skin back and cock me, i bust off when they unlock me
results of what happens to n****z shock me
i see n****z bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears
fall down the eyes of these so called tough guys, for years
i've been used in robberies, givin n****z heart to follow me
placin peoples in graves, funerals made cause i was sprayed
i was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
met a wrecked up tech with numbers on his chest that say
five two oh nine three eight five and zero
had a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place
where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
tired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun
but yo i had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
i make myself jam right in my owner's hand
chorus
yo, weeks went by and i'm surprised
still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
there's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin
cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear
he's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career
yo, i can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf
his eyes bubblin, he said, ""it was on""
i felt his palm troubled him shakin
somebody stomped him out, his dome was achin
he placed me on his waist, the moment i've been waitin
my creation was for blacks to kill blacks
it's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin n****z memories
but this time, it's done intentionally
he walked me outside, saw this cat
cocked me back, said, ""remember me?""
he pulled the trigger but i held on, it felt wrong
knowing n****z is waiting in hell for 'im
he squeezed harder, i didn't budge, sick of the blood
sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge
what the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
a newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
my owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast
i didn't know he was hit, it's over with
heard mad n****z screamin, n****z runnin, cops is comin
now i'm happy, until i felt somebody else grab me"

eyes meet people, strangers
not thinkin' of danger
amongst my people
some i see through
but one guy stares
maybe he thinks he knows me
or maybe he's crazy
killer, baller, dealer
something he has he wants to show me
but i'm at this red light
is it me or is he looking dead right
in my face?
as i pull the strap that i keep
underneath the seat
just in time
i was able to fled the scene
and leave him standing there
with his hands in the air
see, my life is green
harlem to queens
triborough bridge packed with cars
trucks, vans and cabs
they got this new ez pass thing
computer, taking over the cash thing
so as i drive home
i roll my window up
and my endo up in the same motion
see life is so full of surprises
and as i paid my toll
i drove to see my man
""what up kid, dunn, brova?
whats the deal?""
he said
""everything's easy bro'er man
it's all real""
i said
""but what happened earlier
why everybody outside?""
he said like
""blue suits came runnin' through
and took thirty brothas for a ride
yo, right after you left the ave""
yo, the same thing that's been going on
since i was young in the past
still goes on, how long will it last?
gotta get strong fast
out in the jungle
jungle
that's how it is
olu, got the music playing
outside it ain't no playing
we just paying attention
listening now to everything that's happening
cause if it's on it's on
and it's always on
it's just like this song ""jungle""
what's gonna happen next out here
it's gettin' crazier, weirder
people losing spirituality, morality
what's happening
from jazz b bop to rappin'
it's all the same thing, a black thing
a map thing, a world thing
boy, girl thing
woman, man, child
from sweden to the nile
to australia, europe
africa to venezuela
china, japan
everywhere you go understand
it's a jungle
the whole world
jungle
jungle
jungle!!

"to the kids in the p.j.'s
ghetto children i know it ain't easy

sunshine turns to rain

when a one time raise
sometimes the young is slain
to the kids in the p.j.'s black babies
brought up in this world where it's wild and crazy child of the nile
future lifestyle looks hazey
dreams to drive a mercedes
with a pile of ladies
third grade singing star spangled banner
using proper manners
learnt to handle anger animal behavior
later on my block rocking with my jocks on
eating bon ton chesse popcorn
humming a kiss rock song
socks long to my knees
summer breeze running through the leaves playing freeze tag
can i stay out please dad
can i hang out with my little gang out
hearing shots rang out
heard my moms call my name out
come upstairs run up stairs
take a bath shit stained underwear
wipe yourself with paper bad
little ass in my bed at 8:30 wash my plate
ate dinner up late
gazing at the wall praying basketball
was my future for this young one
hooping in the sun
proud to be where i come from
later shooting guns fantasizing
fascinated by gold rope chains
looking back at my hood days
but things aint changed
in my hood n****z smoke wood
nothing is good
look at my eys and see what i could
living my life and feel what i felt
the hand that i was dealt
drama that my uncle shabazz had
i was a little lad
n****z shooting through my grams window shattering glass
had the chicken pox
on that toy horse that rocks
my moms grabbed me down to safety
everybody in the crib was going crazy
that was in the 80's
and now im 17
money cash dreams
n****z be slave

little nayshawn owner of the crack house

tired of 'friderators all the steaks gone
now picture this shit

since ten was taught to turn 'em around
rip they pockets out
bust two the way they run
i ain't give a f*** that's how i was
i was young
horse was born as a brave child
big for my size
a bully to little guys
with chocolate miks and apple pies
the playground was mine
i stayed scarred up all the time
from shopping carts flipping
now we race to the finish line
hated playing cooties 'cuz that shit
wasn't fun all the honey's say i'm it
then they little ass run
i was sweared to put a hickey on the ones
that i caught
i was a nasty little n**** i learned to hump before i walk
kept a sling shot on my side to shoot
squirrles and cats
wanted to be captain america with the
shillinger hat i started getting older fell
more in love with the streets
infactuated by the ropes and the shiny
gold teeth i was to big to break dance
f*** spiining on my back
my role models now run numbers and sell
crack this project child blessed
chasing ghetto success
he needs a name for himself
to ge the same respect"
"yeah
hello, ladies and gentlemen
hit boy
i made the fade famous, the chain famous
qb on my chest match the stainless
amazing grace, i'm gracefully aging
without masonry, i made more paper to play with
no rap in my playlist, sold dimes on my day shift so, can i breathe? can i walk? can i speak? can i talk?
can i floss without you wanting me outlined in chalk?
family gossiping, pocket watching him
jealousy keeps blossoming, ain't let it box me in 'cause you are not a king if you can't come out a thing
that you got yourself in, claiming nobody helping
the stupidest part of africa produced blacks that started algebra
proof, facts, imagine if you knew that as a child, bruh
nostalgia, how i remembеr things
remember crowns, remember, kings
they want your reign to cease you a king, you will be next to me, doing your own king shit, most definitely
we're so ""say less when i speak"", y'all estrogen speak
respected by kings only, address me as chief
invested in things only a vet would
only lames front on kings, that's expected from creeps
you mad at my n****s and any woman with any interest in me
you could've made it  , look at all the time wasted
now you gotta retract statements, shoulda stuck to the basics
all you had to do was tell the truth, like, f*** all the fake shit
you should want every brother to make it out
but brothers want trophies, they troll for clout
rap is weird, weird flex, but okay
you ain't as ill as you think, you just okay
you got pressed in the hood, fix your jibs up, i'm on top
stop fighting it, yo, stop with the over righteousness
it's so lame, this media circus greedy and worthless
my life got 'em tight, why they wanna see me hurt up? real kings everywhere, stand up
it come with the game "
"uh, uh, uh, uh
lord have mercy, jesus christ
he's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
look at the life that i been through
i'm the last real n**** alive, that's official
y'all don't know about my biggie wars
who you thought 'kick in the door' was for?
but that's my heart, y'all still trippin of this jigga shit
real n****s listen up and i'mma tell you how the whole thing start
off top i brung queens up from hard times
rockin at the fever, streets was all mine
it was my version of the blues, droppin our schools
the crack epidemic had rap representin new rules
so i, got in em shoes, tried em wore them
wasn't a perfect fit, so i couldn't sport em
young murderers ride, i knew all them
jungle got shot, will died, we was warring
i wrote it in my album
i was 18 when lake seen the island
and lord held me down and
my surroundings started changing
i had a baby, i was making my rounds with az
n****s started noticing my flow and was open when
the golden child closed em in with more style than them older men
puff tried to start a label, prince rakeem had formed wu tang
snoop and dre had a new thang
so puff drove his new range through queensbridge projects
he let me drive it, before ready to die hit
big and i hit blunts performing at the arc
next thing you knew, big blew and all the balling starts
he had kim and his crew, i found fox, only n****s in new york with number
one charts
big was ahead of his time, him and raekwon my n****s
but dig it, they couldn't get along
that's when ghostface said it on the purple tape
bad boy biting nas album cover waybig told me rae was stealing my slang
and rae told me out in shaolin big would do the same thing
but i borrowed from both them n****s
jigga started to flow like us, but hit with 'ain't no n****s'
had much versace swagger
big admired the brooklyn knight and it took him in as iceberg the rapper
today don't know nothing, about this bullshit
there's more shit than wanting to be this king of new york shit
rap became a version of malcom and martin
rest in peace will, queensbridge live on
there's some ghetto secrets i can't rhyme in this song
there's some missing pieces i had to leave out
i had lot trust for steve stoute
at some point till i got to know him
we old friends, but what's loyal?
puff soaked interscope offices
with champagne bottles on steve, and steve thought the drama is on me
cause previously it would have been, against whoever
friends forever
however, i learn, with some n****s it's all business
but i'm a street dude with morals
to diss n****s with jigga too much, he used to say jay wanted my spot
i laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
a quiet man who used to be alone planning
baby moms thought i was too quiet, couldn't stand it
she hit the streets, later on she hittin the sheets
with a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinking he strong
i taught her how to watch for cars that might follow
tauht her street shit that i know
her weakness was shine yo
but that's her, i ain't mad baby, it made me stronger
now i get my paper longer
illmatic i was boss
it was written i flossed
one of the most creative lps ever to hit stores
in the firm i learned i am nastradamus
qb's finest, oochie wally, faced more problems
i gave it all up so i can chill at home with mama
she was getting old and sick so i stayed beside her
we had the best times, she asked would i make more songs
i told her not till i see her health get more strong
in the middle of that, jay tried to sneak attack
assasinate my character, degrade my hood
cause in order for him to be the don, nas had to go
the gam b i n o rules i understood
what you want, see, i already had
the gift and the curse? f*** that shit, the first shall be last
i'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
g o d s o n, they'll be none after
i was scarface, jay was manolo
it hurt me when i had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo (for dolo
echoes)

closets, full of rockets and submachines
take this n**** out the projects, and his thug team
yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
mr. child both coasts with the most loud toast
calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dyin
cause it's hard to f*** around when we dealin with science
my enemies got money, so y'all should watch how i play it
they never know we enemies until they hear me say it
til they kid's on the phone sayin, ""please daddy pay it""
til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
high class elegance, you respect or you hiss
you go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
it's strategic, how these n****z want you to think
you'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
why you stink? yo these streets don't allow you to blink
you get showered by lead, comin out with your mink
bow ties and tuxedos, bust eagles
dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the rico
it's hard f***in with n****z you hope you can trust
you a fool if your main b**** is easy to f***
and you've got money   is these hoes greedy or what?
shit is devious, ex friends wantin you stuck
chorus
uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
he wanna stick you
what's love, you got beef?
nobody rollin wit you
what's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
is love a four letter word, that deceives the air?
what's real, when you know your man's girl is a hoe
and you don't even let him know, cause you f***ed her befo'
what's real, when you talk behind a man's back
then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
what's trust, when they seperate your case
when you at your court date, your co de', can't look in your face
what's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
and he never crossed you, but you claimin he's fam'?
what's trust, when you get bust, your n****z don't retaliate?
they blaze purple haze with em the next day?
god forbid one of my n****z get hit, i'ma go haywire
won't hesitate, i'ma spray fire
but everybody's different, you won't know how you react
til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
the hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
you was hungry when you stuck duke, he came back to buck you
who's wrong? foul all your life, now you 90
on your deathbed you regret bein grimy
what's lust, a bust nut? what's a thug?
a ghetto child raised around drugs, til he's old enough to bust slugs?
then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a n**** worse
when he come home to catch another case?
life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
you did it, heaven or hell or prison
who knows when your clock'll stop tickin, get your weight up
save up before it's over neighbor, i told ya
you gettin older player, look at those who gave up"

f*** who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary
and my mentality is, money orientated
i'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
but somethin must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
now some, restin in peace and some are sittin in san quentin
others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition
keepin the schwepervesence street ghetto essence inside us
cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
but as long as we leavin thievin we'll be leavin with some kind of dough
so, and to that day we expire and turn to vapors
me and my capers ll be somewhere stackin plenty papers
keepin it real, packin steel, gettin high
cause life's a b**** and then you die
chorus: az the visualiza
life's a b**** and then you die; that's why we get high
cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a b**** and then you die; that's why we puff lye
cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a b**** and then you die; that's why we get high
cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a b**** and then you die; that's why we puff lye
  > chorus #1 echoes at the end
cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a b**** and then you die
  > chorus #2 includes these lines, echoes at the end
verse two: nas
i woke up early on my born day, i'm twenty years of blessing
the essence of adolescent leaves my body now i'm fresh in
my physical frame is celebrated cause i made it
one quarter through life some god ly like thing created
got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
load up the mic and bust one, cuss while i puffs from
my skull cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain
don't go against the grain simple and plain
when i was young at this i used to do my thing hard
droppin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
and got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
now it's all about cash in abundance, n****z i used to run with
is rich or doin years in the hundreds
i switched my motto    instead of sayin f*** tommorrow
that buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
once i stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
i cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
time is illmatic keep static like wool fabric
pack a four matic that crack your whole cavity
chorus"
"ah yeah, what's happening, mami
how ya doin' baby. oh you lookin kinda good and everything, i see you with those stilhettos baby. ah, check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me? ay, let me put this bug in your ear, baby. won't you turn those flow shoes into your ho shoes, ya dig. yeah check this out. this universe fine as your royal highness. you know what, i can do a whole lotta things for you. guess why? cause i'm a motherf***in' pimp.

hustlin' and gridning baby

stayin' on that paper chase
in this life, there's pimp's and ho's
tell me which one are you, you little
like me
hustlin' and gridning baby
i be
stayin' on that paper chase
the good man in me say get money and stay on the path.
but the pimp shit in me say, yo, keep looking for ass
but my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
a little city in water, when you shake it, it snow.
i told her never let a sucker n**** take off her clothes
better wait till you're grown, when they love you, you'll know.
everybody's got a dream, i hope and wish to own a six times two
chill in the whip a fantasy a bone to pick to get against who i don't know
to one who said you won't blow
you won't eat, you want cake, they mistake.
blamin me for they failures i'm fresh.
getting tailored, single breasted.
a lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit.
a woman hates a man and stay with him for many years. tell him she loves then be jealous of him. now lame is how the ghetto judge him. cause he still with her. she take his cash and give it to some other real n****.
like me"
"i never wanted you to be my man
i just need your company
don't want to get dependent on
your time or who you spend it on
or lose the way you love me
like smoke, i hung around
and be your balance
it's not a movie, this is not a script to proofread
i'll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
tryna punctuate the funds i make amounts i take
put in your face oh, my mistake
you're not a floozy? then excuse me
before i talk, my style introduced me
get your name and phone number like 1 2 3
y'all know the story, y'all know the commentary
i kick the narrative, this is legendary
the good samaritan, good thespian
like a polygamist, with a twist
will i marry again? maybe, i guess
i hold a lady's interest, i just met
the love scholar, she the teacher's pet
every other eve we'd meet and make each other sweat
i feel triumph with no strings
just a fling to have fun with
i be out in london, camden
huntin' for the answers, why did god take away the homie?
i can't stand it
i'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
just hope the big man show me some courtesy
why? 'cause i'm deemed a heartbreaker
like smoke, girls linger 'round a player
yeah yuh
i never wanted you to be my man
i just need your company
don't want to get dependent on
your time or who you spend it on
or lose the way you love me
like smoke, i hung around
and be your balance
yo, this recession is a test
it's affecting my complexion
misdirecting my affection
my concerns of bill collections
the facts is the taxes, they after me
chapter three, my property
my handlers, they dealt with me improperly
i say some things i should probably keep privately
evaluate the world bank trusts like i'm ieg
this fly sweet bourgeoisie
tall freak, she wouldn't protest with me at wall street
she says, no you're so deep
i said, no let's go thru it
historically so ruthless feds came for joe lewis
she said, my man you needs to laugh sometime
classifies me as a bore, i told her have some wine
you colder than penguin p**** at her her dismay
she's thinkin' that's just so silly to say
but if you really think about it hussy
see a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
and there's a drag
and it's a bust and you're in tune with just lust
i'm thru with you after i crush, so is that humorous enough?
the smoke i puff
tell the car to go to aura, funky buddah, whiskey mist
on mayfair
i hope i meet some monie loves so she can show me love
nyc to uk i might stay there
everybody in the club tonight say, ""yeah""
you know how me and amy are, straight players
i never wanted you to be my man
i just need your company
don't want to get dependent on
your time or who you spend it on
or lose the way you love me

yo, yo, i live it and i speak it
my religion is reefer
big money in most, an uninhibited freak to sleep with
my visions are realistic, nothing's figurative
i can wish it into existence, god want this n**** to live
blunt big as a dread, i get high and forget who bled
who we stomp kicked in the head and who we left for dead
who are you n****s? why argue n****s?
the truth is the truth, i really put my scars on n****s
they wait a lifetime, they tell they hoes, ""nas did this""
pointin' to they scars like, ""right here, baby, really nas did this""
like a badge of honor, not braggin' i'm just honest
war stories we tell them, nothin's realer than karma
sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
rap jack demsey, matt black bentley, pimply
shatterin' your silence, pass around the chalice
due to my indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
official kings and gents is who i mix and mingle with
f*** your ice, i rock rubies, amethyst
i f*** your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous
this for my bad hood b****es, ghetto glamorous
yo, what we talkin' 'bout n****s?
what we talkin' 'bout n****s?
this is nas, what, nas
what, nasty, what, recollect,
at seventeen i made seventeen thousand livin' in public housin'
integrity in tact, reppin' hard
they askin' how he disappear and reappear back on top
sayin', ""nas must have naked pictures of god or somethin'""
to keep winnin' is my way like francis
as long as i'm breathin', i'll take chances
a soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
so much to write and say, yo i don't know where to start
so i'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
i know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
but my life been good since i started finding peace
i shouldn't even be smilin', i should be angry and depressed
i been rich longer than i been broke, i confess
i started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
like trump bein' up down up, play with cash
my n****'s like a locomotive
nas, we push it, mush 'em
queensbridge to bushwick
harlem, bronx, all that
you ain't even supposed to be out here
you know where you at?

at night, new york, eat a slice too hot
use my tongue to tear the skin hangin' from the roof of my mouth
shit was falicimo, melted pot, city sweltering hot
staggerin' drunker than those cops that 2pac shot
i was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed
reachin', soon as i heard them iron wheels screechin'
when it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
toker man safe behind a locked door for sure
minor theif shit, minor league shit, beastin'
lookin' for the young, but now we older chiefin'
in my truck, play the greatest adventures of slick rick
buggin' on how his imagination was so sick
it's ghetto beef, sinister n****s snicker through yellow teeth
alchohol agin' my n****s faster than felonies
how dare i? must be, somethin' in the air that corrupts me
look at my upkeep, owned and sublease

smackin' up the dude with the gun, take the jewels and the funds

ram shacking it, found four ratchets, dea jackets, we gotta escape the madness

there's an obstacle in everything, it's all natural, i'm keepin' it pilin'
keepin' heat with the silencers

underground tapes, that's my ascap and publishing stakes

i been gettin' criticized, it's keepin' me energized
create with a business mind, i'm from where killers reside
a wild hood, only knew goons since my childhood
n****s say anything in they raps 'cause it sound good

we don't respect fake jewellery and silly outfits

why would i?
for real talk, the n**** who killed hip hop for real is nas, dog
that n**** killed hip hop, hip hop is dead
that n**** went and told everybody about it
he came out publicly and said, ""hip hop is dead"""
"aight f*** that shit, word word

i rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
henessey holders and old school n****z, then i be dissin a
unofficial that smoke woolie thai
i dropped out of kooley high, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
jungle survivor, f*** who's the liver
my man put the battery in my back, a differencem from energizer
sentence begins indented.. with formality
my duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology
poetry, that's a part of me, r*****edly bop
i drop the ancient manifested hip hop, straight off the block
i reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
childhood lesson make me see him drop in my weed smoke
it's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines
the hype vice, murderous nighttimes, and knife fights invite crimes
chill on the block with cog nac, hold strap
with my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
no sign of the beast in the blue chrysler, i guess that means peace
for n****z no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
start off the dice rollin mats for craps to cee lo
with sidebets, i roll a deuce, nothin below peace god    now the shit is explained
i'm takin n****z on a trip straight through memory lane
it's like that y'all .. it's like that y'all .. it's like that y'all
chorus: repeat scratches 4x
""now let me take a trip down memory lane""  > bizmarkie
""comin outta queensbridge""
one for the money
two for p**** and foreign cars
three for alize n****z deceased or behind bars
i rap divine gods check the prognosis, is it real or showbiz?
my window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
a nickel plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
your telephone blowin, black stitches or fat shoelaces
peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo' fo' i let blow
and back down po po when i'm vexed so
my pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
i see dark streets, hustlin brothers who keep the same rank
pumpin for somethin, some uprise, plus some fail
judges hangin n****z, uncorrect bails, for direct sales
my intellect prevails from a hangin cross with nails
i reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
word to christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
i decifer prophecies through a mic and say peace.
i hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
they spoke of fat cat, that n****'s name made bell rings, black
some fiends scream, about supreme team, a jamaica queens thing
uptown was alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
f*** 'rap is real', watch the herbs stand still
never talkin to snakes cause the words of man kill
true in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
i pour my heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
chorus
""comin outta queensbridge""  > scratched
the most dangerous mc is..

"'bout it, that's how i feel we used to all put in and go half on bail money
f*** makin' it rain, now we makin' it hail money 
i never met muhammed ali, wish i did
my brother saw him, champ told him nothing is real
gave me the chills, thought about it, that's how i feel
we on autopilot, no captain behind the wheel
my whole career, i steered away from features
but i figured it's perfect timing to embrace new leaders
accepted my position as the master teacher
i make cash deposits before the first
flashy diamonds, that's waterworks
sassy models thе curviest
brothers you knew from thе sandbox'll do you the dirtiest
government assistance, poverty is big business
overrun the senate, both parties got policies built for the wicked
look in the jungle, you gotta move like an animal
prey on the predators, go where anybody that challenge you
board rooms, courtrooms, it'll leave you with war wounds
i ain't wanna be this cold hearted but i was forced to
wore my sneakers like run dmc did
important to black culture like spike lee is
he got game, i wish my mom could see this
see the man that he is, moments you can't relive
like takin' your first swim
like still bein' a virgin
taking trainin' wheels off the rims
movin' in ya first crib or having your first kid
moments you can't relive
like your first time buggin' from somethin' that nas said
yo, i wish i met sister souljah, but i didn't
woulda told her coldest winter ever was beautifully written
she alive so she'll hear this
i'm dolo, no co defendants, i been with the social distance
archbishop of sharp spittin', sports car whippin'
ya actin' like the real ain't what's needed, of course i get it
what's more authentic?
hit boy in a walking guinness world record, new york menace
i'm o dog, hit is caine, the endin' change
traded my youth some say i became a suit
a representative of martin' dream comin' true
every man is a king 'less he make excuses
wish that my mishaps wasn't a nuisance
sunday to sunday, get praise, i'm god made
where i'm from, one go in the grave, one go in the cage
moments you can't relive
like takin' your first swim
like still bein' a virgin
taking trainin' wheels off the rims
movin' in ya first crib or having your first kid
moments you can't relive
like your first time buggin' from somethin' that nas said
third verse and i knew what to write
they say i'm a legacy artist, i blew up the price
thirty years later, who woulda knew dude would be nice?
i hit the tables and i threw up the dice
under the lights, outside dining, al fresco
silk is the dress code, had to be esco
colors of lightbulbs change through voice command
flew over antigua, made the choice to land
set my feet on a private island, house come with a staff
chef know how to cook with no salt and low fat
extended stay shorty, she don't wanna go back
you gotta appreciate the moments, bad times don't last
like my first fistfight in the 'bridge
hype like the first time i heard nobody beats the biz
those times bring me to tears, moments you can't relive
 yeah
like takin' your first swim like still bein' a virgin taking trainin' wheels off the rims
movin' in ya first crib or having your first kid moments you can't relive like your first time buggin' from somethin' that nas said
just free livin' this life
i can't relive last night
i'm excited for today"

"music for life lyrics
nas
yeah, yeah
it started with rhythms i heard listenin to the wall
the bouncin of basketballs on playgrounds and all
the empty bottles is hollow wind blowin inside em
the flow and the rhymin got my alignment to a science
mixing with my moms in the kitchen, them spoons rattling
pots and pans, faucet water pouring tunes managing
to come from all the fussing and ramballing what i know this was, pure music untampered with
and all them f***in things showbiz does
older thugs showed us stuff, like how to hold a plug
juice from the street life it almost could have blowed us up
crates of records, great sessions, had the whole hood jammin
large speakers fresh made smell the wood sandin
father did his blues, smooth legendary jazz man
saw his wife secondary to his true passion
started with my crew rappin
new jacks in 82
never look back now look what it changed me to, music
marsha we gotta believe the future, we gotta believe the past
we gotta believe in more, they know that we have
we gotta believe each other, we gotta open up our minds
coz music is for life
hi tek
whats the difference between me and you
is im a real cognisor of this rap shit i really do it
my whole life man is really music
through my bass line im living through it
another expression of life i couldnt live without
i like my music straight pure not watered down
damn it feels good to fulfil my dreams of getting out the hood
kept me busy, gave me a chance to stop selling drugs
spending time in the basement kept me from acktin up
zoneing out, wishin dre could check it out
im here now
i cant believe the proof in the pudding, everything happen for a reason
through this music im able to feed my family
when im stressed out its my sanity
its a life style, all on the street, in here hollywood
music in my dna, its my lively hood, music
chorus
common
keep the music alive
the good and the strong survive
i close my eyes and imagine i was jackson 5
randy and michael going through lifes cycle
music allowed me to let life go
so vital to a youngster comin up amoung street hustlers
the big beat would touch us in such a special place
given the ghetto a taste of what freedom is like
i reached the point in my life when i was needing a mic
no second guessing, self expression, and lessons learned
aggression became sessions where sess was burned
put my soul into it, now my feet is firm
in the game where a name is hard to earn
and hot cats careers get scarred and burned
through the years mine took a godly turn
this is the story of my life man trapped in the verse
no matter money or the movies, music is first
not sure if its all right but i couldnt find this any where so i decided to do it myself"
"ayy hit, we gon' do some shit like this my n****
yea though i walk through the valley of infidels, suckers
who adhere to sucker religions
life's a bible
we livin' in biblical times
uh, first chapter
this chapter called ""men""
given knowledge by the psychotic, the block was college
we don't add it up then that shit'll leave us divided
it's sorta like ten commandments
i'm talkin' 'bout men and standards, i'm tryna reverse the damage
you boys obsessed with cameras, the debt we was handed
so many move like judas, look at the past, it's proven
it's my duty to speak truth to power
i be feelin' like it's my fault
around your enemies, then they call you before you hear about it
talk to you like it's still love, keepin' your vision clouded
tryna get cool with guys 'cause you want 'em to choose sides
campaignin' with the haters, dismissin' truth for lies
definition of a man, don't fold on the stand
for your soul, the exec' let you hold an advance
don't be discouraged, just go with the plan
gotta have faith in god's grace over the land
and i pray for the day when they lay down
and caged make their way up out that maze
get their mind up out a daze
too many mamas layin' flowers at they graves
don't rap about death, it's power in what you say
second chapter, and you get what you give
it's power in how you live, i sit and talk with the kids
and tell 'em just how it is, go straight to avoid the bids
livin' fast can wait, stay down and work on your grades
speak gospel for the next generation
you can have it all, just don't side with satan
i seen that take down most of the greatest
hotel suites, hollywood stars hangin'
the other side of what you think is fly
your jewelry could be cursed and so can your ride
let that soak in your mind, suburbans and beamers
shot up with ninas, how to stop a young genius
spiritual like a deep cut from shirley caesar
i wonder if it's jesus when a baby reach up
sharpenin' up myself 'cause i know they need us
my african skin gave me the passion to win yeah, prayin' this doesn't come to a tragic end 
third chapter
this chapter called ""women"", y'all been the rib since the beginnin'
a woman's intuition, is what a man is missin'
to understand your wisdom is something i had to learn
somehow you the most unprotected on planet earth
your smile lift me up and your eyes kiss my soul
your sweetness is honeycomb, such a lovely tone
you hold the power to make a house a home
because of you, i wanna right my wrongs kiss your mother 'cause we only get one a grandmother's words to her grandson
beautiful minds develop in time checks every month 'cause you held me for nine
they might see an image of a woman who's flawed
but i see a woman in the image of god
highest regards, i light a cigar
to men, women and children, my bible is ours 
open it up, listen to it in anytime
that revelations' vibe, get you through it
ain't none of us perfect, i damn sure ain't
prayin' this doesn't come to a tragic end
we just gon' hope for the best and do our best
and be our best, no less, yeah
yo, i woke up this morning
had to pray to god and thank him 'cause i made it this far
i kept it me, i'ma stay me no matter what
no matter who change up
i'ma try to get 'em to see the right path
'cause i think i'm on the right path"
"american born, american raised, american made
my country shitted on me she wants to get rid of me cause the things i seen cause the things i seen 
it was packed on the ryker's bus
the tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled
the life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
on the streets i was invincible
cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
what my pistol would do, a f***in' killa
mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me
all in front of my friends
in the street smile with no teeth
i never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
why didn't my folks just die in this society
why wasn't i a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
two little brothers, two sisters, them shortiez gots to eat
mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
i'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
it comes to me slowly, the words he would cry
it is i that step up
me that don't give a f***, you that bold, then it's all over soldier
hummers and range's through the desert
f*** a 20 inch, long as we got gas and we got water
troopers lookin' for manslaughter
i gotta get back, for what they owe
shoot'em in the back for the get back
lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
forget the life had, now we all rebels
everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
we can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
and debris from the earth as we knew crumble
yo you could see the sea
and the stars look closer to me
i'm a mad man, this is a real life movie mad max
s k's, ak's max, abr's spittin' and it ain't a rap
my mommy dearest pray for me hopin' i come back
but yo
yo, i'm sittin' behind these prison walls
i got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, god
brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
some brothers innocent, i pray that i could just escape
how is the war
and yo i'm wishin' i was in your shoes
holdin' machine guns
clean fun shootin' dudes with fatigues on
anywhere is better than this
it's america's plan every color of man inherits the shit
yo i'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
i know the warden is readin' the scribe
 but yo i swear, it's a billion dollar business
courts, lawyers and jails
we all slaves in this system, i'm bout to rebel
there's not a b**** in sight
all block bench, all block gates
all gray fence, look who f***ed it all up, mr. president
i remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
now it's state of the art
i just saw the first dude i met here, his head came apart
what a bloody mess, a slug fest
i just buried 8 of mine, at night i hear grown man cryin'
you know i'm spittin' mine
i ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
everytime i hear the wind i think a slug went in
i'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
smokin' this grass, beatin' my d***, thinkin' of ass
i don't know what they broadcast, the news flash is fake
everyday i'm feelin' like you, i wanna escape
and if y'all n****s feelin' like me, y'all n****s just say"
"word to will, buried in his fila suit and heavy chain
i wanna be iced up n****, bury me the same
i live for street glory and i die for ghetto fame
respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
initials in swimming pools floors, women lose draws
a true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
guns under beds, mask and a flashlight
living my life like everyday's my last night
alcoholic on toilets, i shit blood
foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
mama told me from weed, i would switch drugs
to cocaine and hit clubs and deep dish dubs
how would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack on
back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
bopping to the supremes, smoking joints
that's cool, but i'ma live how i want
i did it my way, from crumbs and roaches and rats
i did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
i did it my way, from break dancing, back spins on the cardboard
i did it my way, to bullet proof bentleys, gats in the car's door
i did it my way, never gave a f*** what nobody said
i did it my way, they hope that i fail and wished i was dead
i did it my way, if i f***ed op it falls on me
i did it my way, i'm lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat
gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
juzzi's, gucci soap, throwing cash in the air
though i, still feel broke with millions in the bank
and deals on the table, i focus to stay afloat
and just to think some would die to get with i got
they think its alot, the blink of an eye, you could get shot
n****s is wolves, coming if you ruthless or not
but i be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
never knew murder till i seen my man get popped
no blood soaking, laying there, eyes still open
i got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
he was looking right through me, yo staring beyond
i wonder what he saw, the limoes, movies and tours
did he die in vain and represent for the cause
now i put his name on everything i'm involved
and that's the game, ya'll can't relate, f*** ya'll 
i did it my way, from crumbs, roaches and rats
i did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
i did it my way, i call it how i see it n****s
i did it my way, if you don't like it so be it n****s
i did it my way, i make my own rules, i do my own plans
i did it my way, gangstas do what they want
suckers do what they can't
i did it my way, taking sacrifices kid
i did it my way, but now you only getting one life to live
yo, hoes in my fold can slow me, roll with the brokest homies
cold and we hopeless lonelies, scolding my foes who phony
from blocks where coke can feed you and cops are over evil
they know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesil
here on and blow it rurals, its mine, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to caroline and blew big time
in just two years, their crew disappear
snitches and b****es, smeared the paint on their pictures
years back, i reminiscence and remember, sitting on wood benches
gave me splinters, just a baby n**** thankful
when them killers came through, guns out, moving
i think the ones who said shorty go home, we about to be shooting"

we were scholars long before colleges
they say we n i double g e r, we are

the obvious, we are the slave and the master
what you lookin for? you the question and the answer
we trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
powdered eggs and government cheeses
the calendars with martin, jfk and jesus
gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
summers, coolin off by the fire hydrant
yeah i'm from the ghetto
where old black women talk about their sugar level   it's not unusual
to see photos of dead homie's funerals
aluminium foil on tv antennas
little tv sit on top the big tv, eating tv dinners
girls die their hair with kool aid
they gave us lemons, we made lemonade
but this n****'s payed, ancestral slaves
descendant of kings, it's necessary i   bling
put rims on everything, where tims on every scene

bought patterns consist of boss matters
spit moses' lost commandments like a growth sandwich out my mouth
toast to government cameras peepin us, every week i must
have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs

they see me from skinny to fatter, when i rap about war
they got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
so now my enemies are at my front door
cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
they callin it reverse racism
still to this day the streets torn   my brother jung'
i'll always have a seat for him   not behind me, beside me
you'll always know where to find me
they say the close ones will hurt you
so let's keep a small circle
on the road to riches and diamond rings
in the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king"
"uhh
yo, yo yo, y'all
whattup? whattup
it's time man straight up, it's time man
aight, set that shit off
broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
neighbors, look at every bag you bring through your doors
lock the top lock, momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator
why not? it might've saved later from my block
n.y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin
stitches in they head, stinkin and i dread thinkin they be snitchin
but who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
parked in the dark    narc's, where's your heart?
hustlers starve; they bust a u e i jog
to my building    come out later wearin camouflage
see the sergeant and the captain    strangle men
n****z gaspin for air; til they move no more and just stare
with dead eyes    tired of riots, shit is quiet
simple minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant
father's on drugs, moms is smokin, beds is piss infested
had eight partners growin up, eight turned to seven
seven turned to six n****z, got two in heaven
six of us, holdin it, now it's five rollin thick
the sixth one's parole flipped; five n****z, went to fo' quick
when he went o.t., college life, converted into gangbangin
four n****z still hangin, years passed and slang changin
three of us now, fourth n**** ain't around
we all thought he was real    he did the snake shit
fake shit    beat his ass down, yo his mouth

young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
b****es and n****z both on parole or probation
shit is sick, n****z got gats, army fatigues
i got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in the lead
cause i ain't playin, n****z'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
stick yo' ass up, n****z'll find the loot in your kicks
bunch of triple cross n****z, just new york n****z
lift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you
some of these dudes the feds be on em, you knew em for years
be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers

f***** ass n****z that be scared to do they bids

all of a sudden we got crips and bloods, d.t.'s
runnin round quick to split your mug, it's ea sy to score
but it's hard to get the shit off
n****z fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off

"it ain't hard to tell, i excel and prevail
the mic comes in contact with the third rail
my raps react, they attack the wack just like a maniac
with this, see i'm a brainiac
i call you tattoo, you never come off
i flip the script with a sawed off, boss
a modern shakespeare   reincarnated
brains are elevated, i'm bein r rated
this style is terror, drastic
meltin the plastic, and i eat mics just like acid
burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not
cause i be packin like a rasta in a weed spot
hittin your heart with a hollow tip verbally illin
minds minipulated, my raps are nickel plated
i execute raps like i'm swingin an axe around
this is a mic shut down
notify the president   that i'm bombin your residence
and i'm leavin no evidence
voice box yells, lyrics will excel
rappers gettin smoked, you can smell the hot shells
your style is fake snake, well dramatized
you might as well be a singer but ain't harmonize/harmin nas
here's the break, i can translate lyrics so well
i excel, it ain't hard to tell
it ain't hard to tell..
i got a case of vocal fever, i'm here to make you a believer
nas wrecks the tweeters and recievers
lyrics will explode, my brain overloads
gimme a grammy competition is dead just like sammy
i leave minds magnetized like slaves
your style is old fashion like waves
holdin a pistol at a pastor, pullin the trigger faster
tell 'em i was sent by his master
but that topic's too deep for your ear
here's the science you can comprehend clear
advanced intellectual, a time bomb speeder
i'll pull your whole card   just like a palm reader
non stop, i'm bustin heads like the feds baby pops
this is not the +kindergarten cop+
put on your blindfold, i'ma release and stand tall
i detonate bombs at the policeman's ball
this is art from the heart, i leave 'em marked for death
in each breath in this game i'm the ref
already i'm ill but i can only get better
with lyrics as pretty as a nickel plated beretta
i master dialects, of uncommon languages
a black man caught by the klan couldn't hang with this
these are proverbs, copy cat attackers
i'm wanted dead cause i'ma genocide to rappers
battlin nas is dead when my brain reacts
yyu might as well have fell asleep on a train track
this ain't the same track that you're used to
this is rhythmatic automatic, try it you oughta have it
slaughter your tape recorder; givin thanks to my supporters
and keep flowin like water
no matter the obstacle, nasty nas will prevail
aiyyo, it ain't hard to tell
it ain't hard to tell..
check it
i catch wreck with my intellect, suckers are incorrect
i'm gonna win cause you slept
on nas, word is bond, i leave the microphone torn
false rappers, you need to write your own song
metaphors of murder man, hittin like roberto duran
hold the mic in my hand, my life span
imitators will sweat me like gym class
your raps are fat?shit, then i'll be slim fast
new rap recruits i salute then delete 'em
verbally eat 'em, because my ears don't need 'em
nas is a terrorist, analyst
swingin my fists like a n**** breakin, posessed by satan
you couldn't compete with a beat that was fast or slow
brothers is gettin shipped out like i was castro
i can eat your flavor but i'm not a candy lover
i use a +lethal weapon+, just like danny glover
execute monologues, sabotage entourage
mutilate mics like a maniac in bars
i talk with slang, and use my brain
generate pain, penetrate your vein
move like a maniac, nas is nice son
talk to your concience and hit like tyson
no competition, cause i cause wonders
nas will battle rappers by the football numbers
a motor mouth killer, rhyme writin thriller
hold a mac 11, and attack a reverand
don't sleep cause you might not wake
i speak deep, dialects i translate
queens prince, commit sins on the regular
murder my competitors, and et cetera
nas is a gypsy egyptian
flippin' the script'n microphone manufacturers are victims
my voice makes your ear drums swell..

big living, what it tastes like, tapes right, used to hate life

pipe bombs safe from stashes, aston's, rolls royces
cold oysters and many sorts of women shake like horses
i got them peeling out their clothes, really about this dough
problem, hear me out just scone from my pistol poppin'
it's at my mind, just a mystery school
brainwash them, then fix them with my tools

solar energized rides, no steering wheel, tell it how to drive
no propellers in the sky
airplanes like many rockets
waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit mars
while the poor people starve, computers takin over they jobs
a man's forced to live off land
now it's back to the caveman era
when we made fire, by two sticks rubbin together
the truth is, many are too scared of new data
america online, cut off, see you later

bill clinton's the new jfk, without the hole in his dome
the new don trump is bill gates
not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake
and cake mean his stock, net gross
young kids step it up, go for the most
new cameras in police cars takin pictures
new hustlas gettin new street figures
and us embassies overseas
almost every foreign country's under seige
covertly startin wars, cia, navy seals
commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
oil in the earth spills
girls blow they body up, birth control pills
african's pick diamonds out a dark caves

yeah, it's been a few sightings of me, a fair amount
never seen much, but yet i'm never in the house
move with style, wild exciting when i do step out
y'all been rhyming for years and jungle made a hit
oochie wally idea, sold a million records
had 'em embarrassed, signed to colombia
blew a check, he was laughing
while y'all in the studio bragging 'bout your past and
thinking back on trips to manhattan, dad was rollin'
hotels like the plaza, black bell hops holding rich people' bags
tip they hats to old men coming out of cabs
limousine, holding doors for them
we all got a job to do, go for it
no bad energy please, no bad energy
no bad energy please, no bad energy
no bad energy please, no bad energy
no bad energy please, no bad energy
to rappers who never sold crack, telling other peoples lives
never shot anybody, but be shootin' people in they rhymes
never robbed nobody or re upped with coke in they ride
i'm probably who they talkin' 'bout when they writin' most of they lines
and i ain't notice it, trappin' was what was happening, with bolder clique
around me, i'm surrounded by the most devoted clique
we saw the smokers get rowdy for all the potentness
and still ain't know how sick it was in that ocean abyss
what doesn't come out in the wash comes out in the rinse

what you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
that means you inferior, not major
if n****z could look inside my mind, you'll find
where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
go to the center, enter with caution, past the braincell graveyard
where weed's responsible for memory loss
let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
see what i seen every day i live with this torture
lightin spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
my tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
long as i'm still breathin i'm still winnin, i'll teach 'em

your part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
while on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
but it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
from, czechoslovakia to texas metropolis
them, treacherous rocksters in the mexican mafias
be scrappin with tats on they back, violent wars
nothin less than a lethal injection if ever caught
courtrooms, eagles and flags, american style
while in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
watchin for paint chips, don't want no led in yo' child
but them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
the chain be like a hundred k

how they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact
real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
whores charge n****s with raping
cause we come out doors of maybach cars
watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars
so they counter the laws to take what's ours

"lotta times it seem like you aint gonna make it where you wanna be in life
but yo, yo if ya gotta plan
believe me you gonna get there
you gonna get everything you ever wanted baby, thas ma word
trust, ma n****s come home from long bids
they check for me before they see their own kids
i open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tour in
major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
cop ferraris with navigational screens
guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to queens
piped out seats, oakwood mb cord speakers
bumpin' out old shit
that made me think of old easters '86 in a le tigre short sleeves
lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' f***ed up
from old e, fresh fest, n****s got hurt
100 n****s rush the door with queensbridge tournament shirts
back then, nobody wore a vest
pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
get your pumas took, come home barefoot willin'
look at the chain i snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'
half of the crew probably on the island
project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
playin' corners stick the elevator never thought
project life was promised nothin' but to die trife
for steppin' on the next man's nikes my motto look for tomorrow
today is yesterday look at the hood now, i'm mad that it turned out that way
gats spray these shorties is killers
the older g's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
and they look at me like i'm on the outside lookin' in
like 'who's you' when i cruise through
i call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever
everything will eventually come to an end
so try to savor the moment, cuz time flies don't it
the beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
cuz nothin' lasts forever
everything will eventually come to an end
so try to savor the moment, cuz time flies don't it
the beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
cuz nothin' lasts forever
nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'
poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'
gucci iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs
one for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs
rolls royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
pool parties beautiful view
you made it in life, forbes magazine style baggy jeans style
pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
louis roderra with peach schnapps you just relaxin'
thinkin' damn wish my n****s could afford this
on the sand at your malibu house holdin' a cordless
talkin' to lawyers accountants investments
money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested
worries of failure, when you buried will your familia
keep your name prosperin' to the maximum
you should live, there's only one life that's the physical
rich or poor in jail why the f*** should you be miserable
things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion
the b**** you love could start to hate you, the shit you use to do escape you
things that make you laugh represent the past
reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
n****s use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
turn 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real
everything must eventually come to an end
so try to savor your moments, cuz time flies don't it
the beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
cuz nothin' lasts forever, ya know
i said everything eventually comes to an end
so try to savor your moments, cuz time flies don't it
the beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
cuz nothin' lasts forever
ya know, ya now, nothin' lasts forever ya know let it go, let it go"

mistakes want me, sauve fellow but raunchy
the soul of a cold body haunts me, i flee the country
but only to shed tears for years
too wild for my own self, hopin help is near
street fightin was cool but in school i brought a new tool
toolin with the devil, a rebel, a fool

and watch a flick, illin and root for the villian, huh
plus every morning, i go out and love it sort of chilly
then i send a shorty from my block to the store for phillies
after being blessed by the herb's essence
i'm back to my rest, ten minutes some odd seconds
that's where i got the honey at, spends the night for sexing
cheap lubrication, lifestyle protection
picking up my stereo's remote control quickly
ron g's in the cassette deck, rockin the shit, g
i try to stay mellow, rock, well acapella rhymes'll
make me richer than a slipper made cinderella fella
go get your crew, hobbes, i'm prepared to bomb troops

floating like i'm on the north 95 interstate
never plan to stop, when i write my hand is hot
and expand alot from the wiz to camelot
the parlayer, i'll make ya heads bop pah
i shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
from day to night, i play the mic and you'll thank god
i wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
my brain is incarcerated
live at any jam, i couldn't count all the parks i raided
i hold a mac 11, and attack the reverand
i contact 11 l's and max in heaven
outro: nas, large professor, and ?

taught us right n****
my old dad imported to the family structure
provide her god
my moms a queen at university civaliza
my pops maybe was late but always came home
my moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
soon as he walk in the door she barking
i turned out the jonny carson
jumped out the bed
we grabbed both his legs
me and my brother
not knowing the pain he gave my mother
night after night, fighting yelling at each other
my papa played the street all day
mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way
she sacrifices all she got to feed us
when she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding
but still i didn't see it
mama hid it from us
we was kids younger
till we got bigger, on to
bigger things that we knew what the time was
that daddy was leaving the crib and moms love
papa was player, player wasn't papa
papa loved the ladies
never got enough of
pretty brown round
running round town don't tell your mother what's going down
so many kids i knew, never knew what pap was
that's why i show my pop love
he was still around when i f***ed up
he could have left
my moms pregnant shock to death but stayed
watch me crawl till i took my first step, to the first grade
to my first fist fight
right behind me he would stand
no matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man
throw dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam
he watched me so i wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
roaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing
next thing you know he packing
so then i asked him
what's this white shit on that plate and your facing?
papa why you butt ass from the waist
and who's this lady i'm facing
dark skin you're not my mommy
he grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
promise things that he would buy me
if i kept my mouth close and don't tell mommy
he said one day i'll understand little me
was in you to side me
papa was player, player wasn't papa
papa loved the ladies
never got enough of
pretty brown round
running round town don't tell your mother what's going down
pop's told me hold my own
pop's told me value home
could i help it papa was a rolling stone
who loved the pretty brown round
out of town bound
jumping in his jazz benz he touring
at home i play his latest recordings
and it's strange now how, i do my thing now
i'm in the game now
and heard of it his brain pow
to pull strings and gain power
from weed habits are same now
no white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes
and beats that be pumping
before he left he taught me something
a child's young years the most important time to be there
that's why he stayed till we grew up, respect is still here
i'm older now see what having a father's about
one day they can be in your life next day they be out
it's not because of you, you know the deal
him and your moms feel
if they stay together then someone will get killed

get them b****es, left all of them broke, left what they smoke
hoes yellin', 'watch ya back!'
but before i could turn around, before i could i react,
blaow! blaow! blaow! would you look at me now?
is this blood that i feel as i fell to the ground?
feel like a head shot but maybe just grazed my temple
n****s diggin' in my pockets, sayin' i just rolled a pimple
yo, my mouth was movin' but it was nothin' i was sayin'
only if they knew deep inside my mind, i was prayin'
amen
i only pray when shit is f***ed up!
i only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!
i only pray when i need his help the most, what?!
callin' out to someone, somewhere!
yo, is anybody out there?
ain't nothin' stoppin' me   untouchable   hoes, i f***ed a few
style like the greatest, ali   check what the knuckle do
rock bubblegoose to mink, big links,
yellow ice, live the ghetto life, 'f*** y'all think?
bravehearted; f*** around, get graveyarded
dearly departed   the word on the street, i'm a target
i ain't runnin', i ain't hidin', i'm ridin'
i be gunnin', y'all be duckin' and divin'
when i come through buckin' this four fivin'
revenge you sayin' you gettin'
but shit is gettin' too wild, this lifestyle of sprayin' weapons
so i check out the preacher   life is off the meter
thoughts of homicide, tryin' to dodge the reaper
confessions in a church 'cause it hurts, behind a curtain
n**** talkin' to me, but i ain't certain
voice sound familiar so i pulled the shade back
it was this stupid n**** that i popped way back
he set me up, he just got to the preist
i tried to reach but he had his heat pointed my way
and said, 'pray'
""you've got to pray, huh! i mean pray, pray,
and when you pray, you got to look up to the lord, huh!
you got to look up and you got to pray for your children, huh!
you got to pray for that man in front of the liquor store, huh!
you got to pray for that man on the corner! he know he doin' wrong,
but somebody gotta pray for him, huh! you know we doin' wrong,
but we gotta pray for ourselves! you know we are headin'
to this new millennium, goddamnit! they say a comet is comin'
to this world by the year two thousand, i say it's god! it's up to you
to pray to that higher power higher than yourself and humble yourself
and, and, and beg for forgiveness 'cause it comes back to you!
a man told me that while he was in jail, all he did was pray.
all he did was stay in his jail cell and pray to god..."""
"black hoods, cops 'n projects
sewers flooded with foul blockage
the gutter's wild and every child watches
changin top locks with ripped off hinges
doors kicked off, drunks stag off smidoff, wipe your beard off
crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare
vision blurry, cus buried deep in they mind are stories
bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era
he's finished for the rest of his life, till he fades out
the liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
so many ways out the hood but no signs say out
mental slavehouse where gats go off, i show off
n****s up north, prison ology talk, till they time cut off
you should chill if you short, prepare a deep thought
to hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
plan to leave somethin' behind
so your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on
lookin' out of my project window
oh, i feel uninspired
lookin' out of my project window
oh, it makes me feel, so tired
yo, if this piano's the cake then my words are the candles
light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
they lit it up,, hit it up,
now they dismantled, think the whole world is crazy, got a 9
watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in new york
hi satan, united nations quietly taken, to own your soul
take it or leave it, just my evaluation
stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
but to stay awake, cus the scars a razor makes is nothin' in comparison
to the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get in control fast
might as well be, laughin' with malcolm x's assassin as we die slow
perishin', brain dead from a erickson
words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
a cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune
chorus
another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
she said ""go and see the world for myself, and my brother should folla'
pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
sang the blues, guitar strings he played smokin' his kools
the pelican hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
he wrote his music in the back of the crib, i did my homework
at night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
a fight, people screamin' cus somebody pulled a knife out
so i look at this room, i'm hooked to this tune
every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
but jail was ahead of me, the speed and methenfedimines,
reading's what i should've done, cus my imagination would run
i was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
i used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
and i witnessed the murders and police shake downs
yo, the hustlas and hoes, drugs and fo fos
this was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows
oh, outta my window
lookin' out of my project window
oh, it makes me feel, so tired
lookin' out of my project window
oh, i feel uninspired
lookin' out of my project window
oh, it makes me feel, so tired
lookin' out of my project window
oh, i feel uninspired
starin out of, of my window
oh i, feel so tired
oh yeah, outta my window
oh, lookin' out, lookin' out
lookin' out my window, oh yeah
makes me, feel so tired
outta my window, out my project window"

"i see people hating other people
tell me what's the reason
that your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
what's the reason?
by the time of age nine i'm already decidin'
if i can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
or usin' a knife or a gun when i'm twenty one
by by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
and we die then, so i been a young nervous wreck in the projects
watchin' them older n****z pass pot and they high man
i'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
so i would go to school and try to get good grades
teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
so she cussed them, said ""my son ain't no motherf***in' hoodlum""
they judged us, thinking that we dumb 'cause where we come from
got a little older and now i see
young n****z wanted by the powers that be 
i see people hating other people
tell me what's the reason
that your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
what's the reason?
for these wars we're fighting with each other
season after season
when you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
what's the reason?
uh, picture a black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th ave
she never had it, it's not hers to begin with
she gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
i could imagine them askin', what type of human be ing
could leave his family, go back to the carribean?
was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
but daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
a man feels he has to conquer all
the world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know
i can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
'cause this world keeps spinning, yet still i wonder what's the reason
i see people hating other people
tell me what's the reason
when you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
what's the reason?
oooh whoa ooh whoa
i know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
she's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
she called the cops 'cause she hated his mother
now he away doin' numbers, now she g** with her lover
how many n****z gon' die this summer?
i pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
there's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
it's odd, huh? 'cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
he's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills betty shabazz
in her pad while she slept
they said prescott bush funded hitler while the world's in a twister
n****, what you expect? imagine what's next
i see people hating other people
tell me what's the reason
that your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
what's the reason?
for these wars we're fighting with each other
season after season
when you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
what's the reason?
woman harmonizes as nas talks:
""uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
try to conquer all. so what? to all my n****z with they
kids that love they kids, man. all the daddies out there
to all the n****z that died tryin'a figure out what's what
tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. yeah, yeah
ladies forgive us. gotta forgive us. for we know not what
we do. breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
shit. just man... man."""
"i think i can remember some...
brenda the back bender used to have me in the twister
grabbed her up and left her at the buena vista
chelsea used to tell me choke her while i stroke her
stuck a heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement
used to play atari 1200, baby sitter made me kiss her
put hickeys on her stomach
toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch a screw
had her out past her curfew, sheila had this perfume
that drove a n**** wild, was a child then, gertrude
used to put my face in her crotch
spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
eiserea knew i was a player, brought fatima, loud screamer
while i blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
while marvin g**e pumped from the speaker
remember the times i hung with the dimes, remember the times i f***ed a few
remember the times i hung with the dimes, and all the wild things i used to do
remember the times i hung with the dimes, remember the times i f***ed a few
remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you
was only scared of them stds, syphilis, vd and herpes
daffy duck lookin' b**** burnt me, correction
urinary tract infection, what i got for no protection
was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
d*** stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
of a one of a kind sex fiend, justine was luscious wanna cuff us when f***ed us
me and her best friend, this thick texan named tamika, english teacher
wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold out sofa
the weather was cold and loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
under the coat and
put a show on just to show me she loved me
she would undress and wait in zero below weather
in slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high
remember the times i hung with the dimes, remember the times i f***ed a few
remember the times i hung with the dimes, and all the wild things i used to do
remember the times i hung with the dimes, remember the times i f***ed a few
remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you
thank god i got bank god, so f*** pimpin'
f*** broke condoms, pills and penicillin
abortion clinics, i was one of the best who did it
lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
long chin, some with funny odors
long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
some i paid college fees, then they strip tease
and it's sad i don't remember great times that made me drool
and the sex gave me flashbacks when i was like eww
mature with it now dog, here's the side of nas
principles are lined up, things prioritized
se mamma i left that alone, faded memories, the reason that i'm grown
it'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
are we tempted
remember the times i hung with the dimes, remember the times i f***ed a few
remember the times i hung with the dimes, and all the wild things i used to do
remember the times i hung with the dimes, remember the times i f***ed a few
remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you"

"yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, nas, uh, yo, yo
life, they wonder, can they take me under?
nah, never that, nah, yo, yo
i come from the housin tenement buildings
unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
though i owe to it my success
with survival of the fittest, everyday is a chal'
i would think i'm a part of u.s.a. and be proud
confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
like, the darker you are the realer your problems
i reached for the stars but i just kept slippin
on this life mission, never know what's next
ancient kings from egypt, up to julius cezar
had a piece of the globe, every continent
yo, there's asia, africa, europe, france, japan
pakistan, america, afghanstan
yo, there's protestants, jews, blacks, arabics
call a truce, world peace, stop actin like savages
no war, we should take time and think
the bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
but since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fightin
lost lives in the towers and pentagon, why then?
must it go on, we must stop the killin
tell me why we die, we all god's children
all this hate can't last forever it's time that we stand together everybody wants to rule the world world , world , world , world
yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
that's they corner, from new york to california
got blocks locked down
like, ""dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town""
so the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison
at an early age, already know it's against him
so in order for him to survive, one day he must
open up his eyes to the set backs and rise
'cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity
look at what this country's got
there shouldn't be nobody homeless
how can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet
the earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
to all colors increases, to home it belongs
i want land, mansions, banks and gold
the diamonds in africa, oil in my control
the world's natural resources, all its residuals
but then comes foes, i have to gaurd it with missels
and i become the most wanted
but is it worth hearin a million people problems and followed by secret service
i guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
so move over colin powell or just throw in the towel, yo
y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
no other compares to what nas write down
tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
you could get what you love, be a chain in cause
you alive right now
there's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, i'm a hot light now
it's whatever man think of manifest to the real
the plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
all this hate can't forever last
all my ghetto heroes in heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
you just transcend, i know i'm gon' see you again
hopin i reach the world leaders and win
ain't nothin without struggle, listen up, it's critical
we used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
in hip hop, the weapons are lyrical
to be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
top of the world for the kid and unless
poppin any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest
i know the most high hear me, so fly you can't near me
you scared of a mirror, my theory is that   knowledge is power
to every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now
yo, n****s ain't forget shit, know what i'm sayin?
n****s ain't forget nothin man,
the men, women and children killed by the police and shit
n****s ain't gon' forget that, you know what i mean?
yo, what this war just show me is like, whatever you want out of life
whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it
even if that means blood and death
you know, that's what i was raised up on, that's what this country's about"
"in a day of 1999 it had to happen
the result of man's stupidity became real
death smell is everywhere
in their nicely worked out war plan
through the sky come rockets down there people are scored
everybody does try to save his own everywhere in town
on the run the people turn to animals
love and hate does not exist here more
no more hope
which led to the world's last breath
fire does control our world till the end
go fight stand up if you are not scared
tell them the people are dead
the merciless radioactivity spread real fast
burning skin makes the pain a torture, everybody gets blind
can`t feel hot and cold no more, it is so strange
listen to the people helpless screams, it is too late
moving forward slowly and together we are strong
we will tell them what we are thinking
about their bloody war
and we stop the war and there will be no hate
and we will together rule the world peacefully"
"uh, i knew a few pharmacists, f*** frozen
they kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
the main dude, sekou, face look hard as shit
remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
b****es let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
all red ferari, florida where we met at a redlight
homeboy bumpin' my old shit
they wildin' with some freaks from the islands
piled in behind him, limosine, benz
he shouted, ""nas, roll with us""
i'm bored so i followed him
nikki beach, here's where the scene begins
he put me on to don, nice ass with a set of mean twins
had a pocket full of cash, sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
i was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
then he brings me to his castle in coconut grove
war stories about dudes both of us know
never heard drunken words spoken so slow
a year go by, the n**** was fly
prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
got a call, he's in n.y
needs a couple of g's 'til tomorrow, i dips by
for a season where he's at
greets me with a smile, told him ""here keep that""
next week got a call from his wife
said somebody done took son life
she said
""who gon' hold me down now? hold me down now
tell me that huh    who gon' hold me down now?
who gon' hold me down now? who gon' hold me down?
tell me that huh    who gon' hold me down now""
forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
'cause i always knew the truth, they hated sekou
h2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
left him there on this 'cain, clothes stained with his brain
my soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
arrangement's a closed casket
see now a hoe has to, maintain with his fake gang
sheddin' fake tears, i won't have it
look, this kid's jamaican    half hatian, half asian
brag about how the streets needed a changin'
son, you the only one a b**** could call
you remind me of my dude, help me get them all
nas: ""di sci ple"" *scratched by dj 3x*

yo that shit is cash trust me dunn; i'll never lead you astray
take my word n****z wanna hear how you think
it be that shit that you wouldn't expect to win
that stay playin in they decks over and again
speak your thoughts, put your all in it
whatever's in your mind, spit it
place your anger on the page, release tension on the tape
a stress verse, seem to be what they most thirst
makes fake n****z disperse, they never challenge what works
balancin the weakness, is what i specialize in
dunn you my n**** cause you keep me hype when i'm writin
kept me on point in the night when it might go down
keep me eyes wide in the daytime as well
kept me focused on what's real and nuttin else
i find it healthy, to conversate with myself
i kick it with my delf it's that inner voice you shoulda took head to and shit
coulda been home instead of bleedin
maybe next time you'll listen when it speaks
yo dunn, i got a story to tell
remember last week's mission? i told you bring the gun
 nah listen, without me you'd be a memory
i'm the one you could come to for guidance
bring you home alive when you wildin
kept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray
told you when it's time to put it away
and when the cops came, you was safe
without question, i stay aware dunn i'm listenin
everytime we speak it's real, i know your intention's
to make sure we both safe and livin, and breathin
you gets all respect from me dunn, believe it
yo we got kids to raise and bills to pay
enemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us
 now if you die is they comin?
when you shot do they feel the bullet?
and when you broke can they fix it? aight then, you keep writin
and let me do the thinkin, i brought us this far without mistaken
voices in my head from choices that i dreaded choosin
cautions i shoulda took head, lost in my weed, steady losin
thug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed
whores on they knees, f***in with millionaires, killers and thieves
i f*** until there's no feelin where, i bust and i pee
i lusted cars but i suffered and my scars run deep
i stay to myself, one deep, pray to my god cause he
say when it's hard get on one knee, and ask thy for forgiveness
f*** the cash, the ice, the ferrari's
with two twenty on the dash when your life ain't right
see n****z smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back
snakes shake your hand and got his d*** up in your wife back
why's it like that? it's life black, this is the game
the way i see it both b****es and n****z, is the same
i trust myself, i can't f*** myself
when hoes leave and no weed i still know me, just myself
fear is weakness learn from what experience teaches
beware of leaches, the vampires, my secret's
never follow, cause most n****z is straight up cowards
take care of my body's the temple my mind is the powe"
"yea, back off vacation
time to send y'all pros on a permanent vacation though
check my track record, respect is my black lexus
expect me to act reckless, i'm rich and i'm ass naked
a mink with half leopard, my drinks and my glass separate
i roll and i'm half breathless, just stroll through my last message
like...n****z can't be serious
never that leery shit, shit i'm mysterious
move mystique on 'em, the doses increase on 'em
you ghost if you sleep on 'em
no joke when my peeps stormin
the cars they come in heavy
the god of the serengeti
i charge with a large machete
and carve through ya starvin belly
like...you shoulda known i was serious
still the prettiest, point blank period
feedin while alligators on swamps, got miles and acres
no comp, whether it's freestyle, or written down on papers
so far, i've been down from maybe, a decade, i'm still the raw rest
plus, suede, and ferragamo's, cause the made jury's on us
garments fly apartments, they buggin say nastradamus
just wasn't one of my hardest, sold over a mil regardless
chill with them hard looks, i spark clips
if you blood, or muslim, 5 percent god, or crip
yea, ok
guns in the glove compartment
i'm dapper but love the nonsense
the rappin up of my conscience
i'm strapped when i come to conscious
attack with a hundred monsters
they black and they runnin bonkers
we back and we come to conquer
to master the f***ing genre
like, n****z can't be serious
still the grittiest, point blank period
flow tight as a midget's closet
as tight as a prison block is
no sight of po lice, when we riot
fightin the system, fired
be quiet, when i'm approaching
get tired, jump out the roses
sip meyer's rum out in open
i'm smokin that hydro, choking
i'm scopin, my eyes are on you
don't reach cause i tried to warn you
no street corner nas won't come to
to bomb you, 4 5's will harm you
eccentric, i'm live but calm too
cordial, but crazy cautious
roll through with some crazy gorgeous
hoes, bodies like lady horses

lookin' in that dirt for that ice so blue
then the royal family, the ice goes to
and this thing has to change, feelin' half ashamed

you think about the misery?
the same way we made apartheid history
we can do the same thing to the conflict ice

everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
they wanna shine on 'em

200 thou encrusted watch on my wrist
i wonder how people starve to death
when god bless the land that lacks the harvest
the stone's equality, but they homes are poverty
and the whole world ignores the robbery
bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me
tear drop shaped, uh, perfect clarity
it shocks, so many are killed annually
'cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity
stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
every holiday season, jewelry stores crowded
kids snatched from their homes, mutilated alive
husbands separated from wives, keep a jesus piece to be fly
but back in the day there was a time when they called us shine
everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
they wanna shine on 'em
shine on 'em <   7x"

walked in the house, snatched of they clothes
ran through them hoes
plenty ice that they all seemed to like
can't find my man, heard a blam blam
now i'm wondering, ""in this scam, do i even stand a chance?""
he killed them hoes, took all they doe
fire in his eyes, higher than the sky
comin' down the stairs
now he wantin' mine, reachin for my nine
aiming with our guns at eachothers face, at the same time
my nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, i start whispering
""put your gun down, we skip town""
rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
lift off his chain
took his shit, emptied out close range...

silent, silent
murder
it's sort of like the conclusion, the color purple
n****s is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
grabbing n****s up in this movement to rule shit
cop verses the block, shorties is too quick
lesson number one. if you're arrested and hung
where n****s is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
it's like silent murder, i hit blunts hard like ray mercer
the violent words of a prince in a palace of persia.
the cognac plurger plus the trees,
but whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze,
and got enough gold to rock ice in all hype.
used to be a general but just lost his stripe
pipe dreams and white feinds and all nighters, collect calls from lifers
astoria walls with cypress, since i got a problem with the law writers,
i kick some more items just to explore horizons,
the palm lady dreamt of this day so i'ma play,
the crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay

they say the arms of nicki barnes would be enough to blast,
a lot of rich n****s fell and started pumping gas
was it the mind of cia that bumped off malik shabazz
f*** what they teach in class i'ma reach the mass
strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics
livin' practice, out of line n****s get smacked backwards
so wear it if the cap fits, fold it up money and mad clips
a stack right under my matress
to smoke a n**** like a hugh bros. motion picture
n****s gettin' open cruise, won't be olding n****s
april fools they laugh the jokes on the benches
cease outside my n**** spoke on his sentence
chorus  +
silent
silent, silent
murder
my right handers never play too close to cameras
it's nighttime scanners circle that allow gamblers
peace making n****s pep talk
the peace makin 'n****s walk off the hot avenues with they brew.
time to get this loot countless, 'cuz sun it ain't no youth fountains
n****s take cash and shoot, bounce and pakistanians is took hostage
locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up
what's the flavour when your neighbors do jake favours?
lock them real n****s down and lettin fake players
roam around the project this lyrical logic i dilute,
the weak can object the right composite
we're plottin' all murderous schemes,
it seems i'm ghostly called by the essence of queens
the palm lady dreamt of this day, so i'ma play
the crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay

before security, my dawg had to sneak in the nine
god must be on my side
i had to eat and provide, my winning streak is divine
i told dunn, ""leave the street shit behind
don't let 'em hype you, a slow run beats cheatin' the grind""
dawg, i'm tellin' it like it is, you gotta deal with the consequence
when you run in a n****'s crib, n****, you better be ready to sit
dope dealers, street hustlers, pop cases
throw dice, on pavement, cop chases
big gamblers, skullies, hide faces
gang wars, hot spots, police raid it
left 'em speechless left 'em speechless 
pick a down on his luck rapper, bet he broke
with the arrogance of a crackhead mad at a weed smoker
or a pill taker who hate a distilled wine drinker
a killer who use a gun to hate on a knife swinger
aight, i get it, it's who the littest, we in competition
y'all did it first'll be the death, i got a proposition
you and your brothers stop plottin' on each other, plot on millions
educate yourself, find ten different areas of interest
spread your bets out
double down on what's working then you double up
hands on your paper, they sending hate no matter what you touch
honestly, i'm speechless
fly to greece, twenty pointers on the chain, i freaked it
lawn chair in the hood, sittin' comfortably
i must be insane givin' you bars runnin' companies
i'm done with the redundancies, checking on my history
making content for viacom, license music to tiffany's
i come from
dope dealers, street hustlers, pop cases
throw dice, on pavement, cop chases
big gamblers, scullies, hide faces
gang wars, hot spots, police raid it
left 'em speechless just like when the judge read the sentence
threw your life away in minutes
left 'em speechless the bounce back the greatest feeling
when they thought that you was finished
leave 'em speechless speechless "
"yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah
for n****z up in they mom's crib listenin
to this unadulterated nas shit wishin it was then
instead a, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
jungle of concrete killers and snakes i was amongst that
bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
i want you to vision through my telescope see the hell i wrote
it's reynolds when i wrap it like a envelope package
and they would send the dope back then
numbers, pimpin and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin
but it's small change compare to hip hoppin
and did i mention millions because of lip poppin
trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin
benzes, jeeps, see, them and they b**** got one
it's shockin you thinkin naw it's just rhymin
but all this time it's like organized crimin
for instance, there was a time when there was a line
between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
the beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
the government watchin all of those who thuggin it
they wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin it
not knowin that most rappers are straight ass
the shots ring out, whenever we clash it's star wars
we call it star wars
what happens when the shots ring out, star wars
we call it star wars
caviar never, i rather the cajun blacken
catfish no snails simple n**** to please
met a bad b**** dimples in her cheeks
she remembers busy b battles when it was peace
caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different i thought
n****z was raised off the shit i record
like i was brought up off that planet rock
kurtis blow, james todd smith, shannon scott, larock in the jams
why would they f*** with a don, jehovah witness
him and his co defendants, i eat 'em like lucky charms
with two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
it's nothin mother had a motherf***er
i don't think about it n****z talkin there's a lot of gossip
that i'm a prophet or i can't go back to my projects
can i? does a plant grow from a plant yes
do trees grow from a forest mc's y'all are clitoris
y'all n****z roll with any click that's winnin any crew
doin whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
ain't enough room in this town
what is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, star wars
cause this is star wars, shots ring out everywhere, star wars
cause this is star wars, shots ring out
this ain't, no oscars or mtv or joan rivers fashion police
not what you read in tabloid seats
these are mc's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
because the game was supposed to be sold we livid
came from the streets we the voice of the youth
america's nightmare was given a the mic booth
nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
entertainment, this is our world this is our language
different regions speakin east and west gang shit
you got your positive shit like, common sense
but even he had drama with the don mega cube
acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
what you think is different from the block whenever we feud
f*** your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
don't trust b****es and n****z who tell you your all of that
cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin it's safe
to run in your release party sprayin the place
or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
behind you with your seeds in kay bee toys store
maybe the words get disrespectful now your n****z check you
you 'gon let that n**** play you, you know we 'gon rep you
next mornin every news channel and front page
headlines another rapper was slayed, this is star wars"
"peace to the five percenters, online engine inventors
shout to them n****s, family men, bringin' home dinners
watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt ya happy home
miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
she not the type deserving of a throne
her beauty is her curse, she f*** for shoes and a purse
make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
i shop in barcelona, i spend some nights in rome
feel like a knight from england, that's what i named my son:
knight
he was born to be one, that's how my game was won
white 740 beamer, licked by an angel's tongue
i'm livin' dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
honey be pocket watchin', she got a lot of options
hard to make up her mind decidin' which baller to rock with
hot to death, slim pickets, but i'm not impressed
she got the hottest sex, so i guess i'mma just...
stay
even though
i don't like you, next friday night can't wait to fight you
locked up i would knife you, don't f*** with you
last month i even bucked at you, you got locked
i felt bad, wait, do i got love for you?
i might kill you, but do i got love for you?
i want you dead under 6 feet of soil
at the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
we hate each other, but it's love, what a thug mystery
years ago they ate the heart of a slain enemy
we enemies, but your hatred could never enter me
some seek fame cause they need validation
some say hatin' is confused admiration
spotlight on me, i still look twenty
still get money, lady killer pushin' a bentley
maybe n****s could see too much
of they failures through a n**** who realer
i don't like you near bruh, but i need you to...
stay"
"uh, you know i still run with that, that blood of a slave
ballin in my veins
it's just hot until a n**** can't take it no more
blood of a slave, heart of a king
turn my voice up
aiiyo, tha brothas ""stillmatic""
i crawled up out of that grave, wiping the dirt, cleaning my shirt
they thought i'll make another ""illmatic""
but it's always forward i'm moving
never backwards stupid here's another classic
c notes is falling from the sky
by now the credits roll starring nas executive poet, produced, directed by
the kid slash escobar
narration describes the lives and laws tribes in the ghetto trying to survive
the feature opens with this young black child
finger scratch, cigarette burns on the sofa, turning the tv down
mary jane girls, 45's playing, soft in the background
poof from c town's mornings was hash browns
stepped over dope fiends, walking out the door, all of us poor
i learned the difference between the snitches, the real ones, and who's soft
and the murderous, hungriest crews
people jumping from roofs, shotguns pumping made it through my youth
walking very thin lines, ages seven and nine
that's the age i was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
i know the streets thirst water like moses
walking through the hot desert searching to be free
this is my end and my new beginning nostalgia
alpha and omega places, it's like a glitch in the matrix
i seen it at all, did it all, most of y'all been pop for a minute
spitters, sinners and the game get rid of y'all
y'all got there but y'all didn't get it all, i want my style back
hate to cease y'all plan it's the rap reaper man
to them double up hustlers, bidders, n****z who real
professionals, stick up kids dreaming for meals
let my words guide you, get inside you
from crypts to pirals this is survival
blood of a slave, heart of a king
blood of a slave, heart of a king
uh, uh blood of a slave, heart of a king
uh, yea"
"g's, yeah, yeah
qb, aq, ravenswood, woodside, let's go 
my thumb struck a lot of lighters, pulled a lot of all nighters
banned from some afterhours spots
my crew would choose violence, move in silence
who knew i'd grew to build an empire?
streets had me against the ropes, would've thought i was ziplining
tecs in the dresser, money off tech, pushing a tesla
rolled up a fresh one, it's one ipo to the next one
rich from corporate or thuggin', expensive mistakes
it's all a racket, it's the same thing, just the risk that you take
moving too fast, blues on your ass
the boys came through with the task
peep through the blinds, you knew it was curtains
breadwinner take a l, leave the whole family hurting
seen it a million times, system washed him out with the verdict
so i'm clean as a whistle, drinking premium liquor
in between two argentinian sisters
they counting up for me until their fingers get blisters
what i blew that on? i cannot seem to remember
it's not even bragging
it's okay, it's gon' be okay
flyest n**** in this rap shit
yo, as i'm looking at the new york skyline
reminiscing on night time, shootouts with my guys
pouring this white wine, you could richard millie your left wrist
keep in perspective, we on god's time what happens when dealers reduce to addicts?
what happens when kings don't see their potential status?
what's your exit plan? face to face with my omens, i never ran
stood on stages most never can, pyrotechnics and leather pants
shifting the culture
mention me with mick jagger and bono like you're 'posed to
i'm standing next to rookies, somehow they looking older
the altitude of matter so cold, it'll make your nose run
how you expect to get love if you don't show none?
i should send you little n****s on a store run
how we're moving is no cut
i'm from the era of razor blades and coke dust
people living with no trust, champagne in the soap suds
so i'm clean as a whistle, drinking premium liquor
in between two argentinian sisters
they counting up for me until their fingers get blisters
what i blew that on? i cannot seem to remember
the world is yours
scarface, tony montana shit
it's yours, yours, yours
r. i. p ecstasy from whodini
dmx, prince markie dee, shock g
real rap gods, do you know the meaning?
all the rap brothers we lost this year, and last year
ayo, check it out
run to the store for me, man
get me veggie chips, blunts and a bottle
you got this shit all twisted, man
it's about rank, you ain't there yet
think you gon' send me to the store? i own the store, man
i'm just testing you
i got the hood playing golf, wild boss style
crucifixes over the chrome hearts, you get crossed out
people battered down, asian hate getting passed around
tiger happy, both his parents' lives matter now
marble floors is my common law, we company builders
i inspired those who inspired you to run up millions
not perfect, persistent, keep it more pure than the purest
i do this for the 'jects and them good hearted jurors"

my man put me up for the share, one fourth of a square
headed for delaware wit' one change of gear
nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
wit' the glaze in my eye that we find when we crave
dollars and cents  a fugitive with two attempts
jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print

nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein' rich but now i'm all for it
my man saw it like dionne warwick
a wiser team for a wiser dream, we could all score it
the cartel, argentina coke with the nina
up in the hotel smokin' on sessamina
trina got the fishscale between her
the way the b**** shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
she got me back livin' sweeter, fresh caesar,

"uhh, still out in these motherf***in projects
still a n**** ain't never gonna get the f*** up outta here
n****z just don't understand the story
n****z die for the street glory
go to trial get tried for each story
and each n**** got a story
and qb the streets call me
so if you see me slippin' reach for me
i'm goin' after street glory
go to trial get tried for each story
and each n**** got a story
and qb the streets call me
so if you see me slippin' reach for me
i'm goin' after street glory
yo,
every time i turn around n****z shot, n****z stabbed
when tonight's pregnant girls strugling to get a cab
fiends lurkin', d's searchin' pat pockets
kids put to bed duck they heads from gas poppin'
queensbridge slingin' hoppin' our benches
don status, throw feeds, got sirenges
poppin' out they arm scratched
now remember parked cuz' else perfect ways, shell adidas
smellin' reefer way before purple haze
private stock peer n**** with ill walks like mark clare
has tilted wild n****z lickin' shots in the air
me and pop was there through the years our names have switched
ain't nothin' changed but the names nastradamus and blitz
what project is this? qb burnin' in tint
12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
what could you tell me? n****s seen it all in this game
when it's all said and done just remember our name
i'm familiar with the dead grass drama black gates and crime
embryo of the ghetto born face and time
n****s shatter they dreams while i'm chasing mine
ghetto fame got a fellow's name draped and shined
how do i describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?
where corruptors and new police being recruited
somehow i make it through the day stayin' secluded
while the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed
many thought's cause i see the past grimmly
that could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street
through all the pap grease and street chases
sudden raids and confrontations leadin the misdeamenor weed cases
i blew smoke through hallway window
watched the buddah clouds lingo
pluckin the blunt brokes from my fingers
my eyes flip different shades
similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways
seein' nothing but another day
in this six story rat trap
them gats clap another n****'s blazed
events in my hood rotate
like the battle on the 38 snob in the world of fake love
before i blaze son, i'm kissing the slugs
coming at you kisses and hugs
when death calls who's really a thug
the street glory got me deeply in love
can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it
got me needin' this drug"
"yeah, yeah, yeah
you was born in the eighties, pops drove a mercedes
did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
look around it might hit you
no joke, i wanna pistol fight with you
shit comes around faster than you think
blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
become a creature of habitat, the average cat
won't see where it's at, or where it's going
the hood waits for no one
i've been through it from ewings to buicks, to body viewings
car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
from wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
imagination is what they lack
it stops n****z from getting stacks
feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks
wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple
""from the day you were born"" ""starring out, a young disciple"" ""you had that gleam in your eye"" disciple of the projects!
""from the day you were born"" ""street's disciple"" ""disciple of the projects"" 
moonstruck stuck, slow as molasses in my actions
that's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life
in my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin tyson
after watchin him cut up razor ruddock
in the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
lookin back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
older gods wantin no static, told some lil' n****z they can have it
coke baggin and toe taggin
they took will, let me describe him, a live one
i think that he was the true +god's son+   not jesus, but fearless
his ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin
not to his likin, and say 'son they bitin you""
he never got to see my debut, wild mannered
but wild with them hammers, n****z frontin couldn't stand it
took him off the planet, left us in 9 2
with the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple
plug the mics up, i'm ready to rock, knocking
reminiscing of measuring pots of pyrex, cook in the kitchen
captain hook to these infants
it's like my folks is still on the benches
surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
rhyming to music all this time
fighting 'bout how kane and rakim would do it
seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
from the block, where the world was forever freezing
hell if i ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
f*** these devil policemen, plush leathers, i need them
risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
f*** a sermon from the neighborhood pope
he's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
multi colored pelle pelle's, young stretch mark bellies
babies born in a cycle, future disciples"
"ay fellas
i think you might wanna s s sneak your ratchet in here for this one
ay ladies
put your petroleum jelly on your face
yo nas, we got a big bet in the streets
that you knock they ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
get 'em!
sittin up drunk, shufflin thoughts
got paper but i'm lost
losin focus what a n**** still hustlin for
my seed is straight, the fam is settled
idle time get the man in trouble
when wifey tourin, my life get boring
start to remember all types of torment
the devil's callin, but i don't answer
mom passed from cancer, leavin behind
two granddaughters, two grandsons, two 9's
next to me in the phantom, who lyin?
big screen documentaries of idi amin
gotta, try to stay away from creeps
with they bullshit, tryin to put me back in the streets
war stories, funerals
where feds be layin from a dreadful slayin
body viewing's at the wake
n**** sit stiff in his ferrari, no casket
with his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
iceman watch on, the suit gucci
i'm above the standard
but dude just mar salis than branford
thinkin you're too rich, they wanna gun ya
kidnap ya cause of they hunger, but you f***in with hunters
camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips

mean muggin your b****, cause she leans over
to look closer told you y'all sloppy gangsters sayin
""nas is this and nas is that""
your eyes go front, your eyes go back
surprised i'm at the same place y'all be at
it's obvious you don't know how i react
like, i don't know where the party's at
you're foamin at the mouth, losin breath
like a cardiac arrest, but i ain't impressed
cause the fact is, y'all don't really want it
two to the head, fo' to the stomach
call more security cause i come off
anywhere you at you scary cats
if you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
a thousand times harder than when i first came
y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
and y'all just forgot about the consequences
not a jail sentence, but see
the n**** you feed'll kick it to dude that kick it to me
we posess, the recipes for death, cause jealousy destroys
feed the dog first, watch out for salmonella poisoning
i know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
and say, ""that's the way you kill a man, avoid the shooting""
hey...
you smile, in my face
secretly i know, you want my place
you waitin on me to choke, don't want a n**** to breathe
you wanna come cut my throat, you wanna get rid of me
but before i let it happen them guns gon' start clappin
and y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe

crack money was ""ghetto heaven""
n****z gettin' it
every block rise to perfection
green tops, boulders and bottles
soldiers who follow leaders
you owed 'em dollars
know that tommorrow you might not see it
packs got knocked off by sprinklers that never worked
all the way to the monkey bars, cross that line you got murked
that's other n****z territory had fiends in the cheese line
they told them fiends calm down, ten dollars each dime
they never scared of po po, was only one patrol car
they wasn't up for crack and i was up on the chin of pa
watching hustlers with tinted cars, money makin'
but one kid was into takin'
had dreadlocks wasn't jamaican
fort green he laid
first n**** i ever saw rockin' dreads with a fade
lead he sprayed on the corners in my hood
dodgin' and runnin'
the glare in his eyes told you somethin' was commin'
they went to war, godbless rita, got shot by mistake
n****z got knocked by them jakes
homicide suit and tie cops, mayor koch, screams in rage

a puff of weed, nothing but greed don't live by the rules
f***in' wit' me here's what i do
try to sell your freedom i'm accustomed to
you could ball wit' me or get arrested too
it's easy to land where they dwell with the greasy hands
twenty to l' what's your plan take your grams
you bought you a lexus, bbs spendin' abrahams
never learned your lesson, choose the right direction
thin line from life and death and my man checked in
a motel, same one as a young g he know well
crossed 'em on a coke sell then went on a run
but shorty got his old folks killed, yo he got 'em done
nobody to run to, what succumb to
my n**** just wanted to eat, now he hunted on the street

though it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should
little gotti got down for his, let off seven rounds
the kid he hit is heaven bound if he's on the good list
shorty who shot 'em ran knowing n****z would snitch
five years passed he ain't been in the hood since
shot this n**** over a hundred dollars, money, had borrowed
time passed, on his birthday he couldn't afford a bottle
least expected to see 'em, then he asked for his
n**** said he don't got it, so he blast the kid
escapes the scene, but he couldn't escape the dream
or how the kid fell when bullets made it too late to scream
seeing money's face starin' at him
in black space feelin' hands touchin' him
wake up it got too much for him
once liked to be alone
until he started hearin' groans and seein' things
now it's time to go home
n****z shocked to see him
gave him respect what he was missin'
all the way from va his aunt yell ""he hate to listen""
so he popped up, they gave him hugs, showed him love
then he was reminded of that night when he sprayed all them slugs
he hangin' like nuttin' happened, police grabbed him up
now he seein' ghosts in the cell, they got him strapped up
psycho ward, rest of his life injected thorazine
haunted memories in his mind of the murder scene

leave her standing at the altar, bro, i couldn't falter
plus that nigerian blood mixed in her culture

ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
flowers and flames, flutes from her fingers
rifles pointed from her sac

either way, she wore a compass on her head
rains don't stop the grass from turnin red

arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life

symbol of the drama yet to come   too late to run

his right leg drabbed with demon paste
shoes stayed angel laced

even a prophet can catch a case
didn't realize how sweet the future might taste

words were weapons against their hate
shepherds search for stars in her hair
her chest grew fermented like yeast
she broke her body like aged bread
he gave her truth from all the books he'd read
she wrote her poems inside the mud
sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
named their boys and spit truth inside his mouth
read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
resurrected from bones and dirt
she made hard n****z smile
left her seeds inside the earth
gave hustlers and killers life's worth

he jumped out a jeep, heard her tell him, ""don't grab boo""
they started chattin, was only bout a minute, flat when

cause our click is thick
another day another dollar
more money, more murder"
"can't bury you with your money
can't bury you with your b****
born alone, die alone
yeah, yeah
yeah, burn the whole place down
no more foul plays, housing mentality, shoot 'em down days
going out of town with a couple of pound plays
always the one you call your friend but then his style changed
hard time for non violent crimes, that's a outrage
we need a meeting, money and fame is fleeting
you never really know the reason why two people is beefing
bloody murder, in the '80s, he had suede louis seats in the 'burban
did dirty, his sentеnce start turning
look at life, took advice from thе streets of vernon
nothing nice, john boy ice, his death undetermined
pick an island, anywhere for your happy soul or return it
when i'm gone, i pray my family don't get the cash and burn it
to the floor, black 4's laced up
galactica glaciers, eighty eight karats, immaculate paystubs
them n****s do a crime, i drop a rhyme, it's the same rush
and they been sending shots a n**** way but they ain't struck
can't f*** with me
i been outside since a buck fifty was the only way to get your face done
doggystyle cd, turn that ""murder was the case"" up
thinking when i drop my first shit, i'm leaving they face scrunched
black from the dark side of vernon from the dime block
they had it clicking but today, it's the new slimes out
instagram trickin' the hood, what they crying 'bout?
petty crimes, b****es and money, that's why they lying 'bout
n****s ain't telling the truth enough y'all don't look like the truth to us
hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah
n****s ain't telling the truth enough y'all don't look like the truth to us
hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah
now you got your marching orders
this shit'll make your mouth water like food grill with wood chips
woolriche, button up flannel, looking wolfish
my hair wolfing, central bookings, simple lessons
one foot on the curb, one foot in the lexus, my style is eclectic
eat you pussies for breakfast, then i offer refreshments
look all that fly shit y'all harping on
they take a watch from your arm and cops do nothing about it
that's what's going on, many changes, more races
when i was touring the nation with warrants on probation
i was a small kid amazed with the thought
one day i'd be banking, iv from drinking
papi to abu dhabi, probably parley with saudis
crank the engine on the '74 chevy chevelle
shawty friend is a snake, i told her her bestie ain't real
you gotta watch that, as the lobster crack, i spray the baccarat
your reputation, you can't clean that shit up at no laundromat
sucker, see somebody has to say it, the boy still ain't graduated
i must say they cap the greatest my team is mature, the bags are secured
surrounded by addicts addicted to having more
n****s ain't telling the truth enough y'all don't look like the truth to us
hype off that lil' dirt you did, that ain't shit to the kid, woah
n****s ain't telling the truth enough y'all don't look like the truth to us

philosophical gangsta, where violent priors

leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires
flash iron, or anybody tryin on the blocks i'm supplyin on
mighty call, my peeps, tie ballons up
and swallow 'em and the penal got goons, lots of 'em
cops see them and run, don't want no drama
certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
mortar, hood haunted like the dakota
where john lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
he begged for freedom, hanged wit wild jamaicans
from kingston, who drink irish moss
listenin to peter winston, machintosh
lightning hits the top of the church steeple
when i'm writin, semi automatic no hyphen
it's frightening....

i take summers off, cause i love winter beef
started '87, wit the shotty in the sheet
three quarter length beige, dressed to kill
bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
rule which car heart, gun powder stains
smellin like trees, set some mill on the brain
skeemin on ya girls, bamboozled on ya chain
got ill up on the train, twistin off a cap
of a english in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
cause you bought a drummer soap, from one of my boys, it's
.... just another day in the hood
and i'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
we saw the movies, like tony montana, and 'em
but our style was let them piled in, we robbin 'em

check, one, two one, two
check, one, two

"i want you to close your eyes
and vision the most beautiful place in the world
if you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
come on this journey
the best journey
thugz mansion
acres of land and swimming pools and all that
check it out
i'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
to fly like ddoves over the streets watchin' many things
kids walkin' home from school on drug blocks, missionaries
pass out papers that read: love god
i see faces, cases, judges, juries, masons, lawyers and cops
i watch because every thugs face is my mirror
but this was one in particular
this kid he was the vintage stick em up pro
16 years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
every mornin calls his comrad to come and get him to smoke
he insane, already gone mad
blames himself for his setbacks
dangerous street corners where his sets at
sling from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
chasin' him, his ass was flarin'
smokin' like a chimney, on remy, of course he not carin'
he need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
i give him a helpin' hand and, bring him out to thugz mansion
every corner, every city
there's a place where life's a little easy
little hennessy, laid back and cool
every hour, cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright
nothin but peace, love
and street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion
dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
tell the homies i'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
seen a show with marvin g**e last night, it had me shook
drippin peppermint schnapps, with jackie wilson, and sam cooke
then some lady named billie holiday
sang sittin there kickin it with malcolm, 'til the day came
little latasha sho' grown
tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
maybe in time you'll understand only god can save us
when miles davis cuttin lose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
picture a place that they exist, together
there has to be a place better than this, in heaven
so right before i sleep, dear god, what i'm askin
remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion
a place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by
no policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
no reason, for nobody's momma to cry
see i'm a good guy, i'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
but if i should die, i know all of my albums support her
this whole year's been crazy, asked the holy spirit to save me
only difference from me and ossie davis, gray hair maybe
cause i feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin
i'm just twenty some odd years, i done lost my mother
and i cried tears of joy, i know she smiles on her boy
i dream of you more, my love goes to afeni shakur
cause like ann jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
and just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavnly champagne
what angels saw, with golden wings in thug's mansion"
"yo, my man was regulatin on n****s he used to thug with
older n****s in this murder game, drug czars
bm, jaguars, they cash was large
since he was wild, they let him in
he did a crazy number of things
to put himself deeper under they wing
it didn't take long for duke to get on
studied they movements   who would kill, who was strong
studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin
drivin they cars, robbin connects
drivin his lex, keys was movin
young don, now they know they weakness
they never seen it comin
son was on some real take over the streets hit
now he got his own crew of young guns clickin now
richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?
dudes be, comin from bids thinkin shit is different
cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
i just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
real relaxed, readin real loves stories like
ceaser and cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
cause liz taylor's hot, but the egyptian queen
on the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
baby powder, night owl, movin to later hours, only
f***in with kings, n****s official
if you phony, come in the circle, n****s'll diss you
we converse on the state of hip hop
we share the same views and feelings
he sling cain, crib costin 2 million
he plan to leave the streets forever
but n****s that wanted him left him"
"i told her, i'd hold her
all through that first cold winter
defend her, protect her
from our darkest demons
then spring came, our world changed
we found a different corner
still heading, still searching
for what we had that season
i thought i was so strong, a man on a blue mountain
the sword in my hand, but my thoughts in the clouds then
see them
hear them
i would never change another day
if that season was the one to stay
i swear i'd never change another day
ten years now, i've waited
for that coldest winter
no whiter, no wiser
and all we hear is thunder
i thought i was so strong, a father on a mountain
the sword in my hand, but my thoughts in the clouds then
see them
hear them
i would never change another day
if that season was the one to stay
i swear i'd never change another day
ten years now, i've waited
for that coldest winter
no wiser, no whiter
oh how i miss that season"
"chorus 
said it aint to much for me

"i see your true colours shinin' through,
i see your true colours and thats why i love you
i see your true colours shinin' through,
i see your true colours and thats why i love you baby
fall or forgive we all tryna survive when we live,
i'd rather feed the homeless they've time to talk to their kids,
sure life aint the walk on the bridge,
dam its hard as it is when i be dreaming i be talking to big,
in my 'hood it aint a yellow brick road
we had a shot seko sneakers hanging from a telephone pole,
and my daddy aint no rainbow or pots of gold,
but there was love from the family when times were cold,
i sit and analyse the world from my project roof,
and seen the hope in the eyes of a troubled youth,
a good kid well kept the burning in this mother goose,
a motherless child in these streets loose,
and the more the words are raged these are rainy days,
my man got popped at an early age,
his collage friends say he flipped him to his early grave,
they say the good the young were having fun at the pearly gates.
i see your true colours shinin' through, i see your true colours and thats why i love you i see your true colours shinin' through, i see your true colours and thats why i love you
this aint that strong was it meant to be?
2 people from 2 different words it wasnt meant to be,
it must have been fate you were sent to me,
we'll make it through these hard times eventually,
to stand and fight,
war by faith and not by sight,
we're all the same colour when you turn out the lights,
take the sunshine with the pain,
grandma sarah got sad thats with the range,
no fridge"
"it's like a cold story repeated over and over
in the winters of my mind
this shit be real man
shit's crazy out here
yo yo, yo what up y'all
that's my n****s over there
word
if you scared to take chances
you'll never have the answers
i could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
is he gonna cock it and pop it
his waistband big
but he don't have that thing in him
slanging just ain't in him
body language is off, he's soft
but soft n****s all a sudden start dumping, fronting
cause he feel a way
my n****s say the eyes is a giveaway
one look could tell me if you really came to kill me
be the quiet n**** looking
laying with the milli
who that over there, creeping
who homie by the tree
better safe than sorry, look at p noid me
few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
be a cold day in hell fore they creep on me
it's a lesson every premonition
lotta n****s killed 'cause they wasn't paying attention
listen
i want a b**** i can trust
some n****s i can trust
accountants looking over my figures i can trust
a lawyer that's fighting for my decisions i can trust
damn my n**** trust
i can never get enough
a ruger i can trust
shooters i can trust
goons that know how to spot out a judas i can trust
and if i can't trust you, the f*** is you here for
some of you n****s' true colors becoming clear more
it's been so long
can't remember how we begun this war
this is a ever lasting thunderstorm
cause guns went off
i see your mom's she still speak
she don't know i ain't cool with her son no more
it's old shit, see forever we holding this grudge
takes real men to squash beef
end it with hugs
we buried our dead, been years
why should i worry bout him
constantly watching my back
plus n****s telling i dread
another day i put a family in black
though i be calm and relaxed
though i know somehow it will come back
even if i'm in the right
cause still a life is a life
what was it worth to see you covered in dirt
it's quite redundant
whether you the hunter or the hunted
mother's cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
just tattoos of my n****s' names
i wonder will it change
let's ride
it's rare i listen to n****s who never been in my position
a caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
from the mind of a man who went at it with killers
sit down little man
let me school you in hood business
seen a lotta n****s blow
lotta dreams folded
some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
ain't too much left to buy
bought it i'm loaded i guess
lear jets
i ask myself do i need love or success
they say the artist that truly suffers
his stuff is the best
cause his heart bleed on his sleeve
pain pistols and sex
remember spray painting the word fresh and then staring at it
older folks angry, pointing, swearing at it
buildings i sprayed, nowadays drive the mclaren past it
same old man from years ago told me life is short
so from infant to geriatric
trust your own judgment
live with it and love it"
"real conversation for that ass
 huh
 what you said, can't hear you man
 speak the f*** up
 word 
nastradumas, astrologic, know when i rep
flow when i'm set, got the chips to a lotus my whip
gold on my neck was once a code of respect
for high rollers and vets
now its loads of baguettes, prefer a mack 10 over a tech
no matter sober or wet, i smack soldiers, cadets
trees that might eject my hype back
famous phrase ""n**** light that""
hoes you f***, ask you where your ice at, dun
its all about playboys, when we was young
can only get tongue, then finally we can cum
busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
from bottles, to seven in your hand
to fake pepsi's to get to the crack, unscrew the can
gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
we got it if the fiends want it
the whole block singing the same theme ""don it""
f*** it, too many crabs in the bucket
if its ice work, i'm gonna truck it
you gotta love it, you gotta love it
 f*** it
 you gotta love it
 f*** it
 you gotta love it
 f*** it
 you gotta love it
  
some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
get pulsive with malice insentitives, the foulest of b****es
hung up my riches, her childest wishes
be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
kicking this flow, slip in a new fo'
so when your click roll, i let my clips go, n****s on opposite polls
i got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
inhuman, living hostile opposed
to living on the streets, proper from my top to my toes
aeropostale my clothes, vernon n****s in suburbans with liquor
preposterous foes, frantically foul n****s
see n****s in blast, there goes a loud difference
coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
you can't be a kingpin when you snitching
regardless, we still make you a target
we shoot you and chill, chrome objects
hit you in your projects, its street anomics
this rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
miserable cats, hunger painting
get off your ass, stop complaining
my crew be in montego bay margariting
while you home, waiting your arraignment
this thug life you claimed it, i make millions from entertainment
now back in the hood, certain cats they wanna kill me
they ice grill me, but on the low, n****s feel me
you gotta love it, you gotta love it
 f*** it
 you gotta love it
 f*** it
 you gotta love it
  "
"uhh, oooooooooooooh baby, baby
keep it thug, and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah
now slowly, thinkin of all the things that oppose me
i think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
for they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
dead in the street, it's so f***in pitiful
first they love you, could be the b**** that even live with you mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
cause she wanna dress like bonnie, robin and crystal do
but crystal's single, bonnie's broke and her n****z too i can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth

"intro: the unauthorized copy. dedication to my children, my child
destiny jones. to my niece and nephews, suree, malik, jabari.
the world is yours. acknowledgements: first off, i wanna
thank god. and i wanna thank everybody for helping me out
with this. couldn't do it without you. chapter 1.
january 28, 1968
born into this world as william griffin the great
chapter 1, wyndanch long island
scientific rhymin' invented a new sound when he met with
eric barrier from east sandhurst
the melody they created was the first
burst on the scene, 1986 with clap to this
'87 dropped a classic disc
the facts is the tracklist was like four
the vocals, the beats    according to marly marl
recorded in my hometown queensbridge
that's why it's so relative
this biography was unauthorized
i spit it how it was given to author nas
william changed his name at sixteen to rakim allah
'cause clarence 13x had new york on lock
gods on every block, jams in every park
i remember hearin' curtis blow saying
it can't get better than this
'til run dmc blew my brains to bits
from leather coats to shell toes to the stan smiths, to dapper dan kicks
first million dollar deal ever in rap, 18th letter did that
from 41st broadway to uni to mca
we followed the leader to harlem's apollo theatre
supreme rapped and the 50 that don't rap
forte green, queens, long island wolfpack
paid in full posse, hot they was on
and ra had his firstborn
with the next line i'ma be easy
his wisdom's name is fifi
epmd put a record out, was dope
tension spread, and i smack me and i smack you back
sounded like the answer to the i ain't no joke track
for a second it ain't look good
little tension buzzin' from wyndanch to brentwood
misunderstood, all forgot by sixteen when i met freddy foxx
totin' burners, the whole coast's most concern was
how was rakim's flow, made christians convert with islamic ways
let the rhythm hit 'em was the third lp
a sophisticated mean one, before similar voices were king son
a few others, but sooner or later, the game was ra's kingdom
at sixteen, son was watchin' him, mesmorized
respect, not jockin' him, was so amazin', besides
he came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
walk with me now
unauthorized biography of rakim. epilogue: mother was
a jazz singer. nephew to r & b legend ruth brown
discography: paid in full, follow the leader, let
the rhythm hit 'em, don't sweat the technique. that's
the end of the group. went off to solo. dropped the r, then the 18th letter, and i think, somethin', the
master. was signed to aftermath, scheduled to release
an album with my guy dr. dre. the album was
dismantled because of creative differences. thee end
to the new beginning. yeah. next book, krs one. peace."

"uh..
pacino life, g a roll, casino dice
at the mirage, vegas strip, neon lights
gamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars
flashin cameras, dealers, shufflin cards
spent the weekend, already miss new york and it's odd
cause i'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
i never hang out, when we do we bust the four five
cause shells comin back at us while we jump in the ride
flyin, duckin, our b****es in the club cluckin
tellin my wife who i was dancin with like i was f***in
flew back, monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin
to the concrete jungle of cement
limousine's from laguardia airport, sleepin
told my dogs peace, kept in movin, i was beat when
got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
ringin the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
slow music, h town, no that's down low
my baby's, drop mercedes is parked, i creep around yo
to the back, she must be inside and can't hear
probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin her hair
i walked in through the back door entrance
shocked it was unlocked, when i walked in, i smelled incense
chased by a weed aroma, empty guinnesses
and lipstick marks on like three empty coronas
a pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 timberlands
somethin swingin on the ceilin fan, i stopped it
swingin slower and slower..
on the last swing i saw it was a g string and heard laughin
thought about my nine side glock but somethin made me disregard it
started my way up to where the noise and music was at
froze, i couldn't react
bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin with some n****
mumblin shit, he had one hand on her ass
and she was rubbin his d***, toastin wine glasses
cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
searchin for words i found none, without a sound
i left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
now i'm out buggin, whylin, what i'm gon do?
call my man horse, meet me outside, i'm comin through
i thought you loved me
i thought you cared for me
i thought you needed me
did you believe in me? * repeat 2x *
got up with horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
i ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
""son you home early    they wiped you out that quick?""
i said, ""nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
to the grand central, from the van wyck expressway
i said, ""bet you'll never guess in a million years
what i just saw happenin    and probably still is
snuck in my crib   some n**** f***in my wiz
i saw dem, they ain't see me, i ducked and i slid
i'ma grab shorty, i need you to grab the n**** for me""
just when i thought i found love, she shitted on me
shopped in vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 g's on a ring i would have hit her today with
my surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
we pulled up, he was walkin out the house backwardly
parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
walked to the front when i talked he had junk
b**** tried to slam the door shut, got caught in horse foot
shot the spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
one between the eye, she's died, by mistake
must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
heard somebody knock    horse helped me hide the bodies
heard si rens, i guess we goin out we out like kamikazes
we surrounded, red lights flashin, who's inside?
came out a bullhorn, i'm contemplatin suicide
horse asked me for the mac, he gave me dap, one love
cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
mad shots couldn't tell what was goin on
sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
pulled her ring out my pocket i was savin
put it on her ring finger cocked the glock, and started prayin
to muhammad and allah, the most beneficial
through you, all things are possible, i know you're listenin
i never meant for this to happen, i never dreamed
this'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
on that note, same time, the cops busted in
kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, i said ""amen""
put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
squeeze the toast, said to her, ""now unto god, we elope""
.. we elope .."
"""they did not have the power to stop louis farrakhan
they were trying to touch on and thieve envy within the leadership
but as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline
his presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life

no revolutionary gets old or so i'm told
your left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
i heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name
i ain't see 'em take aim, i dreamt this day came
'cause i stood in the face of damnation
satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
he want my blood, why me?
why not the fake who deserve death man?
f*** it, i'll take one
'cause stop me but can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
they believe in reparation makes it even
so i'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
in budapest, japan, china, and switzerland
we getting it in son, another bullet pass by, miss me
wondering who plotting to get me?
alphabet boys still plotting against me
to hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
you won't remember why they came to clip me
when time go by you'll soon forget me
they say he was the king of bling, jewels, and bentley's
then i use one of my lines just to prove i'm guilty
don't let' em kill me...
""they did not have the power to stop louis farrakhan.""
""they did not have the power to stop louis farrakhan.""
""they did not have the power to stop louis farrakhan.""
""they did not have the power to stop louis farrakhan.""

it was a night like this forty million years ago
i lit a cigarette, picked up a monkey skull to go
the sun was spitting fire, the sky was blue as ice
i felt a little tired, so i watched miami vice
and walked the dinosaur, i walked the dinosaur
chorus:
open the door, get on the floor
everybody walk the dinosaur
open the door, get on the floor
everybody walk the dinosaur
open the door, get on the floor
everybody walk the dinosaur
open the door, get on the floor
everybody walk the dinosaur
i met you in a cave, you were painting buffalo
i said i'd be your slave, follow wherever you go
that night we split a rattlesnake and danced beneath the stars
you fell asleep, i stayed awake and watched the passing cars
and walked the dinosaur, i walked the dinosaur
chorus
one night i dreamed of new york
you and i roasting blue pork
in the statue of liberty's torch
elvis landed in a rocket ship
healed a couple of leapers and disappeared
but where was his beard?????
a shadow from the sky much too big to be a bird
a screaming crashing noise louder than i've ever heard
it looked like two big silver trees that somehow learned to soar
suddenly a summer breeze and a mighty lion's roar
i killed the dinosaur, i killed the dinosaur
chorus 2:
open the door, get on the floor
everybody kill the dinosaur
open the door, get on the floor
everybody kill the dinosaur
open the door, get on the floor
everybody kill the dinosaur
open the door, get on the floor
everybody kill the dinosaur
repeat chorus 2 one time
boom boom ac"
"verse one:
yo, the lord is my shepard
the sword is my weapon
reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle
shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another mother loses a son
'cause where i'm from the young chooses a gun
before they choose an education
but once dead their ain't no awakenin'
so like once said, life aint for fakin
yo, you wit' me when i say duct tape 'em?
f*** waitin'
got the truck outside, benz jeep for navigation
everything in position, they'd rather be f***in' wit' satan
when i aim i aint missin', master of assasination'
i heard he call himself esco, drive a lexo
rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves with a chipped tooth
is this the truth?
this is what we do, sip a brew
wait around his crib until it turns around two am
as soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em
you guys got fat while i was away, so start payin'
chorus   okay, you wanna play rough?!
  repeat 3x,
okay yo, we could play rough!
verse two:
okay now, drive up to my crib, am i high enough?
who these n****s tryin' to hide in their truck
i aint order cable, why in the f*** these n****s
ducked in they seat? are they lookin' for me?
but i aint do shit, could it be that n****s thought
i slept like b.i.g. and pac did
may they rest in peace, but while i'm alive i pop shit
p 11 glock spits 17 shot clips
put these n****s in boxes, where they moms and pops is
pull the strap from under the seat
back up in the street
watch these n****s thats tryin' to watch me, i carefully creep
take off my shoes, barefoot n**** poppin' my heat
empty every shell in their direction
its you, i should've guessed it!
same n****s that i was connected wit', i know sent you
now i'm'a take you off here, you dont know what you got into
chorus
verse three:
walked in his house, smackin' him up, ""what you talkin' about?"" he said
shut up n****! knocked him in his head with chrome
never thought i'd be in his home
with his wife taped up for my n****s to bone
f***in' with me, you should've known
i'll have 'em write ""stupid n****"" on your tombstone
what money can do, get you hit for less than a g
for threatenin' me
i'm'a do it myself, take you to hell, this ones for free
killin' you n****s with nothin'
left him dead, engine runnin'
you the only i'm makin' sure that gets whats comin'
look at your woman, anal ripped out, its your fault
they gang banged your b**** out in your face and you saw it
but before i let you have it i'm searchin' your crib
for pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live
shit like that, incase a n**** wanna strike back
i'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the mac
n****s treat you like fam, and you on it like that?
now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats
gettin' even's never wrong, its only right to react
eye for an eye, 'cause the sweetest part is payback
somebody kncokin', who dat?
""a cop man"", let him in
and give that mothaf***a one under the chin
cant believe this n**** down with the feds!
the copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead
dont explain, i put the pound on his head
blew 'em! before that i cant remember the last time i said......
okay, so we gonna play rough!"
"there's a war in the streets tonight
and nobody's really feelin' alright
i got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
i know now that i'm feelin' right if it goes down
'cause my third eye sees the lowdown
and i know it's not my time to go now
'cause god's got my back in this showdown
so i know we'll be alright
yeah, brooks brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth is holdin' those
briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks
silver fo' fo', got no,
my chauffer driver just left some of my colleagues smokin' that cali
caught a glimpse of myself in the barney's shop window
kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little
got an office on broadway, business in jamaica
tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her
and i'm late to a dite with my wife, i realize
i stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
and i'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me
but god got me, no fear, through the fire pride stop
there's a war in the streets tonight
and all this drama's got me feelin' uptight
i don't know what i'll do if i don't see my boo
'cause she's standin' on the corner of linden boulevard
holding our baby in her baby in her arms
so hold on, your daddy's in sight
yeah, nine four, destiny opens her eyes
for the first time, praise god, baby mom's cryin'
planned to be a strong black family
but we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin'
new come, i caught verbal assassin runnin' with
nothin' but the worst type, worst fight
but we brought my baby home the first night
cursed like sailors, burst out the crib
ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment
champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash
did this b**** just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
i'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not desi
moved back to your grandma, i'm single, the land's mine
she keeps the benz, i'm all in the streets again
squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers,
hard bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
new woman, she's great, this a different world,
checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
it's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy
i've grown up the thankful for lessons god gave me
there's a war in the streets tonight
and nobody's really feelin' alright
i got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
i know now that i'm feelin' right if it goes down
'cause my third eye sees the lowdown
and i know it's not my time to go now
'cause god's got my back in this showdown
so i know we'll be alright"

right through a man's soul
straight through his eyes, straight through his heart i'm still alive how did i
make it this far
'cause i been high i been low, searchin' for a way to go
every single night i pray
and lord i'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
i guess it's just a warrior's way
this is the song, of my warriors
a warrior song bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
definition of a warrior
gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum
like king nasir fightin' the
british regime i can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost in
their world

god that you ever have kid i'm askin, what would you do at your own mom's
funeral

i can't keep still i can't go on, responsible for so many
her last days at the hospital
visits from family i'm tryin' not to bust shots at n****s
wishin' death on other n****'s mothers ain't right but why mommy
she raised me in the projects alone
her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
got me ready to embody somethin' quickly
can't be happy, f*** a party she can't party with me
so your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
to the kids with no parents at home, grab a whole
this is the song, of my warriors
a warrior song
bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
gonna keep punchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum
fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples i die see
when you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
i think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful if you was me
all this pain i'm feelin would bend and killed you

napoleon, sun tzu, genghis khan
hitler, edi amin, i'm the tale of the hunt
let's bring back to the cat that invented the gun
from the indians all the way to the pentagon
i'm sittin on capitol hill

"still somehow i believe, we always survive.. but why?
to my dogs.. wherever you are
whattup big? you know shit is rough after you slid
you in god's hands now, keep a place for me kid
ain't nuttin changed    still _party and bullshit_
we used to +f*** r&b b****es+ and see who rhyme sickest
for every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
_machine gun funk_, from queens i came through to smoke blunts
you came to my hood, we was broke
i wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
still on the block around fiends numb from coke, i guess so
cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
but f*** it black, you livin your life, though your loved ones
peace to your daughter and your newborn son
it used to be fun, makin records to see your response
but, now competition is none, now that you're gone
and these n****z is wrong    usin your name in vain
and they claim to be new york's king? it ain't about that
it's more serious, i plan to toast it up with you
joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
ain't too many real ones out there; i feel some
but doubt they're, capable, to take it where you took it to
i missed your wake not cause i'm fake
cause i hate to see somebody so great in that way
i woulda stayed so long with so much to say
i had to put it in writin to keep me and brooklyn from fightin
tellin me to pay my respects and move to the side
but i probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
you can't kill nothin that's _ready to die_
you was like god to us in the form of allah
still somehow i believe, we always survive.. but why?
still, we, will survive
no matter what, my people just stay alive
still, we, will survive
no matter what, my people just stay alive
thug life never die..
dear 'pac, every thug sheds a tear drop    and use teeth
to bite off beer tops, and _pour out a lil' liquor_
you was more than just the wildest n****
+2pacalypse+, i understand your style n****
it's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
on the east and west coast the same shit is goin on
the industry be talkin, offendin me often
they don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
i can relate, shootouts and court dates
+all eyez on you+, n****z in your face invadin your space
you asked if i could trade in your place, how would i hold up?
how long would i ride, before i fold up?
how did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
you predicted it in every line, all in your flow
there could _never be peace_ i have to quote
can't believe i heard my name on ""the realest shit you ever wrote""
we had words cause the best supposed to clash at the top
but kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
in nyc, at mtv, people watched
we was both deep, after you left, i got no sleep
think about how us real n****z would be
if we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
you was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
like the son of god, when lucifer lied
and make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
but thug life'll never die, we stay high and just link
will there ever be another mc as nice?
will you return to us like the resurrection of christ?
still somehow i believe, we always survive.. but why?
still, we, will survive
no matter what, my people just stay alive
still, we, will survive
no matter what, my people just stay alive
i wonder what the commodores went through on tour?
did smokey robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
what has al green seen, that made him religious?
was it the drugs    put an end to the music business?
if so, should i put out the indo right now and write down
a plan and pursue my dream turn my life around
cause i'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
i'll need a extra uzi riding through my own hood in queens
it be the ones you always knew, that want it on
tellin everybody it was him, that you fronted on
thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
not used to walkin in the path of legit money
i thought i made it but we only took baby steps
up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
to my clicks when i got it i said ""baby bless""
that was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
we in the 90's, and finally it's lookin good
hip hop took it to billions, i knew we would
a lot of ups and downs in the game, could lose or gain
a couple pounds tryin to maintain    one day you here
the next you not; when you around n****z, check 'em out
some is bout it, most individuals plots
and run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
while others have no cares and stay in jail
more than fifty percent of us
endin up with holes through the chest
through the head, through the gut it shows
the future for us young shooters and old killers
who become rich as dope dealers?
nothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
thug coaches with subs sittin on the bench; either that or rap
we want the fast way outta this trap
whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin crack
to my deceased gods wishin i could bring you back
but life is a dream and y'all taught me that
.. always survive.. but why?
always survive, always
still, we, will survive
no matter what, my people just stay alive
still, we, will survive
no matter what, my people just stay alive
still, we, will survive still, we, will survive still, we, will survive"

evidence remains in debate
documents of our own air force base
additional terrestrial information
other planets with life population
my observation
scientists study pictures of a flying disc
right on earth, anthropologists are finding shit
visitors, probably live with us
they can mimic us
it's sort of what we seeing in the cinemas
take a look in the mirror
and see the bigger picture
its good to be alive
its good to be alive
nobody is an island
we are part of an environment
only way we gone survive
is if we harmonize
we're not alone 
reginald lewis
the black billionaire
before oprah or bob johnson
how'd he disappear?
conspiracy theories, ufo's in the air
i've seen it with my own two eyes
and i swear, like warren buffet
real money i'm just trying to touch it
the diamond encrusted shit, live illustrious
'cause we was deprived of it, suffered
now we pop to prove anything's possible
my pimp strut was invented when they whipped us
now we diddy bop just to show you that our strength's up
just when n****s about to see they cut
global warming about to burn us up
n****s never really seen paper in this world
american blacks the teenager of this world
give us twenty more years to grow up
already geniuses; what i mean is this
i used to worship a certain queens police murderer
'til i read the words of ivan van sertima
he inserted something in me
that made me feel worthier
now i spit revolution
i'm his hood interpreter
take a look in the mirror
and see the bigger picture
its good to be alive
its good to be alive
nobody is an island
we are part of an environment
only way we gone survive
is if we harmonize
we're not alone "

far through evisu jeans, lethal green

robin hood in the aston mart.

eat with my elbows top of the table
street etiquette with speech impediments

ask about nashwan, could ask about jung
ask about bravehearts, and ask where i'm from
q boro, specifically the bridge
don't ask no more question, ya know what it is
whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
my funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
financer, skull doo wrapped up
mob life, prizefights, plasma tvs or first floor
diversified all my circle
amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
numero uno, annuit to wet this
that's the language of our latin ancestors
on the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
in the rolls royce like the king of nigeria
my criteria, smoke cigars

these old heads got stories, the days they was kings
i pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
you 16, you could do 20, come home young
catch 20 years when you 40? holmes, you're done
what have we become? rap stars from trap stars
black gods to ansars to sunnis back to goonies
a 360 in the streets real grizzly
shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
student enrollment, the focus, yet hooligans roll with
toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
this ain't the truman show; it's the human show
ask the f.b.i. agent at his cubicle
chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
it's u.s.a. against the gangsta, where's the love?
love, i'll trade you love
i've traded fire with you long enough
is that all you brung? it's not love
that's f***ed up, but i saved your soul
roll that up
sometimes i sit on the bench just to watch the game
feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living i could name
who made it out rich, in his absence i do not proclaim
to not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
maybe just a typical thug n**** was my rank
'cept i had a vision above n****s, what i think
it's crazy how many brothers come where i come from
some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock up
younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
""cops'll look at you like they look at me? that's preposterous""
ain't it gangsta how your man made it? i'm humble
one gun, one crazy ass n****, that's jungle
now we having babies, cause growing up it was just us
no uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was f***ed up
but still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
even though me and jung ain't show up to your funeral
i hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
the g is in your genes, already you tuck
inherit your dad's swag, it's george jefferson's strut
stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
no matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
i'm a street corner n****, new york knicks loyalist
corona sipper, pass it out, might blow it with you
it ain't the truman show; it's the human show
ask the f.b.i. agent at his cubicle
chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
young brother go and get your paper, i got love

with a degree, a true man with passion
now you could enter the so called
""white man's society"" and go right past them
looking in the wall street journal for your face
but it's always absent
you know that's him eating foie and ambrosia
watch on his arm, golden, latin
try to get his attention
but he's flinching, guess my grimy clothes threw him off, so i mention
we were neighbors some time ago
he was kinda cold, in this restaurant
full of his kind and more
he sighed, tried to look surprised, i know
his side of the city where he resides, so
i had to go
i heard him laugh hard at some sad black jokes
hate so called ""intellectuals""
no balls, he suggests we vote
he stand all proud, speaking to correct his folks
he want to lecture folks
'cause he professional and he suggest that we don't sell dope
suggest that we don't sell dope
and i guess it's true, but who the f*** are you?
who are you, tryna tell me who i am?
tryna tell me who i am?
who are you, tryna tell me what i'm not?
tryna tell me what i'm not

watching n****s argue, killing like a boss do
with my hell up in harlem, hat in hand
with a girl named pat, she more than a waitress
to order a drink with
she divorced a banker, and bought the bar
she got an automobile, she gives an order to kill
you get caught and robbed
we could see your walk is off, you could lose your rhythm
when you walk in the gutter for a while
you easily go to soft from hard
now we all about hustlers, number runners
hoes and sharks and we all know the code of the block
and you talking some gibberish, anti n**** shit
'cause you marched back with rosa parks
brother don't start, go build your noah's ark
you could float to the end of the world
and pretend what you not, but i know what you are
while i roll in my car, and i'm spending my knot
while my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot
matter of fact, you're an easier target
and i respect everything you accomplished
but i hope i never get old and talk that nonsense

he said one glance is all it took ya
she's a real looker
they say her old mans a bootlegger
transporting in any weather
and at this rate we'll never get her
fellas, think it's time to call it a night

waiter another round for the gang
it's strange how i always felt outta place
joe the butcher's my ace, but in comes freckle face
so i said see you later
'fore i hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
he met them in louisiana wrestling gators
an idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
so i pulled the revolver on my waist up
between the patrol car and the gray truck
behind the street lamp was a silouhette
white gloves and a real long cigarette
what do ya know all this time she's got me in her scope
she spoke says the devil got you guys by the throat
your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
that's the reason why eric b is not president

she says,  i'll tell you a we hit the bodega got her a few 40's
we jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
drinks like a fish now she's past tipsy
the truth came out as we got to her suave house
 her mouth and sat me on the couch
i said it's gettin late c'mon give it to me straight
who's ya sponsor lady? she says bill gates
what are ya born 77 or 78?
she says, nah it goes way to an earlier date
slave times, claims the slaves said rhymes
but she fell in love with some fella named clive

she said clive campbell
he's kool herc
ah ha! ah ha!

she said if you really love me i'll come back alive"
"lies and the pain
betrayal; life
in danger's face
look what you're facing, gave your heart away
and all the remedies couldn't ease the pain
all the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
in a world so cold
you gain your life just to lose your soul
never thinking twice bout what the future holds
all the lies and the games not worth fighting for
the world is an addiction
serving up a fix
the world is an addiction
it's way too much for me
snitches and rapists in the street
crime to the fullest
asking n****s if they got any extra nine bullets
they deny me that
they know the bullets they loan me
be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out
letter t
it's better to dead a beef than let it breathe
then we don't succeed
cause then you gotta murder dummies
waste your time, they allergic to money
i'm never squirmish to blood
we can thug and get out of hand
what's the options
only conclusion is shooting
bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
fear any day that the feds will come knocking
was young and nervous
asking myself what's my purpose
in the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
pigs ignoring, i'm asking what precinct they taking me
these cops can't relate to me
death to prison, empty vacancy
thou shall not be selfish, real n**** commandments
know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
guess how angry this man gets
had so many bad chicks in his bed
strange sex, same sex
has addictions that are sadistic
chain of events, habits
he puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
self esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
pastors quote biblical chapters, psalms
all along he's into bestiality porn
and it's wrong, so i keep the cali weed in the bong
and i'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
and these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high so they find dough
to mainline dope, and ya'll know
so many vices, habits
mine of course, bad chicks
my response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
i'm just rebellious, not selfish
guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
i need the best things in life, that's women, that's cars
cigars in venice, bottle on ice, that's priceless
the other night, just in the emergency room
a patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
he can barely concentrate cause he's newly separated
his estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
in the house they were married in, mad people waiting
some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
filling out an application cause they all need medication
but the doctor need love or a quick vacation
calling up his travel agent
same time, premedidating murdering his ex wife
life, savage ain't it
some need xanax just to maintain it
we all need faith cause the world keep changing
let go of the illusion, start some restraining
just hold on"
"yeah
i don't work this hard to be around people i don't like
uh, yeah
gotta be a special type n**** to deal with my life
gotta be a special type n**** to feel what i write

won't let me pass it
i don't see the point with weak sayings like
""all them n****s on top be blocking, "" or never help, man, stop it
it's hard watching brothers who smart but think they not
i need them to realize what they got is a fresh start
that brother that you claim so powerful
the one you said he has a whole lot of pull
probably already tried to pull his brothers up
and got betrayed, got snaked, got played
meanwhile he balance his challenges, hard to keep himself paid
it's so hard for him, even though his talent is god given
pardon him, stop putting your faults on him
what he did to you now?
the man in him is bringing the kid in you out
you kid him, he still playin' the victim, you weirdin' me out
that's what my perspective is, maybe 'cause i'm a specialist
sippin' mixed liquor beverages
six figure checks are big, but eight figure checks and you rich
the nas enthusiasts thinkin' they know what's best for me
more than i know what's best for me, no rest for me
gotta be a special type n**** to deal with my life gotta be a special type n**** to feel what i write
special like my classics
special like my listeners who have attachments to my old style
won't let me pass it
special yeah, it's a privilege, vsop shit special very special 
hit, turn up the sample, we makin' magic
this thing is bigger than i could ever imagine
duckin' the flashes from the cameras, leave out the back
jump in a spacecraft, we can't tell where we at
chauffeur drivin' like a high speed chase, truck full of smack
tallest buildin' in manhattan, sippin' on manhattan's
listen to the manhattan's, queens to brooklyn, oh what a feelin'
i shoulda had grammy's when ol' dirty said ""wu for the children""
shoulda did that remix verse on gimme the loot for biggie
me, jay, and frank white is like cole, drizzy, and kenny
one girl for the rest of your life, is that realistic?
some had told me they like when you call 'em all types of b****es
ran through a few of them, some gangsta, some christian
some with a heart full of hate for me, even with a new n****
they label me a sinner because i left with they soul
there's really no other feelin' havin' that type of control, n****
gotta be special type woman to deal with my life
gotta be special type woman to feel what i write
special like my classics
special like my listeners who have attachments to my old style

"we use the word everyday
now we don't know the capacity of this word
are we headed for conflict or not? because we did not break down the capacity

it's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
we gotta strip the word down rugged and raw

they got nigeria and niger, two different countries
somehow niger turned to n****, and shit got ugly
the problem is we started thinking like the colonists
'til noble drew ali started droppin' that consciousness
my father was not a banker, neither was my neighbor
when it came to gettin' paper who the hell was gonna train us?
oppresion couldn't escape us through the ages
we changed the basis of derogatory phrases
and i say it's quite amazing
the use of ghetto terms developed out own language
no matter where it came from
it's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one
every word we use, it has a capacity
and if you don't understand the words you're using
and understand the capacity of it
you are using words that is creating a destiny for you
that you don't even know, or even conscious of"

to where black kings and ghana stay
so i could get on my flesh right away

when my gat don't need to spray
when these streets are safe to play
sex with death, indulge in these women
vision my own skeleton swimmin in eternal fire
broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
like the exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
i beg for god's help, why they love hurtin me?
i'm your disciple, a thug certainly
i'm the n the a to the s i r
if i wasn't i must've been escobar
forty five in my waist, starin at my reflection
in the mirror, sittin still in the chair like my conception
when everything around me got cloudy, the chair became a king's throne
my destiny found me
it was clear why the struggle was so painful
metamorphosis, this is what i changed to
and god, i'm so thankful"
