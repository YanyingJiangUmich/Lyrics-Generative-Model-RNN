on this harvest moon.
when we were strangers
i watched you from afar
when we were lovers
i loved you with all my heart.

and the moon is climbin' high
i want to celebrate

"morning has come with the first rays of sun
breaking through our windowpane
songs fill the air but there's no singer there
just an old wooden guitar playin'
writing this song won't take very long
trying not to use the word ""old""
thinking about taking chances and doubts
that still linger in the cold
looking forward, all that i can see
is good things happening to you and to me
i'm not waiting for times to change
i'm gonna live like a free roaming soul
on the highway of our love

people shufflin' their feet
people sleepin' in their shoes
there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead
there's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
don't feel like satan, but i am with them
so i try to forget it any way i can.
keep on rockin' in the free world,
keep on rockin' in the free world
keep on rockin' in the free world,
keep on rockin' in the free world.
i see a woman in the night with a baby in her hand
at an old street light near a garbage can
now she put her kid away, she's gone to get a hit
she hates her life, and what she's done with it
there's one more kid that will never go to school
never get to fall in love, never get to be cool.

there is no reason for you to hide
it's so hard for me staying here all alone

yeah, she could drag me over the rainbow, send me away
down by the river i shot my baby
down by the river,
dead, oh, shot her dead.
you take my hand, i'll take your hand
together we may get away
this much madness is too much sorrow
it's impossible to make it today.

"looking through a wavy glass window
in this old place by the lake
in the colors of the falling leaves
i see that nature makes no mistake
in the water as it ripples in the wind
there's a message i see of what's to come
in the honkers flying low above the waves
that's the reason this song is sung
song of the seasons coming through me now
like the wind in your hair
we're so together in the way that we feel
that we could wind up anywhere
looking through this clear vinyl window
at the city and its lights
masked people walking everywhere
it's humanity in my sights
from over there i see you waving at me
i feel the lightness in your step
i see the flicker of your loving eyes
in the stories that our love has kept
song of the seasons coming through me now
like the wind in your hair
we're so together in the way that we feel
that we could end up anywhere
i see the palace where the queen still reigns
behind her walls and lonesome gates
the king is gone now and she remains
i feel her banner's rippling in the rain
here in this water as it gathers now
upon the road, the horses gait
in the rhythm that i feel somehow
in the melody i play
song of the seasons coming through me now
like the wind in your hair
we're so together in the way that we feel
that we could end up anywhere"
"once i thought i saw you in a crowded hazy bar,
dancing on the light from star to star.
far across the moonbeam i know that's who you are,
i saw your brown eyes turning once to fire.
you are like a hurricane
there's calm in your eye.
and i'm gettin' blown away
to somewhere safer where the feeling stays.
i want to love you but i get so blown away.
i am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream,
you could have been anyone to me.
before that moment you touched my lips
that perfect feeling when time just slips
away between us on our foggy trip.
you are like a hurricane
there's calm in your eye.
and i'm gettin' blown away
to somewhere safer where the feeling stays.
i want to love you but i'm getting blown away.

"this is it, this is where we make a stand
you and me, time to face this man to man
can't you see we cannot go on
it's me against me again
i'm sick of the man i am within
fighting me, making me fall down again
i commit, i'll commit your suicide
now death will breath you in
sitting here at my graveside i've
never been so alive
you pulled the dead man out of me
i am not what i was, never again what i was
you pulled the dead man out of me
i buried you, you where nearly my demise
it's only by the grace of god that i survived
i admit i was wrong to let you in
never come back again
i can see all the possibilities rising up
now that you're not pulling me down
this is where i say goodbye
and put the last bullet between your eyes"
"there ain't no way i'm gonna let the good times go
there ain't no way i'm gonna let the good times go

when she makes me feel right that's when the good times roll

my blue eyed woman is a mystery to me
my blue eyed woman is a mystery to me
the touch of my woman can soothe my soul
when she makes me feel right that's when the good times roll

way out on the prairie where the wheat fields grow
way out on the prairie back where the wheat fields grow
i stop to slap plastic at an esso station
about a thousand miles from my destination
oh, she's a healer to me
oh yeah, she's a healer to me

and i don't try to hide it when i play my guitar

"i'm an accident
i was driving way too fast
couldn't stop though
so i let the moment last
i'm for rollin'
i'm for tossin' in my sleep
it's not guilt though
it's not the company i keep
people my age
they don't do the things i do
they go somewhere
while i run away with you
i got my friends
and i got my children too
i got her love
she's got my love too
i can't hear you
but i feel the things you say
i can't see you
but i see what's in my way
now i'm floatin'
cause i'm not tied to the ground
words i've spoken
seem to leave a hollow sound
on the long plain
see the rider in the night
see the chieftain
see the braves in cool moonlight
who will love them
when they take another life
who will hold them
when they tremble for the knife
voicemail numbers
on an old computer screen
rows of lovers
parked forever in a dream
screaming sirens
echoing across the bay
to the old boats
from the city far away
homeless heroes
walk the streets of their hometown
rows of zeros
on a field that's turning brown
they play baseball
they play football under lights
they play card games
and we watch them every night
need distraction
need romance and candlelight
need random violence
need entertainment tonight
need the evidence
want the testimony of
expert witnesses
on the brutal crimes of love
i was too tired
to see the news when i got home
pulled the curtain
fell into bed alone
started dreaming
saw the rider once again
in the doorway
where she stood and watched for him
watched for him
i'm not present
i'm a drug that makes you dream
i'm an aerostar
i'm a cutlass supreme
in the wrong lane
trying to turn against the flow
i'm the ocean
i'm the giant undertow
i'm the ocean
i'm the ocean
i'm the giant undertow
i'm the ocean
i'm the giant undertow
i'm the ocean
i'm the ocean
i'm the ocean
i'm the ocean
i'm the ocean
i'm the ocean"
"the flash from a distant camera
reconnecting thoughts and actions
fragments of our missing dream
pieces from here and there
fall in place along the line
disappearing between you and me
life is changing everywhere i go
new things and old both disappear
if life is a photograph fading in the mirror
all i want is a song of love
song of love to sing for you
all i need is this song of love
to sing for you.
on the floor where daylight dances
with the ones that missed their chances
when they couldn't let it show
lies the land of sweet surrender
like a dream it might have ended there
but we didn't even know
now forever we will live as one,
floating in love's atmosphere
if love is a piece of dust shining in the sun,
all i want is a song of love
song of love to sing to you
all i need is this song for love
to sing for you
song of love
song of love"

you changed my life for the better
wore my love like your favorite sweater
that brings me back to the shape of you
shape of you, shape of you
shape of you
no reason to pretend different
it's just that i'm still dreaming
and my dreams all have you
the shape of you
yeah, i'm older now, but i'm still dreaming
the sky is what i believe in
stars scatter in the shape of you
yeah, you're in my milky way

"my life is changing in so many ways
i don't know who to trust anymore
there's a shadow running thru my days
like a beggar going from door to door.
i was thinking that maybe i'd get a maid
find a place nearby for her to stay.
just someone to keep my house clean,
fix my meals and go away.
a maid. a man needs a maid.
a maid.
it's hard to make that change
when life and love turns strange.
and old.
to give a love, you gotta live a love.
to live a love, you gotta be ""part of""
when will i see you again?
a while ago somewhere i don't know when
i was watching a movie with a friend.
i fell in love with the actress.
she was playing a part that i could understand.

"they were hiding behind hay bales,
they were planting in the full moon
they had given all they had for something new
but the light of day was on them,
they could see the thrashers coming
and the water shone like diamonds in the dew.
and i was just getting up, hit the road before it's light
trying to catch an hour on the sun
when i saw those thrashers rolling by,
looking more than two lanes wide
i was feelin' like my day had just begun.
where the eagle glides ascending
there's an ancient river bending
down the timeless gorge of changes
where sleeplessness awaits
i searched out my companions,
who were lost in crystal canyons
when the aimless blade of science
slashed the pearly gates.
it was then i knew i'd had enough,
burned my credit card for fuel
headed out to where the pavement turns to sand
with a one way ticket to the land of truth
and my suitcase in my hand
how i lost my friends i still don't understand.
they had the best selection,
they were poisoned with protection
there was nothing that they needed,
nothing left to find
they were lost in rock formations
or became park bench mutations
on the sidewalks and in the stations
they were waiting, waiting.
so i got bored and left them there,
they were just deadweight to me
better down the road without that load
brings back the time when i was eight or nine
i was watchin' my mama's t.v.,
it was that great grand canyon rescue episode.
where the vulture glides descending
on an asphalt highway bending
thru libraries and museums, galaxies and stars
down the windy halls of friendship
to the rose clipped by the bullwhip
the motel of lost companions
waits with heated pool and bar.
but me i'm not stopping there,
got my own row left to hoe
just another line in the field of time
when the thrashers comes, i'll be stuck in the sun
like the dinosaurs in shrines
but i'll know the time has come
to give what's mine."

"she used to work in a diner
never saw a woman look finer
i used to order just to watch her float across the floor
she grew up in a small town
never put her roots down
daddy always kept movin', so she did too.
somewhere on a desert highway
she rides a harley davidson
her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind
she's been runnin' half her life
the chrome and steel she rides
collidin' with the very air she breathes
the air she breathes.
you know it ain't easy
you got to hold on
she was an unknown legend in her time
now she's dressin' two kids
lookin' for a magic kiss
she gets the far away look in her eyes.

how could i see you and stay too long?
all along the navajo trail,
burn outs stub their toes on garbage pails.
waitresses are cryin' in the rain
will their boyfriends pass this way again?
oh, mother goose, she's on the skids
sure ain't happy, neither are the kids.
she needs someone that she can scream at

i guess i'll call it sickness gone

there's room at the top for private detection.

but it's either that or pay off the kidnapper.

to keep their lands away from the greedy
who only plunder for themselves
all the people in the whole wide world
nobody matters but you and me
when it comes to protecting our precious gift
 it's the big scene from the movies
 where the gunslinger rides away
 outside a town past the needy
 and the rows of soldiers' graves
 they fought the wars we thought we needed
 they never asked us for a thing
 and we believed in what we were doin'
 while the earth is givin' way
of all the feelings in the whole wide world
i can't begin to do or say
anything but protect our precious gift
it's a new day for the planet
it's a new day for the sun
to shine down on what we're doin'
it's a new day for love"

gonna leave the fools in line

and focused on the ocean's daughter

dancing in the sunset hews
she waved to me and called me over

for me it's not over...
talkin' bout a friend of mine
talkin' bout a gold mine
richest vein in any mountain
talkin' bout the enemy
inside of me
talkin' bout that youthful fountain
talkin' bout you and me
talkin' bout eternity
talkin' bout the big time

with his galleons and guns
looking for the new world
and that palace in the sun.
on the shore lay montezuma
with his coca leaves and pearls
in his halls he often wondered
with the secrets of the worlds.
and his subjects gathered 'round him
like the leaves around a tree
in their clothes of many colors
for the angry gods to see.
and the women all were beautiful
and the men stood straight and strong
they offered life in sacrifice
so that others could go on.
hate was just a legend
and war was never known
the people worked together
and they lifted many stones.
they carried them to the flatlands
and they died along the way

he was sure he was right
he had all of the lowdown
from the bank heist last night
his best friend was the robber
and his wife was a thief
all the children were killers
they couldn't get no relief
the bungalow was surrounded
when a voice loud and clear
said, come on out with your hands up
or we'll blow you out of here.
there was a face in the window
the tv cameras rolled
then they cut to the announcer
and the story was told.
the artist looked at the producer
the producer sat back
he said, what we have got here
is a perfect track
but we don't have a vocal
and we don't have a song
if we could get these things accomplished
nothin' else could go wrong.
so he balanced the ashtray
as he picked up the phone
and said, send me a songwriter
who's drifted far from home
and make sure that he's hungry
make sure he's alone
send me a cheeseburger
and a new rolling stone.
yeah.
there's still crime in the city,
said the cop on the beat,
i don't know if i can stop it
i feel like meat on the street
they paint my car like a target
i take my orders from fools
meanwhile some kid blows my head off
well, i play by their rules
that's why i'm doin' it my way
i took the law in my hands
so here i am in the alleyway

i get paid by a ten year old

there's still crime in the city
but it's good to be free.
yeah.

that has a broken home
sometimes i talk to daddy
on the telephone
when he says that he loves me
i know that he does
but i wish i could see him
i wish i knew where he was
but that's the way all my friends are
except maybe one or two
wish i could see him this weekend
wish i could walk in his shoes
but now i'm doin' my own thing
sometimes i'm good, then i'm bad
although my home has been broken
it's the best home i ever had
yeah.
well, i keep gettin' younger
my life's been funny that way
before i ever learned to talk
i forgot what to say
i sassed back to my mom
i sassed back to my teacher
i got thrown out of bible school
for sassin' back at the preacher
then i grew up to be a fireman
put out every fire in town
put out anything smokin'
but when i put the hose down
the judge sent me to prison
he gave me life without parole

the seqoritas crying at the well.
up in the gold hotel
the money hits the table
the heavies all are there
that's why the deal's goin' down
beautiful women all dressed in
diamonds and sable
down upon the street
beside a garbage heap
a mariachi band begins to play.
somewhere a blues guitar
plays echoes in the alleyway
the tijuana dawn
claims another day
the golden sun
rises on the runway
the pilot understands
the money changes hands
inside the jet the briefcase snaps. goodbye.

"let's go to florida
palm trees and shit man palm trees  and humid weather
it was like a town in florida in the, in the fifties you know
i don't know, there's a lot of white buildings, and
they were really white, i could see them
were about seven or eight stories tall, all the
all the people were walking around, and
it just looks so good, you know, they all had, uh
blue dresses and nice pants on, you know, they're
all of them are drinking pop from, you know
with straws in the bottles
things were lookin', you know, sun was shining so bright
the downtown looked incredible, i couldn't believe it, there was
gliders flyin' around in the sky
these guys flying around in gliders, you know, and
they'd swoop between the buildings and they
they go down the alley ways, you know
and make a sharp left and a sharp right
and, uh, it's like they
i couldn't believe that it was really happening, you know
so i said, you know, ""i don't believe this; this isn't real""
and just as i said that, this guy in the glider, it was
coming right through the center of town
and he ran into the building in the middle of town
fifteen story high building, right in the center of town
he started tumbling through the air, you know
and his glider crashed in the alley and, uh
i noticed this couple on the, uh, on the parking lot
and, uh, they, they were just walking together in conversation, you know
like nothing else was happening
and, uh, looking up they noticed a tumbling man coming through the air
and uh, he, he came right down
and landed right on them and made an awful sound
and, uh, i ran over there, i could see
that they were really gone, you know
but on the ground beside them was this little baby
dressed in—it just had a red blanket wrapped around it
so i picked it up and took it to my car
over on the corner which wasn't too far away
and i put it in the back seat
i don't know whether it was a boy or a girl
i didn't look, you know, i just put it down
it was sleeping and i looked
and a crowd had gathered on the parking lot
this beautiful lady was coming down the street
and i looked at her and she looked right at me, and
she said, ""that's my baby in the back of your car there""
i said, ""oh no, that baby belongs to that
to that dead couple on the parking lot""
and she said, ""no, no you're wrong, you're wrong
what happened to them? """

"we watch the old news
distracted as they talked on and on in the usual way
about the latest lies, deceptions
we saw tomorrow, we long for a better day
and i know why green is blue
there's so much we didn't do
oh, i know why green is blue
we heard the warning calls, ignored them
we saw the weather change, we saw the fires and floods
we saw the people rise, divided
we fought each other while we lost our coveted prize
there's so much we didn't do
that we knew we had to do
and we know why green is blue
we watched the species die, we saw the coral turning
we watched the oceans rise
we saw the pot of whales lay bloated
on the shore where they baked, but we missed that sign
we saw the polar bear, she floated
on a piece of ice from another time
so i know"
"the night was cold
and the wind was howling
i was awaken by the sound
of hoof beats pounding.
outside the window, on the ground
our hound dog was growling
grey riders flew across my lawn
i looked again and they all were gone.
that voice was calling
and it cut through the night
come on boys, let her go.
up on a hill
they rode in one long column
they were freezing with the chills
of the new day dawning.
their hair long and grey
they heard just one voice calling
grey riders on the morning sky,
the sun made diamonds of their road weary eyes.
that voice is calling
and it cut through the night
come on boys, let her go.

"there's a guardian angel
watching over you, yeah
better mind your ways...just
might leave on you
in the darkness who else
is really with you?
only you alone
got to live with you all the time
when there's no more time
and nothin' left to do
who will hear you?
who will hear your heart?
your guardian angel
who are these kindred spirits?
would you know them if they
stood in front of you?
from below the loneliness eats at you
try the telephone
someone might listen for a while
when there's no more time
and nothin' left to do
who will hear you?
who will hear your heart?
your guardian angel
when a passing stranger
looks away from you
an uneasy feelin' starts comin' over you
there's somebody watching somewhere
maybe today it's you
comes a desperate urge to run
guardian angel where are you?
when there's no more time
and nothin' left to do
who will hear you?
who will hear your heart?
your guardian angel"

she taught him how to dance and start again

the last time i saw elvis
he was shooting at a colour tv
the phones were ringing in the pink motel
and the rest is history
he was the king
the last time i saw elvis
he was singing a gospel song
you could tell he had the feeling
and the whole world sang along
he was the king
the last time i saw elvis
he was up on the silver screen
pushing a plough in a black and white movie
and everybody started to scream
yes, he was the king
the last time i saw elvis
it was some kind of vegas dream
spotlights flashed on a silver cape
and a blue haired lady screamed
he was the king
the last time i saw elvis
he was fronting a three piece band
rocking on the back of a flatbed truck
with an old guitar in his hand
he was the king
the last time i saw elvis
the last time i saw elvis
he was riding in a pink cadillac
wind was blowing through his hair
and he never did look back
he was the king
thank you very much

pulled my wagon all through the town

heading west to find the good old days
good old days, good old days

they can relax and watch the sun
rise above all
of the beautiful things
they've done.
go to the country take the dog
look at the sky without the smog
see the world laugh
at the farmers feeding hogs
eat hot dogs.
what a pity
that the people from the city
can't relate to the slower things
that the country brings.
time itself is bought and sold.
the spreading fear of growing old
contains a thousand foolish games
that we play.
while people
planning trips to stars
allow another boulevard to claim
a quiet country lane
it's insane.
so the subtle face is a loser
this time around.

where the showman
shifts the gears
lives become careers

came visiting me last night
surrounded my old stagecoach

don't listen to me
it ain't paradise

just a hippie dream.
don't bat an eye
don't waste a word
don't mention nothin'
that could go unheard
'cause the tie dye sails
are the screamin' sheets
and the dusty trail
leads to blood in the streets
and the wooden ships
are a hippie dream
capsized in excess

just because it's over for you
don't mean it's over for me
it's a victory for the heart

don't kill the machine

bumper to bumper in a giant cloud of fumes
 from city to city everyone is on the move

for the one that makes me weep
i dried my eyes to greet the day
and wondered why i have to pay
the tears that i have shed by day
give relief and wash away
the mem'ry of the life before
i wonder if i'll suffer more
i wonder if i care as much
as i did before
my pride is made to say forgive
and take the blame for what you did
it's your mistake i'm thinkin' of
i wonder if i'm still in love

i would, or would she leave me?

like to do anything
i would, or would she leave me?

where the heartaches come

because the ending's just too hard to take
i'd walk away like a movie star
who gets burned in a three way script
enter number two
a movie queen to play the scene
of bringing all the good things out in me

"once there was an inca queen
she gazed at her sundial
all around her workers raised
golden idols to her smile
the waiting years weren't hard to see
behind the tears of mercury.
she spoke of silver from the sky
and many floating safety boats
to pick them up when they would fly
far above their dreams and hopes
and they a mountain city raised
where their queen above the clouds
could watch out.
inca queen has, inca queen has, inca queen has come
inca queen has, inca queen has, inca queen has come.
out in the jungle the drums were heard: inca queen has come
from the biggest elephant to the smallest bird: inca queen has come
she spoke of silver from the sky, inca queen has come
to pick them up when they would fly, inca queen has come.
once there was an inca queen
she gazed at her sundial
all around her workers raised
golden idols to her smile
and though the air was thin and cold
soon the day would come the queen had told.
inca queen has, inca queen has, inca queen has come."

our brothers and sisters have to take a stand
against us now for what we all been doing
on the sacred land there's a battle brewing
i wish somebody would share the news
now it's been about 500 years
we keep taking what we gave away
just like what we call indian givers
it makes you sick and gives you shivers
i wish somebody would share the news
big money going backwards and ripping the soil
where graves are scattered and blood was boiled
when all who look can see the truth
but they just move on and keep their groove
i wish somebody would share the news
saw happy locked to the big machine
they had to cut him loose and you know what that means
that's when happy went to jail
behind big money justice always fails
i wish somebody would share the news
bring back the days when good was good
lose these imposters in our neighborhood
across our farms and through our waters
all at the cost of our sons and daughters
our brave songs and daughters
we're all here together fighting poison waters
standing against the evil way
that's what we have at the end of day
i wish somebody would share the news"

i count the voices one by one
but i'm not there to share the fun
i'm out on the interstate
i can hear a soft voice calling
calling me to bring my guitar home
i'm happy singing in a crowd
the lights are bright, the music's loud
i like to look in every face
but out on the interstate
i can hear a soft voice calling
calling me to bring my guitar home
out in the dusty desert wind
the fox goes looking for a friend
she sees a light around the bend
i'm out on the interstate
i can hear a soft voice calling
calling me to bring my guitar home"

honey, you always come across my mind
is it the way that you hold me
or the way that you told me love is blind
well, it's a crime of the heart
these things i'm thinking to myself

just can't seem to think of nothing else.
got a woman at home
a family to feed
three fine children
they think the lord of me
now i'm standing at the crossroads
looking for a sign of true love.
well, i heard that song
says girls just wanna have fun
well, i guess i bought my ticket, honey
'cause it feels as if the ride has just begun
well, there's two kinds of love
one is wrong and one is right

can't forget the way you hold me tight.

of the birds outside on the roof
i try to ignore what the paper says

'cause you and i been through so many things together
and the sun starts climbing the roof
it's a dream
only a dream
and it's fading now
fading away
it's only a dream
just a memory without anywhere to stay
the red river stills flows through my home town
rollin' and tumblin' on its way
swirling around the old bridge pylons
where a boy fishes the morning away
his bicycle leans on an oak tree
while the cars rumble over his head
an aeroplane leaves a trail in an empty blue sky
and the young birds call out to be fed
it's a dream
only a dream
and it's fading now
fading away
it's only a dream
just a memory without anywhere to stay
an old man walks along on the sidewalk
sunglasses and an old stetson hat
the four winds blow the back of his overcoat away
as he stops with the policeman to chat
and a train rolls out of the station
that was really somethin' in its day
picking up speed on the straight prairie rails
as it carries the passengers away
it's gone
only a dream
and it's fading now
fading away
only a dream
just a memory without anywhere to stay
it's a dream
only a dream

"in a matter of time,
there'll be a friend of mine
gonna come to the coast,
you're gonna see him
up close for a minute or two
while the ground cracks under you.
by the look in your eyes
you'd think that it was a surprise
but you seem to forget
something somebody said
about the bubbles in the sea
and an ocean full of trees.
and you now, l.a.
uptight, city in the smog, city in the smog.
don't you wish that you could be here too?
don't you wish that you could be here too?
don't you wish that you could be here too?
well, it's hard to believe
so you get up to leave
and you laugh at the door
that you heard it all before
oh it's so good to know
that it's all just a show for you.
but when the suppers are planned
and the freeways are crammed
and the mountains erupt
and the valley is sucked
into cracks in the earth
will i finally be heard by you.
l.a.
uptight, city in the smog, city in the smog.
don't you wish that you could be here too?
don't you wish that you could be here too?
don't you wish that you could be here too?"

"well i hate to say the farmer was the last of a dying breed
living off the land and taking what he needs
don't say much for the future when a family can't survive
i hate to say the farmer was the last of his kind
in the struggle for parity, not one man's voice can sound
cuz the foundation of the conglomerate is firmly in the ground
yeah they wanna feed the world, but for power and for greed
then they'll cut off the supply until they get what they need
well i dreamed i saw a dustbowl where the farmers used to live
earth was flying thru the sky, it had nothing left to give
tractors were burning on the white house lawn
just woke up one morning and the farmers all were gone
well i hate to say the farmer was the last of a dying breed
living off the land and taking what he needs
don't say much for the future when a family can't survive
i hate to say the farmer was the last of his kind

"out on the old coast highway
flying through the night
jed got stopped by the chp
for speedin' and no brake lights
rolled down the driver's window
slipped his gun down under his seat
the glove box was full of cocaine
the trunk was full of weed
""driver's license and registration,""
said the officer with his flashlight
search around the floor, look hard
smellin' like something ain't right
jed's life flashed before him
like a scratchy old super 8
he heard the sound of the future
on an rpm 78
nothing was still, all was moving
when the flashlight found the gun
then jed pulled the trigger
in a split second tragic blunder
""it makes you think about living
what life has to tell,""
said jed to grandpa
from inside his cell
camouflage hung in his closet
guns all over the wall
plans for buildings and engineers
and a book with no numbers at all
the whole town was stunned
they closed the coast highway for twelve hours
no one could get in
jed was one of ours
meanwhile across the ocean
living in the internet
is the cause of an explosion
no one has heard yet
but there's no need to worry
there's no reason to fuss
just go on about your work now
and leave the drivin' to us
and we'll be watching you
no matter what you do
and you can do your part
by watchin' others too
grandpa put down the paper
staring in disbelief
jed had always been good to him
never gave him any grief
the moral of this story
is try not to get too old
the more time you spend on earth
the more you see unfold
and as an afterthought
this must, too, be told
some people have taken pure bullshit"
"here comes another day
and another
i got so many ills and pills
i'm about to smother
hit 39, leavin' the top 40 behind
holdin' on to what i got
i tried to tell myself
it doesn't matter
it's just the time of life
another rung in the ladder
each morning i
look in her sky blue eyes
the downside of life looks better
that old man standin' on the corner
he should be proud of those lines on his face
'cos either he's been laughin' too much
or feelin' too much pain
here comes another day

i am dreaming dear of you, day by day
dreaming when the skies are blue, when they're gray;
when the silv'ry moonlight gleams, still i wander on in dreams,
in a land of love, it seems, just with you.
let me call you ""sweetheart,"" i'm in love with you.
let me hear you whisper that you love me too.
keep the love light glowing in your eyes so true.
let me call you ""sweetheart,"" i'm in love with you.
longing for you all the while, more and more;
longing for the sunny smile, i adore;
birds are singing far and near, roses blooming ev'rywhere
you, alone, my heart can cheer; you, just you.
let me call you ""sweetheart,"" i'm in love with you.
let me hear you whisper that you love me too.
keep the love light glowing in your eyes so true."

"let’s impeach the president for lying
and leading our country into war
abusing all the power that we gave him
and shipping all our money out the door
he’s the man who hired all the criminals
the white house shadows who hide behind closed doors
and bend the facts to fit with their new stories
of why we have to send our men to war
let’s impeach the president for spying
on citizens inside their own homes
breaking every law in the country
by tapping our computers and telephones
what if al qaeda blew up the levees
would new orleans have been safer that way
sheltered by our government’s protection
or was someone just not home that day?
let’s impeach the president
for hijacking our religion and using it to get elected
dividing our country into colors
and still leaving black people neglected
thank god he’s racking down on steroids
since he sold his old baseball team
there’s lot of people looking at big trouble
but of course the president is clean
thank god"
"i know i said i love you
i know you know its true
i got to put the phone down
and do what we got to do
oneâ€™s standing in the aisle way
two more at the door
we got to get inside there
before they kill some more
time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll
time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll
no time for indecision we got to make a move
i hope that we're forgiven for what we got to do
how this all got started iâ€™ll never understand
hope someone can fly this thing and get us back to land
time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll
time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll
no one has the answer but one thing is true
you got to turn on evil when itâ€™s coming after you
you gotta face it down and when it tries to hide
we gotta go in after it and never be denied
time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll
lets roll for freedom
lets roll for love
going after satin on the wings of a dove
lets roll for justice
lets roll for truth
lets not let our children grow up fearful in their youth
time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll
time is runnin outâ€¦ lets roll"

"instead of cursing the darkness
light a candle for where we're goin'
there's something ahead worth looking for.
when the light of time is on us
we will see our moment come
and the living soul inside will carry on.
it's a chance to give new meaning
to every move we make
through the caverns in the caves
where we come from.
when the light of dawn is on us
we will see what we can be
and the ancient ones can sleep an easy sleep.
in the hallways of the ages
on the road to history
what we do now will always be with us
it's a chance to give new meaning
to every move we make
in the caverns in the caves
where we come from.

light a candle for where we're goin'
there's something ahead worth looking for.

light a candle in the darkness when you go."

but mostly they pray about love and war

caressing every young dream of the past

that death itself is freedom for evermore

"once i was in love
now, it seems that time
is better spent
searching than in finding
but no one seems to know.
so don't say you lose,
don't say you lose,
don't say you win,
and no one else will know,
no one else will know.
when you're down you gather strength
to leave the ground
and when you're high
it makes you weak and you fall back down.

now, it seems that time
is better spent

"see the bluebird fly easy as a dream
dipping and bobbing in the sun
could she be the one i saw so long ago
could she be the one to take me home
this pasture is green
i'm walking in the sun
it's turning brown
i'm standing in the rain
my overcoat is worn
the pockets are all torn
i'm moving away from the pain
tick tock
the clock on the wall
no wonder we're losing time
ring, ring
the old church bell
the bride and her love
seeking guidance from above
amber waves of grain bow in the prairie wind
i'm hearing willie singing on the radio again
that song from 9/11 keeps ringing in my head
i'll always remember something chris rock said
don't send no more candles
no matter what you do
then willie stopped singing
and the prairie wind blew
the green kept rolling on
for miles and miles
fields of fuel rolling on for miles
tick tock
the clock on the wall
no wonder we're losing time
toll, toll
the fallen soldier bell
the old church on the hill
still standing when so many fell
back when i was young, the birds blocked out the sun
before the great migration south
we only shot a few
they last the winter through
mother cooked them good and served them up
somewhere a senator sits in a leather chair
behind a big wooden desk
the caribou we killed mean nothing to him
he took his money just like all the rest
tick tock
the clock on the wall
no wonder we're losing time
ring, ring
ring the wedding bells
the bride takes the ring
and the happy people sing"
"there's plenty of food on the table
lots of love in the house
the children all do what they're able to do
we got so much to be happy about.
i got a woman standing beside me
she really knows how to stand by her man
she's strong and she's soft and she's honest to me
she really helps me to be a good man.
but nothing is perfect in god's perfect plan
look in the shadow to see
he only gave us the good things so we'd understand
what life without them would be.
there's plenty of wheat on the prairies
lots of coal in the mines
we got soldiers so strong they can bury their dead
and still not go back shooting blind.
there's women and men on the workforce
doing forty hours plus overtime
so the hostages held at the airport
can come home to something worthwhile.
but nothing is perfect in god's perfect plan

he only gave us the good things so we'd understand

moved in to pick up the pace, a factory full of people.
makin' parts to go to outer space, a train load of people.

the house and the boat and the railroad car, the owner's gotta go to jail.
he acquired these things from a life of crime, now he's selling them to raise his bail.
he was rippin' off the people.
sellin' guns to the underground, tryin' to help the people.
lose their ass for a piece of ground, rippin' off the people.
skimmin' the top when there was no one around, tryin' to help the people.
he was dealing antiques in a hardware store but he sure had a lot to hide.
he had a backroom full of the guns of war and a ton of ammunition besides.
well, he walked with a cane, kept a bolt on the door with five pit bulls inside,
just a warning to the people
who might try to break in at night, protection from the people.
selling safety in the darkest night, tryin' to help the people.
get the drugs to the street all right, ordinary people.

confiscatin' all the dealer's land, patch of ground people.

and they don't know how they go there, ordinary people.
and they think that you don't care, hard workin' people.
down on the assembly line, they keep puttin' the same thing out.

two out of work models and a fashion slave try to dance away the michelob night.
the bartender poured himself another drink, while two drunks sat watchin' the fight.

he was fightin' for the people.
but his timing wasn't right, for las vegas people
who came to see a las vegas fight, high rollin' people.
takin' limos though the neon night, fightin' for the people.

of downtown people.
tryin' to make their way to work, nose to the stone people.

they're scrubbin' the boiler down, well, she really is lookin' fine.
awe, she's lookin' so good, they're gonna bring her back on line,

i'm like an eagle, i like to fly high
i'm like a snake, i like to lay low
i'm like a black man, i'm like a white man
maybe a red man, i don't know.
i'm just a passenger on this old freight train
i ride the boxcar through the night
i doesn't matter where i might get off"
"this one's for you al freed,
wherever you go, whatever you do
'cause the things they're doing today
will make a saint out of you
payola blues.
i've got the payola blues
even though i already paid my dues.
listen to me mr. d.j., hear what i've got to say
if a man is making music, they ought to let his record play.
payola blues
no matter where i go
i never hear my record on the radio.
well, here's three thousand, that ought to get it on.
well, thanks a lot man! i love your new song.
payola blues
no matter where i go
i never hear my record on the radio.
and it goes like this.
i got a brand new record company, new manager too.
got a great new record, i can't get through to you.
payola blues
no matter where i go
i never hear my record on the radio.
how about this new mercedes benz, that ought to get it on.
well, thanks a lot man! i'll play it all day long.
payola blues
no matter where i go
i never hear my record on the radio.
i've got the payola blues, payola blues
i'm paying those payola blues
no matter where i go"
"some lyrics by eddie vedder.
peace and love
flying so high
peace and love
too young to die
peace and love
now you decide
stay for the children
you don't really want to go
can't feel it pulling like you did
peace and love
peace and love
only a ride
strength is gone
dying inside
tell me now
what did you find
found love in the people
livin' in a sacred land
found love in the people
peace and love
found love saw my mistake
broke walls of pain to walk again
i saw the dream
i saw the wake
we shared it all
but not the take
peace and love
lennon's goodbye
over now
living in time
a broken bell
a nursery rhyme
deserted by heroes
strangers in your own land
no way to deny you
no way to deny you
peace and love
i took it all
i took the oath
i took it all
til i had most
i took what's left
i gave it breath
i had it all once
i gave it back"
"you know it takes a long, long time
you know it takes a long, long time
you love her so and still you know
that you will never want to let her go
unless you leave her first
then you come out on top
but, still there's just one thing
you haven't got.
peace of mind
like when you treated her kind
it's hard to face that open space.
you know it takes a long, long time
you know it takes a long, long time
when first you gave and shared your soul
showed her all those things that take their toll
she knows your weak spot
but, she still gets you hot
so you do it again
reveal what lies within.
and go for peace of mind
like when you treated her kind
it's hard to face that open space.
you're lookin' for peace of mind
anywhere you can find
still searchin' for peace of mind.
you know it takes a long, long time"
"one day shots rang across the peaceful valley
god was crying tears that fell like rain
before the railroad came from kansas city
and the bullets hit the bison from the train
shots rang across the peaceful valley
white man laid his foot upon the plain.
the wagon train rolled through the dusty canyon
the settlers full of wonder as they crossed
a gentle creek where two old oaks were standing
before the west was won there was a cost
a rain of fire came down upon the wagons
a mother screamed and every soul was lost.
change hit the country like a thunderstorm
ancient rivers soon began to boil
people rushed like water to california
at first they came for gold and then for oil
fortunes were made and lost in lifetimes
mother earth took poison in her soil.
an electro cruiser coasted towards the exit
and turned on peaceful valley boulevard
""people make the difference"" read a billboard
above a long line of idling cars.
who'll be the one to lead this world
who'll be the beacon in the night
who'll be the one to lead this world
who'll be the beacon in the night
who'll be the one to lead the nations
and protect god's creations
a polar bear was drifting on an ice floe
sun beating down from the sky
politicians gathered for a summit
and came away with nothing to decide
storms thundered on, his tears of falling rain
a child was born and wondered why."
"people on the street need a place to go
people on the street need a place to go
walkin' with the beat if it's not too slow
walkin' with the beat if it's not too slow
when the night's dark shadow falls
on the sidewalk scenes and the concrete canyon walls.
people on the street need a place to go
people on the street need a place to go.
walkin' through the night up and down the avenue
lookin' for a place,
a place to go,
a place to go.
there's a muffled scream from the alley scene
from the alley scene comes a muffled scream
and the siren wails while the system fails
in the steaming heat people walk in the street
people can't run and hide
if you want to feel good then you gotta feel good inside.
people on the street need a place to go
people on the street need a place to go.
rising through the grates come the fumes of industry
floating to the sky
keep walkin' with the beat, walkin' with the beat
keep walkin' with the beat, walkin' with the beat
keep walkin' with the beat, walkin' with the beat
when the night's dark shadow falls
on the sidewalk scenes and the concrete canyon walls.
people on the street need a place to go
people on the street need a place to go."

"tried to save the trees
bought a plastic bag
the bottom fell out
it was a piece of crap
saw it on the tube
bought it on the phone
now you're home alone
it's a piece of crap
i tried to plug in it
i tried to turn it on
when i got it home
it was a piece of crap
got it from a friend
on him you can depend
i found out in the end
it was a piece of crap
i'm trying to save the trees
i saw it on tv
they cut the forest down
to build a piece of crap
i went back to the store
they gave me four more
the guy told me at the door
it's a piece of crap"
"in the summertime
we met to see a thread
that came to harm something we both loved
and as the hours passed
we talked until at last it came the time to part
i was doin' well
and i thought she liked my style
i had no business thinking like that
but it lasted quite a while
i got my promises made
but before the time was, father
i show plastic flowers
to mother nature's daughter
she held the vase
her misty gaze brought them to life
i was amazed
she turned to me with a tear in her eye
we went to give our thanks
along the riverbanks
and watched the water flow as it rolled along
she scooped some river sand
and held it in her hand
and sang a little song
saw the water lines
left there from ancient times
i watched the sand run through her fingers
on the shore, so dry
i was doin' well
and i thought she liked my style
i had no business feeling like that
but it lasted quite a while
i got my promiese made
but before the time was, father

"aurora borealis
the icy sky at night
paddles cut the water
in a long and hurried flight
from the white man to the fields of green
and the homeland we've never seen.
they killed us in our tepee
and they cut our women down
they might have left some babies
cryin' on the ground
but the firesticks and the wagons come
and the night falls on the setting sun.
they massacred the buffalo
kitty corner from the bank
the taxis run across my feet
and my eyes have turned to blanks
in my little box at the top of the stairs
with my indian rug and a pipe to share.
i wish a was a trapper
i would give thousand pelts
to sleep with pocahontas
and find out how she felt
in the mornin' on the fields of green
in the homeland we've never seen.
and maybe marlon brando
will be there by the fire
we'll sit and talk of hollywood
and the good things there for hire
like the astrodome and the first tepee
marlon brando, pocahontas and me
marlon brando, pocahontas and me"
"look out, mama, there's a white boat comin' up the river
with a big red beacon, and a flag, and a man on the rail
i think you'd better call john,
'cause it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail
and it's less than a mile away
i hope they didn't come to stay
it's got numbers on the side and a gun
and it's makin' big waves.
daddy's gone, my brother's out hunting in the mountains
big john's been drinking since the river took emmy lou
so the powers that be left me here to do the thinkin'
and i just turned twenty two
i was wonderin' what to do
and the closer they got,
the more those feelings grew.
daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassurin'
he told me, red means run, son, numbers add up to nothin'
but when the first shot hit the docks i saw it comin'
raised my rifle to my eye
never stopped to wonder why.
then i saw black,
and my face splashed in the sky.
shelter me from the powder and the finger
cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger
think of me as one you'd never figured
would fade away so young
with so much left undone
remember me to my love,
i know i'll miss her."
"trying to remember what my daddy said
before too much time took away his head
he said we're going back and i'll show you what i'm talking about
going back to cypress river, back to the old farmhouse
i tried to tell the people but they never heard a word i say
they say there's nothing out there but wheat fields anyway
just a farmer's wife hanging laundry in her back yard
out on the prairie where the winds blow long and hard
late at night, lights dancing in the northern sky
like the indian spirits trying to show me how to fly
you can see into the future but it may be a mirage
like a new car sitting there in your old garage
there's a place on the prairie where evil and goodness play
daddy told me all about it but i don't remember what he said
it might be afternoon and it might be the dead of night
but you'll know when you see it 'cause it sure is a hell of a sight
prairie wind blowing through my head
trying to remember what daddy said
before too much time took away his head
he said we're going back and i'll show you what i'm talking about
going back to cypress river, back to the old farmhouse

"a funny thing happened yesterday
i felt the pressure in a brand new way
it kept hitting me from all directions
i got this feeling i was cracking up
my knees were shaking and i couldn't close my eyes
i fought to gain control and make corrections
a funny thing happened yesterday
i felt the pressure in a tv way.
don't feel, don't feel
feel pressure from me
don't feel, don't feel
no pressure from me
don't feel, don't feel
feel pressure from me.
you watch the box and the video jocks
if you could talk that could even be you up there
that's why you need max head room
too much pressure for peace on earth
too much tryin' to get your money's worth
too much dying
the eldorado, the mercedes benz
the job security that never ends.
don't feel, don't feel
feel pressure from me
don't feel, don't feel
no pressure from me
don't feel, don't feel

one of these days i'm gonna go out like a light

upon the green the first leaf falls
it's the prime of life and the king and queen
step out into the sun, 
are you feeling all right
not feeling too bad myself
are you feeling all right, my friend?
footsteps run down the castle hall
to the rooms of the paper doll
it's the prime of life, where the spirit grows
and the mirror shows both ways 
are you feeling all right
not feeling too bad myself
are you feeling all right, my friend?

wherever the party goes

from a doctor i can't buy."

there's another poor man falling down.
falling down, falling down.
falling down, falling down.
on this lazy shore
standing at the edge of you.
could those dreams of yours be true
or did you, did you, did you
pushed it over the end?
how much time did you spend?
pushed it over the end.
good lookin' milly's into politics now
and things are looking much better
she keeps ten men in her garage
knitting her fine sweaters.
at the end of a weary day
she feels hard and she looks hard.

there's another poor man falling down.
falling down, falling down.
falling down, falling down.

seems like lately things are going south
a few drinks now and she hardly knows him
he just looks way and shuts out
and when she says ""it's time to do something""
maybe talk to his old friends who gave it up
he just pours himself another tall one
closes his eyes and says ""that's enough""

to mend the tear that always shows.
it won't be long, it won't be long.
it's hard enough losin' the paper illusion you've hidden inside,
without the confusion of findin' you're usin' the crutch of the lie
to shelter your pride when you cry.
round and round and round we spin,
to weave a wall to hem us in,
it won't be long, it won't be long
how slow and slow and slow it goes,
to mend the tear that always shows.
it won't be long, it won't be long.
now you're movin' too slow and wherever you go there's another beside.
it's so hard to say no to yourself and it shows that you're losing inside,
when you step on your pride and you cry.
round and round and round we spin,
to weave a wall to hem us in,
it won't be long, it won't be long
how slow and slow and slow it goes,
to mend the tear that always shows.
it won't be long, it won't be long.
how the hours will bend through the time that you spend till you turn to your eyes,
and you see your best friend looking over the end and you turn to see why,
and he looks in your eyes and he cries.
round and round and round we spin,
to weave a wall to hem us in,
it won't be long, it won't be long
how slow and slow and slow it goes,
to mend the tear that always shows.
it won't be long, it won't be long."

"when the blues moved north, to chicago they came
and i caught some myself in this blind alley and rain
close to the l with it's clattering train
near an old ornate theater where i soon will be playing
i soon will be playing
so i said hello for you, when i saw a stylish girl
walking by on the sidewalk with her hair in a swirl
from the wind that was growing at the end of the day
and i wondered what would be coming my way
what would be coming my way, coming my way
you know i been to chicago, i was here once before
and the rain kept on pounding outside the stage door
i was singing and drinking with love in my heart
i was younger and stronger while life played it's part
while life played it's part, life played it's part
life played it's part
let us not be strangers if we come to know
things about each other that seem to come and go
'cause friendship is everything if love is to last
and i have my guard down and love passes fast
love passes fast, love passes fast
love passes fast

at the scenery around you
home of the brave
sometimes they leave you like they found you
sometimes they worship you
sometimes they tear your houses down
sometimes they comfort you
sometimes they spread your life around
nothing you can see
that they won't try to give you
land of the free
where the legend will outlive you
when you earn their trust
when you are truly in danger
where greed and lust
have never been a stranger
home of the brave
that's where heroes need protection
media images slaves
live by random selection
you sell your heart
but that's not the price of freedom
where things are useful
only when you need them
where will you go
when you need to make some changes
who will you love
in a world of constant strangers
i'll go with you

i'll stay behind

held the table for eleven games
nothing was easier than the first seven
i beat a woman with varicose veins.
she stopped to see herself in the mirror
fix her hair and hide heir veins
and she lost the game.
next day i went to the dentist
he pulled some teeth and i lost some blood
we'd like to thank you for the cards you sent us
my wives and i were all choked up.
i recall how caesar and cleo
made love in the milky way
they needed boats and armies to get there
i know there's a better way.
i saw the movie and i read the book
but when it happened to me
i sure was glad i had what it took
to get away.
gotta get away, gotta get away
gotta get away, gotta get away

no one knows the things that he knows.
no one knows, no one knows

i just can't accept the stares
i'm using too many covers
i'm warm now so i don't care.

brought home in boxes to a trumpet's sound

children
are lost in the sand, building roads with little hands
trying to join their father's castles together again
will they make it? who knows where or when
old wounds will mend?
machines
are winding their way along, looking strong
building roads and bringing back loads and loads
of building materials
in the night
men
are trying to move the borders on the ground
lines between the different spots that each has found
but back home another scene was going down
in the night.
lust
comes creepin' through the night to feed on hearts
of suburban wives who learned to pretend
when they met their dream's end

they've got to walk in their shoes
they've got to see what they see
they've got the people around them
getting too much for free
all the pimps and the dealers
all the food they can eat
all the screamers and squealers
when they walk down the street
yeah.
he's just a rich old man
he never cared for anyone
he likes to count his possessions
he's been a miser from penny one
he never cared for his children
never cared for his wife
never made anyone happy
that's the way he lived his life
and one day in the sunshine
he got a bolt from the blue
unloaded all of his possessions
sold his investments too
and now he lives with the homeless
owns 900 hospital beds
he prefers to remain nameless
it's publicity he dreads
yeah.
there's a judge in the city
he goes to work every day
spends his life in the courthouse
keeps his perspective that way
but i respect his decision
he's got a lot on his mind
he's pretty good with the gavel
a little heavy on the fines
one day there was this minstrel
who came to court on a charge
that he blew someone's head off
because his amp was too large
and the song he was singin'
was not for love but for cash
well, the judge waived the charges
he fingered his mustache
yeah.
well, there's a clown in a carnival
he rode a painted horse
he came from somewhere out west
he was very funny of course
but that is not what i noticed
it was the incredible force
with which he held his audience
while he rode on his horse
his jokes were not that off color
his smile was not that sincere
his show was that not that sensational
reasons for success were not clear
but he still made big money
one day the circus was his
now he's married to the acrobat
and they're training their kids
yeah.
now the jailhouse was empty
all the criminals were gone
the gate was left wide open
and a buck and fawn
were eating grass in the courtyard
when the warden walked in
and took a rifle from the prison guard
and said to him with a grin
to shoot those deer would be stupid, sir
we already got 'em right here
why not just lock the gates and keep them
with intimidation and fear?
but the warden pulled the trigger
and those deer hit the ground
he said nobody'll know the difference
and they both looked around.
yeah.
well, the cop made the showdown
he was sure he was right
he had all of the lowdown
from the bank heist last night
his best friend was a robber
and his wife was a thief
all the children were murderers
they couldn't get no relief
the bungalow was surrounded
when a voice loud and clear
come out with your hands up
or we're gonna blow you out of here
there was a face in the window
tv cameras rolled
and they cut to the announcer
and the story was told.
yeah.
well, the artist looked at the producer
the producer sat back
he said what we have got here
is a pretty good track
but we don't have a vocal
and we still don't have a song
if we could get this thing accomplished
nothin' else could go wrong
so he balanced the ashtray
and he picked up the phone
and said send me a songwriter
who's drifted far from home
and make sure that he's hungry
and make sure he's alone
and send me a cheeseburger
and a new rolling stone
yeah.
well, the sioux and dakota
they lost all of their land
and now a basketball player
is trying to lend them a hand
maybe someday he'll be president
he's quite a popular man
but now the chief has reservations
and the white man has plans
there's opposition in congress
the bill is up against cash
there's really no way of predicting
if it will fly or it will crash
but that's the nature of politics
that's the name of the game
that's how it looks in the tepee
big winds are blowing again
yeah.
there's still crime in the city
said the cop on the beat
i don't know if i can stop it
i feel like meat on the street
they paint my car like a target
i take my orders from fools
meanwhile some kid blows my head off
well, i play by their rules
so now i'm doing it my way
i took the law in my own hands
here i am in the alleyway
a wad of cash in my pants
i get paid by a ten year old
he says he looks up to me
there's still crime in the city
but it's good to be free
yeah.
now i come from a family
that has a broken home
sometimes i talk to my daddy
on the telephone
when he says that he loves me
i know that he does
but i wish i could see him
wish i knew where he was
but that's the way all my friends are
except maybe one or two
wish i could see him this weekend
wish i could walk in his shoes
but now i'm doin' my own thing
sometimes i'm good, then i'm bad
although my home has been broken
it's the best home i ever had
yeah.
well, i keep getting younger
my life's been funny that way
before i ever learned to talk
i forgot what to say
i sassed back to my mummy
i sassed back to my teacher
i got thrown out of sunday school
for throwin' bibles at the preacher
then i grew up to be a fireman
i put out every fire in town
put out everything smoking
but when i put the hose down
the judge sent me to prison
gave me life without parole
wish i never put the hose down
wish i never got old."

all you have is memories of happiness

you might wonder who can i turn to
on this cold and chilly night of gloom

is nowhere in this room.
all your dreams and your lovers won't protect you,
they're only passing through you in the end.
they'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to,
and wait for you to come back again.

who can't go back to war

"sun green started makin' waves
on the day that grandpa died
speakin' out against anything
unjust or packed with lies
she chained herself to a statue of an eagle
in the lobby of power co.
and started yelling through a megaphone,
""there's corruption on the highest floor.""
suits poured out of elevators
""you're all dirty.""
phoneheads began to speak
""you can't trust any of them.""
security couldn't get her down
she was welded to the eagle's beak.
sun green leaned into that megaphone, said,
""truth is all i seek.""
security brought in some blow torches
news cameras recorded her speech,
""when the city is plunged into darkness
by an unpredicted rolling blackout
the white house always blames the governor
saying the solution is to vote him out.""
on top of that great bronze eagle
sun's voice was loud and clear. she said,
""power co's working with the white house
to paralyze our state with fear.""
it was a golden moment
in the history of tv news
no one could believe it
it just got great reviews
""hey, mr. clean, you're dirty now, too.
hey, mr. clean, you're dirty now, too.
hey, mr. clean, you're dirty now, too.
hey, mr. clean, you're dirty now, too.""
the imitators were playing
down at jon lee's bar
when sun went down to see â€˜em
someone followed her in a car
now when she goes dancin'
she has to watch her back
the fbi just trashed her room
one of them kicked her cat
damn thing scratched his leg
so he had to shoot it dead
and leave it lyin' in a puddle of blood
at the foot of sun green's bed
jon lee's was rockin'
the imitators drove it home
sun was dancin' up a heat wave
for awhile she was all alone
when up walked a tall stranger
shadowed her move to move
in perfect unison
a supernatural groove
he took her by the hand
and the room began to spin
he said, ""i'm earth; earth brown.
you know the shape i'm in.
""i'm leavin' tonight for alaska
and i want you to come in the spring
and be a goddess in the planet wars
and save the living things.
""i'm ready to go right now,""
sun green told earth brown
""let's go back to my place,
pick up my cat, and leave this town behind.""
""hey, mr. clean, you're dirty now, too.
hey, mr. clean, you're dirty now, too.
hey, mr. clean, you're dirty now, too.
hey, mr. clean.""
next day sun green got busted for pot
and it made the headline news
but then the charges all got dropped
and the story gets confused
â€˜i'd still like to meet julia butterfly
and see what remedy brings
and be a goddess in the planet wars
try to save the living things
""but that might not be easy
livin' on the run
mother earth has many enemies

with an arrow through my nose
there was an indian in the corner
tryin' on my clothes.

with blankets on my bed.
i stayed there for a while

the coroner was friendly
and i liked him quite a lot.
if i hadn't 've been a woman

pulled over to the station

i thought that i was gonna scream.

things are different round here every night, my tears fall down like rain.
it's so hard for me now
but i'll make it somehow,
though i know i'll never be the same.
won't you ever change your ways,
it's so hard to make love pay
when you're on the losing end,"
"i caught you knockin' at my cellar door,
i love you baby can i have some more?
oh, the damage done.
i hit the city and i lost my band,
i watched the needle take another man.
gone, gone, the damage done.
i sing the song because i love the man,
i know that some of you don't understand.
milk blood to keep from runnin' out.
i've seen the needle and the damage done,
a little part of it in everyone,
but every junkie's like a settin' sun."
"they were playing that old country waltz
in this empty bar echoin' off the wall.
when i first got the bad news that you set me free,
the band played the old country waltz to me.
well, i loved, and i lost, and i cried
the day that the two of us died.
ain't got no excuses, i just want to ride
while the band plays the old country waltz.
out the window the moon shines
on the roofs of the cars
while i knock down tequila and salt
and the band plays the old country waltz.
and we're playin' it, that old country waltz
in this empty bar echoin' off the wall.
ain't got no excuses, we just want to play
that good old country waltz.
i ain't got no excuses, i just want to play
that good old country waltz.
that good old country waltz."
"up and down the old homestead
the naked rider gallops through his head
and although the moon isn't full
he still feels the pull.
out on the floor where the cowboys dance
approaching slowly at a glance
here comes the shadow of his stance
the reins are fallin' from his hands.
why do you ride that crazy horse?
inquires the shadow with little remorse
just then a priest comes down the stairs
with a sack of dreams and old nightmares.
who are you, the rider says
you dress in black but you talk like a fed
you spout ideas from books that you read
don't you care about this guy's head?
just then the sound of hoofbeats was heard
and the sky was darkened by a prehistoric bird
who flew between the unfulfilled moon
and the naked rider, to a telephone booth.
we'll call the moon and see what's up
i've got some change in this little tin cup
we'll say that the shadow is growin' dim
and we need some light to get back to him
just one call should do it all
i'll carve this number on the wall
with my beak.
flying feathers were all around
the air was filled with a ringing sound.
two more birds, the second and the third
came down from the sky to deliver the word.
where have you been, they said to the first
get back to the clouds, we're dying of thirst
there's not enough time to make that call
let's ditch this rider, shadow and all.
the sky was filled with the beautiful birds
still on the ground some crying was heard
with his dime in his hand and his hand on the dial
his ears were sweating as he forced a smile.
hoofbeats beating across the range
he rode through the night with his cup of change
tired and beaten he fell into slumber
but up in the sky they still had his number.
up and down the old homestead
the naked rider gallops through his head
and although the moon isn't full
he still feels the pull,
still feels the pull."
"don't call pretty peggy,
she can't hear you no more
don't leave no message
'round her back door.
they say the old laughing lady
been here before
she don't keep time,
she don't count score.
you can't have a cupboard
if there ain't no wall.
you got to move there's
no time left to stall.
they say the old laughing lady
dropped by to call
and when she leaves,
she leaves nothing at all.
see the drunkard of the village
falling on the street.
can't tell his ankles
from the rest of his feet.
he loves his old laughing lady
'cause her taste is so sweet.
but his laughing lady's loving
ain't the kind he can keep.
there's a fever on the freeway,
blacks out the night.
there's a slipping on the stairway,
just don't feel right
and there's a rumbling
in the bedroom
and a flashing of light
there's the old laughing lady,
everything is all right."
"the painter stood
before her work
she looked around every where
she saw the pictures and she painted them
she picked the colors from the air
green to green
red to red
yellow to yellow
in the light
black to black
when the evening comes
blue to blue
in the night
it's a long road
behind me
it's a long road
ahead
if you follow every dream
you might get lost
if you follow every dream
you might
get
lost.
she towed the line
she held her end up
she did the work of too many
but in the end
she fell down
before she got up again
i keep my friends eternally
we leave our tracks in the sound
some of them are with me now
some of them can't be found
it's a long road behind me
and i miss you now
if you follow every dream
you might get lost
if you follow every dream
you might
get
lost."
"you're still the child
suspended in space
crying out to you
beckons you to yet another fine place
where the trials of life are few
who says you are coming on
don't think you're living long
they won't remember you
the rent is always due.
the cloudy men
who take their place
and stand in line
they do
know not of
the satin face
that separates them from you
just put your blue jeans on
grab your guitar and write a song
don't think i'm kidding you
the rent is always due.
she rides a broom
with gold plated straw
and flutters around
and dies
the brylcream fools
just standing on
digesting all their lives

beneath her melting broom
the rent is always due."
"the people have heard the news

people are dying here and there
they don't see the world the way you do
there's no mission accomplished here
just death to thousands
a hundred voices from a hundred lands
cry out in unison
don't need no terror squad
don't want no damned jihad
blowin' themselves away in my hood

"one day a visitor took a trip through my town
we all were dancin' till he took his beat away
come to think of it, he thought of every last detail
slipped out late one night
completely out of sight
left his message etched into my brain.
and when the gates are closed on the road of plenty
the fist comes poundin' down you feel it everyday
it's hard to really know if you are full or empty
here it comes again
you think i'm your old friend
but now we're not so easily found.
me and my old corvette, we were flying through the night
chasin' my blonde lover down skyline
she saw the tail lights flash to avoid the crash
it was way too late
when i hit the brakes
and we went spinnin' with a screeching sound.
i was talkin' to my friend, tellin' him i lucked out
he smiled at me and said i'm glad you feel that way
and when i wrote that down on a piece of paper
beneath a garbage heap
down upon the street
a mariachi band began to play.
up in the gold hotel, the money hits the table
the heavies are all there, that's why the deal goes down
with beautiful women all dressed in diamonds and sable
down upon the street
beside a garbage heap
a mariachi band began to play.
in eldorado town there lives a great bullfighter
his eyes are screamin' blue, his hair is red as blood
and when the gate goes up, the crowd gets so excited
then he comes dancin' out
dressed in gold lami
he kills the bull and lives another day."

"in the lonely shack by the railroad track
i spent my younger days
and i guess the sound of the outward bound
made me a slave to my wanderin' ways.
and the wayward wind is a restless wind
a restless wind that yearns to wander
and i was born the next of kin
the next of kin to the wayward wind.
oh, i met him down in the border town
he vowed we'd never part
though he tried his best to settle down
now i'm all alone with a broken heart.
and the wayward wind is a restless wind
a restless wind that yearns to wander
and i was born the next of kin

if he were here
i'd long to hold him near

in the air for you.
we are leaving. we are gone.
come with us to all alone.
never worry. never moan.
we will leave you all alone.

"i'm waiting for the boys to bring the truck in
they should've been here by now

for the boys to come get the goods
it's loaded on the porch all ready to go
she wants to know where they are
looking for the headlights coming through the trees
i'm standing here waiting on the porch
they're coming down the highway, just made the turn
they called to let me know
she's asking me again and the smoke that i burn
keeps taking me to the old days
well, the jury is out on the old days, you know
the judgement is soon coming down
i can't quite remember what it was that i knew
i'm waiting on the headlights to come through the snow
the weather's changing, you know
they should've been here about an hour ago
she says that's what she thought
but i can't see 'em and that's all i know
i wonder if they might be lost"

think of me
i can spread my wings and fly just like them
and i can gallop across your open prairie
while i dive below your deepest sea
think of me
i'm gonna live long and i'm happy
to report it back to you
it's a window world and
i saw a sign on the highway too
as i flew over the wires
and observed you livin'
like you haven't had the chance to do
think of me
well, i've got to finish up
and get out of here right now
i can slither in the ditches
and cross below the roads
but when you cross your heart
and you hope to die
and your dreams come tumbling down
think of me
think of me
think of me
when you see those geese in the sky
think of me
i can spread my wings and fly just like them
i can gallop across your open prairie

just taking care of it now
it's been around for years and years
just waiting in its old case
it's been up and down the country roads
it's brought a tear and a smile

it cries when i leave it alone
silently it waits for me

empty pillow with perfume on
i smelled it.
well, we met in my favorite bar
took a ride in my old car
but i still don't know how
we made it home.
was i too far gone
too far gone
too far gone
for you.
we had drugs and we had booze
but we still had something to lose
and by dawn i wanted
to marry you.
with our attitudes by day
and our secret dreams by night
can we really live our lives
that way.
am i too far gone
too far gone
too far gone
for you.
was i too far gone
too far gone
too far gone
for you."
"too lonely, too lonely
too lonely to fall in love
too lonely, too lonely

good luck charm
i drive a fast car

too lonely to fall in love
too lonely, too lonely
too lonely to fall in love.
she's got the big lips
she's got the tight dress
working for a big tip
she don't go for less.
she's too lonely, too lonely
too lonely to fall in love
too lonely, too lonely
too lonely to fall in love.
she wears a fur coat
she's got a gold ring
comes from a good home
lookin' for a new thing.
she's too lonely, too lonely
too lonely to fall in love
too lonely, too lonely"
"out on the road the traffic slowed down to a crawl
strobe lights flashin' on the overpass
the tangled steel could not reveal what no one saw
or how he walked away without a scratch
he thought of her and walked along the exit ramp
he touched the night between two old street lamps.
and every one will touch the night
and every one will touch the night
and every one will touch the night.
imagine blue dissolve into the empty night
slowly fadin' no one answerin'
she walked away and left him standing all alone
between the shadows of his memory
and those who loved and lost will know the way it feels
to touch the night without the one you love.
and every one will touch the night
and every one will touch the night
and every one will touch the night."
"believe me,
when i tell you
that a love true
isn't hard to find.
'cause i found mine
and she's so fine
like a lifeline
from across the sea.
none of the neighbors
remember names,
they only see the faces
with destinations still unnamed.
it's hard to leave the traces
for someone to follow."
"train of love
racing from heart to heart
running late
still in the lonely part
this train will never run me down
but only take me where i'm bound
it's part of me and part of you
i'll always be a part of you
sail along, sail along silver moon
don't be blue
throw shadows in my room
i know in time we'll meet again
we come and go that way, my friend
it's part of me and part of you
i'll always be a part of you
""to love and honor 'til death do us part""
repeat after me
this train is never going back
when the lonesome whistle blows
no one knows, no one knows
train of love, train of love
train of love, train of love
it's part of me, it's part of you"
"trans am
the wagons in the valley had pulled up for the night
seth said ""go get the plow out merle, this place looks just right""
by then they were surrounded, by dawn they all were dead
i heard this from the old trans am, up the road ahead
that cowboy just kept talking, i thought i heard him say
he used to ride the santa fe before the tracks were laid
trans am
a nasty wind was blowing through the gates of eden park
one was swinging and one was hanging,
and the street lights all were dark
it crawled along the boulevard with two wheels on the grass
that old trans am was dying hard, but still had lots of gas
the golden gate was open wide, the sun came shining through
where once the angels stood and cried everything was new
trans am
global manufacturing, hands across the sea
the hotel filled with dealers, everything was free
before the competition, ahead of all the rest
the product was presented, it clearly was the best
the power link was ruptured, the hotel shook and rolled
the old trans am just bounced around and took another road
trans am
an old friend showed up at the door
the mile posts flying by
he said come on, i said what for
he said i'll show you why
i got a call from north of here
they said some girl's broke down
there's good money in it for you and me
if we can get her back to town
she's somewhere north of barstow
lost on 66
an old trans am by the side of the road
that needs a headlight fixed

"when we were living together
i thought that
i knew you would stay.
still when you left me
i tried to pretend
we could make it some way.
i don't care
if all of the mountains
turn to dust in the air.
it isn't fair that i should
wake up at dawn
and not find you there
it's hard enough losing
without the confusion
of knowing i tried.
but you've made your mind up
that i'll be alone
now there's nothing to hide.
i don't care
if all of the mountains
turn to dust in the air.
it isn't fair that i should
wake up at dawn

though my friends say don't look back
i can feel it coming through me
like an echo
like a photograph"
"was he thinkin' about my country
or the color of my skin?
was he thinkin' 'bout my religion
and the way i worshipped him?
did he create just me in his image
or every living thing?
when god made me
when god made me
was he planning only for believers
or for those who just have faith?
did he envision all the wars
that were fought in his name?
did he say there was only one way
to be close to him?
when god made me
when god made me
did he give me the gift of love
to say who i could choose?
when god made me
when god made me
when god made me
when god made me
did he give me the gift of voice
so some could silence me?
did he give me the gift of vision
not knowing what i might see?
did he give me the gift of compassion
to help my fellow man?

"when i hold you in my arms
it's a breath of fresh air
when i hold you in my arms
i forget what's out there
all those people with their faces
walkin' up the stree,
they don't have to say a thing
just look around and you see
new buildings going up,
old buildings coming down
new signs going up,
old signs coming down
you gotta hold onto something in this life
well the older generation
they got something to say
but they better say it fast
or get outta the way
all those gangsters with their crimes
they make it look so good
we've been blowing up the planet
just like the old neighbourhood
new buildings going up,
old buildings coming down,
new signs going up,
old signs coming down,
you gotta hold onto something in this life
if i only had a heart
it would beat all night for you
if i only had a heart
i would cry the whole day through

"when i watch you sleeping
there's nothing that you hide
when i smell you breathing
there's a sweetness from inside
and when i feel you stirring
and the day is about to break
outside wings are whirring
and the sky is there to take
i wonder how i got so close to you
and see the chances that you take
without thinking i'm going there too
these are the promises you make
when your eyes are blinded by love
and the history of fate
when i hear you purring
like a kitten and a lion
and i feel your softness
how you got it without trying
then you roll and tumble
with your dreams still holding on
and i hear that rumble
in the stomach of the dawn
today i paint my masterpiece
tonight i trace my tears
thinking through the road i took to you
and where i stumbled through the years
today i paint my masterpiece
tonight i trace my tears
thinking through my path to you
and where i stumbled through the years
that's when i knew i'd never hold you down
repeating old roads and fears
now the crows are calling
and the blackbirds sing in my ear
you got one eye open
and i'm smiling through my tears
but you'll never see them
here inside with my fears
in a place that's fading away
and taking on new years"
"selling papers on the corner,
i saw a man yesterday.
i asked him if he'd wanna
tell me what made him this way.
he said, when it's born, it's warm,
then it gathers strength in lies,
when it falls, it falls all over you.
he used to pick his friends.
they left him in the end.
an easy thing to lose,
the right to pick and choose.
when it's born, it's warm,
then it gathers strength in lies,
when it falls, it falls all over you.
he said he left his wife,
the back bone of his life.
another came along,
but now i guess she's gone.
when it's born, it's warm,
then it gathers strength in lies,
when it falls, it falls all over you.
i think i used to see
that old man on tv,
can you be the same?
it seems like such a shame.
when it's born, it's warm,
then it gathers strength in lies,
when it falls, it falls all over you.
the world he thought he knew,
has better things to do.
as i went on my way
i thought i heard him say:
when it's born, it's warm,
then it gathers strength in lies,
when it falls, it falls all over you."

gonna see a lot of people along the way

in the old days
running low on the people's fuel
riding in something that's really cool

she'd have a new place to go
she'd take me in her arms

never a tear could i find
just a haunting melody
comin' back to me

where are those old days and crazy nights?
now the house is all quiet and still
coyote house on the hill
how far did i go
before we said hello

that old white line is friend of mine
and it's good time we've been making
right now i'm rollin' down the open road
and the daylight will soon be breaking.
i was adrift on a river of pride
it seemed like such a long easy ride
you were my raft but i let you slide
i've been down but i'm coming back up again.

"it has often been my dream
to live with one who wasn't there
like an ocean fish who swam upstream
through nets, by hooks, and hungry bears.
when the water grew less deep
my fins were aching from the strain
i'm swimming in my sleep
i know i can't go back again.
got the will to love, the will to love.
i'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
never lose the will.
it's like something from up above.
i can be like a fire in the night
always warm and giving off light
but there comes a time when i shine too bright
oh, i'm just a fire in the night.
and now my fins are in the air
and my belly's scraping on the rocks
i still think someone really cares
and i'll keep swimming till i stop.
got the will to love, the will to love.
i'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
never lose the will.
it's like something from up above.
i'm like a singer on the stage
with the golden lights and liquid rage
down from the mountains to the sea
cool running love keeps cleansing me.
it keeps my gills from getting dry
but it distorts things in my eyes
sometimes i see what really isn't there
like my true lover, and i care.
got the will to love, the will to love.
i'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
never lose the will.
it's like something from up above.
sometimes i ramble on and on
and i repeat myself till all my friends are gone
and get lost in snow and drown in rain
and never feel the same again.
i remember the ocean from where i came
just one of millions all the same
but somewhere someone calls my name
i'm a harpoon dodger, and i can't, won't be tamed.
got the will to love, the will to love.
i'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
never lose the will.
it's like something from up above.
baby, if i see boredom in your eyes
i'll know my river has run dry
but i won't turn back with that lonely tide
i bought that ticket and i'll take that ride.
if we meet along the way
please sway beside me, let us sway together
our tails together and our fins and mind
we'll leave this water and let our scales shine
in the sun above and the sky below
so all the water and earth will know
it has often been my dream
to live with one who wasn't there."
"i waited for you, winterlong
you seem to be where i belong.
it's all illusion anyway.
if things should ever turn out wrong
and all the love we have is gone,
it won't be easy on that day.
waiting to follow
through the dreamlight of your way
is not so easy for me now.
half the time has passed away
things we thought of yesterday
come back now, come back now.

became fascinated with his own plans
turned you loose, your mama too
there wasn't a thing that you could do.
i got faith in you, it's the kind of love
that cuts clean through.
i got faith in you, it's a razor love
and it's true.
and you really made my day
with the little things you say
right now i'm looking through the window at a silhouette
trying to find something i can find yet
imagination is my best friend
got to watch out for the greedy hand, greedy hand
make a living like a rolling stone
on the road there's no place like home
silhouettes on the window.
who was it made your eyes flicker like that
tell me baby, where do get a man
i came to you with open arms

without rings
someone's hiding out
who can't forget about
the things that people do when they're free.
like visitors from space
it's hard to find a place
to blend in and go unrecognized.
i'm waiting for a sign
i'm standing on the road
with my mind outstretched to you.
i'm picking something up
i'm letting something go
like a dog i'm fetching this to you.
pictures in my mind
row of poppy fields
harmony entwined
a changing gear that grinds
pictures in my mind.
pictures in my brain
electrical energy
fighting drugs with pain
there's a war inside
pictures in my brain.
i'm looking for a job
i don't know what i'm doing
my software's not compatible with you.
but this i can't deny
i know that you can fly
cause i'm here on the ground without you.
angel without wings
owner without things
sharpshooter without rings ...around you.
the road we used to ride
together side by side
has flowers pushing through the dotted line."

big sky i'm grateful for your parting clouds
i know some hearts were broken
big crows still flying in your sky
herds of elk roam upon your meadows
and your eagle soars across my eyes
while you withstand the thoughtless plundering
wolf moon keep on shinin'
your days rolling by in timeless grace
your heart just keeps on beating
inside the beauty of this place
less fish swimmin' in your oceans
old ice floating in your seas
still you hold against the constant plundering
wolf moon
wolf moon thank you for risin'
big sky i'm grateful for your parting clouds
seeds of life your glowing fields of wheat
windy fields of barley at your feet
while you endure the thoughtless plundering"

"someone and someone were down by the pond
looking for something to plant in the lawn.
out in the fields they were turning the soil
i'm sitting here hoping this water will boil
when i look through the windows and out on the road
they're bringing me presents and saying hello.
singing words, words between the lines of age.
words, words between the lines of age.
if i was a junkman selling you cars,
washing your windows and shining your stars,
thinking your mind was my own in a dream
what would you wonder and how would it seem?
living in castles a bit at a time
the king started laughing and talking in rhyme.
singing words, words between the lines of age.
