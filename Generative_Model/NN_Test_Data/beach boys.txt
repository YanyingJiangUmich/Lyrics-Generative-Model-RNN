to waves and i both travel by
life supporting waves of bliss
mother divine's precious kiss
brings with love the light of wisdom
and the gift of eternal freedom
to waves and i both travel by
and that makes all the difference to me
all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
this is that
this is that
dusk time the shadows fall
into the timeless time of all
to waves and i both travel by
golden auras glow around you
omnipresent love surrounds you
wisdom warming as the sun
you and i are truly one
to waves and i both travel by
and that makes all the difference to me
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that
i am that, thou art that, all this is that

she was born in '32, and was she ever pretty
she rode a freight train west, all the way from detroit city
betsy's seen more places than i'll ever hope to see
betsy's been more loyal than any friend could be
with some she traveled fast, with others it was slow
betsy's seen them all, she'd seen them come and go
she must have had some others before i finally met her
and now that she's all mine, they'd better just forget her
betsy was a lady and that she will remain
betsy took some beatings but she never once complained
she had a classic beauty that everyone could see
i was the last to meet her, but she gave her life to me
she may be rusted iron, but to me she's solid gold
and i just can't hold the tears back
'cause betsy's growing old"

"well, along with our special feature of this beach boys' christmas album,
once again i'm happy to see the smiling face of the leader of
this popular group here in the studio, brian wilson.
good to see you again, brian.
hi, jack.
this beach boys' christmas album is really something.
ah, d*** reynolds did the arrangements, i guess, huh?
yes, he did. he did a beautiful job, a wonderful job.
is this the first time you've worked with him?
right. i'd been, uh, wanting to meet him and work with him for quite a long time.
now who's idea was it to have you featured on this, uh, one particular tune  i,
i was particularly impressed with it  ""a blue christmas.""
well, i... sort of picked out that song to sing for myself.
i, i love the song and uh, i've always wanted to sing it, so i thought i'd sing it.
well, maybe this will be the start of a whole new career, huh?
i don't know, that's... it, it could, and it couldn't. ah... i really don't know.
well, let's leave it to the listeners to see what they think of it.
right.
i notice this album has uh, ah, along with some of the popular things like, uh,
""i'll be home for christmas,"" uh, ""auld lang syne,"" and uh, um, ""we three kings""
and some of the traditional things, that you have a couple of your,
your own, uh, beach boys type sounds in the lp, too.
uh huh, we've more or less made one side, uh, our own style, and...
kind of a teen side and an adult side.
uh huh, right, um hm. contrasting.
uh huh. now, we have, uh, one of your originals coming up here, brian.
uh, ""christmas day."" you wrote this for the album specifically?
yes, i did. uh huh.
uh huh. and now, do you do your, the vocal arrangements,
or did d*** reynolds handle all of that?
d*** handled the vocal arrangements on the, ah, the modern side
  the traditional side  and i did the, ah, vocal and the
arrangements of the music on our own style  our basic style  side.
d*** did the strings, also, on the, uh, on the modern side.
coming up now, ah, a very sentimental type christmas song,
particularly for those who are away from home during this time of year
  ""i'll be home for christmas."" any, ah, thing particular about this,
this tune that you'd like to say, brian?
ah, well, i guess there's something very obvious when you hear the song.
it's, ah, there's a very definite influence of the four freshmen
on the arrangement as well as the delivery, and, uh, obviously
we all look up and admire the style of the four freshmen and,
uh, i feel this has been the greatest  one of the greater  
vocal influences, ah, in the world today.
well, it's certainly been, uh, nice of you to take the time to come
by again here for our special beach boys' christmas show.
you have a fine album here and, uh, i hope you'll be home for christmas.
well, i hope i will, too. i hope everyone's home for christmas.
i do, too. brian wilson, thanks again for coming by.
thank you very much, jack.
and here again, the beach boys' christmas album."

don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around
everybody tries it once
those who don't just have to put it down
you paddle out turn around and raise

you gotta catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world
not just a fad cause it's been going on so long
all the surfers going strong
they said it wouldn't last too long
they'll eat their words with a fork and spoon
and watch 'em they'll hit the road and all be surfin' soon
and when they catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world
catch a wave and your sittin' on top of the world
so take a lesson from a top notch surfer boy
every saturday boy
but don't treat it like a toy
just get away from the shady turf
and baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf
and when you catch a wave you'll be sittin on top of the world
catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world
catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world

i remember when rock was young
me and suzie had so much fun
holding hands and skimming stones
had an old gold chevy and a place of my own
but the biggest kick i ever got
was doing a thing called the crocodile rock
while the other kids were rocking round the clock
we were hopping and bopping to the crocodile rock
well crocodile rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can't keep still
i never knew me a better time and i guess i never will
oh lawdy mama those friday nights
when suzie wore her dresses tight
and the crocodile rocking was out of sight
crocodile rock, crocodile rock...
but the years went by and the rock just died
suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
long nights crying by the record machine
dreaming of my chevy and my old blue jeans
but they'll never kill the thrills we've got
burning up to the crocodile rock
learning fast as the weeks went past
we really thought the crocodile rock would last
well crocodile rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can't keep still
i never knew me a better time and i guess i never will

when suzie wore her dresses tight
and the crocodile rocking was out of sight

cuckoo, cuckoo cuckoo, cuckoo cuckoo, cuckoo cuckoo, cuckoo
i put that birdie away
his cuckoo was gone to stay
we both apologized for why
forgave that doggone cuckoo
i went back to her side
i had to swallow my pride
the fire had almost died away
we just got situated
cuckoo, cuckoo cuckoo, cuckoo cuckoo, cuckoo cuckoo, cuckoo
i took that clock apart
i broke the cuckoo's heart
he'll never bother us again
we just forgot about him

and the stardust sprinkles the morning
venus fades from my side
will my love be returning
like the sun to brighten up my life
and as day breaks over the ocean
moonlight still on the sea
i pray the waves gentle motion
will bring my babe to me
bring back
won't you bring back
bring back my baby

"santa claus is coming to town...
christmas is a joyous time of year.
but for an underprivileged child, this isn't always true.
this is dennis wilson of the beach boys.
alan, michael, carl, brian and myself would like to ask
all of you to join in with us in donating a toy to an
underprivileged children organization, so they, too,
might possibly share in a very, very happy christmas this year.
thank you."

whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

unbending never ending tablets of time
record all the yearning
unfearing all appearing message divine
eases the burning
whether willing witness waits at my mind
whether hope dampens memory
whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
feel flows feel goes 
encasing all embracing wreath of repose
engulfs all the senses
imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose
retire the fences
whether wholly heartened life fades away
whether harps heal the memory
whether wholly heartened life fades away

sun is shining, could we just find a way

frosty the snowman
is a fairy tale they say
he was made of snow
but the children know
how he came to life one day
there must have been some magic
in that old silk hat they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around
frosty the snowman
was alive as he could be
and the children say
he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me

knew the sun was hot that day
so he said, ""let's run
and we'll have some fun
now before i melt away""
down to the village
with a broomstick in his hand
running here and there
all around the square
saying, ""catch me if you can""
he led them down
the streets of town
right to the traffic cop
and he only paused a moment
when he heard them holler, ""stop!""
frosty the snowman
had to hurry on his way
but he waved goodbye
saying, ""don't you cry
i'll be back again some day"""

adventure on the high seas
put the childhood dream to the test
find the measure of the man

laughing at myself at what a crying shame
what ever happened to my greek godly frame

aren't always good as they seem
doughy lumps, stomach pumps, enemas too

you know you ought to take it slower,

think about the pain it can bring.
it makes you feel so bad.
it makes your heart feel sad.
it makes your days go wrong.
it makes your nights so long.

love is here
today
and its gone
tomorrow.
it's here
and gone so fast.
right now you think that she's perfection.
this time is really an exception.
well, you know i hate to be a downer,
but i'm the guy she left before you found her.
well, i'm not sayin'
you won't have a good love with her,
but i keep on rememberin'
things like they were.

from the spanish and indian home home of the heroes and villains.
once at night, catillian squared the fight,
and she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her
down.
but she's still dancing in the night, unafraid,
of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains.
heroes and villains, just see what you've done
heroes and villains, just see what you've done
stand or fall, i know there shall be peace in the valley,
and it's all an affair of my life with the heroes and villains.
in the cantina, margaritas keep the spirit high.
there i watched her, she spun around and wound in the warmth,
her body fanned the flame of the dance.
dance, margarita, don't you know that i'm in love with you
dance
you're under arrest!
my children were raised, you know they suddenly rise.
they started slow, long ago, head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and often wise.
at three score and five, i'm very much alive.
i've still got the jive to survive with the heroes and villains."

they come on like they're peaceful

the gardener walked out and the sprinklers went on
they watered the lawn and i went to sleep

again at the park on a nice summer day

a bird flew away and i went to sleep"

like a busy bee
i make up a song as i'm a working along
no one's watching me
i wish that you were here to help me dry
when's the last time you baked me a pie
you had a way of making it come alive

they gave me some breadcrumbs
and a little glass of water
and they're out there eating steak

"then the prince heard something he never knew could be
the hidden pied piper was laughing
as the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on
when the music died down the piper said that ""every night
after midnight if you leave your on your transistor radio
i'll promise to bring more magic music to you
no one"" he said "" will ever believe you so why tell of me to anyone?
you are my only friend of night"" said the pied piper ""and i'll talk to
you again some night""
then the radio was glowing no more
as it fell into the hands of the fascinated prince
he ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed
that night he dreamt all night
mostly about his radio and his friend the pied piper
the prince did try what the piper said to do
but for weeks at night
he heard nothing like the music of that magic night
""that pied piper must have been joking"" he said
""there's nothing but bach on this radio
i'm gonna throw it back up in the attic for good""
this he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud
that two of his brothers overheard him
the next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned
it on
there it was the music had to be from the pied piper himself
the prince's sisters ran in their brother's room
and they were all dancing and screaming with joy
but the transistor was playing too loud
and their mother heard it
""what are you doing there? what is that you're listening too?
give me that radio at once"" she said"
"i came along when he broke your heart
that's when you needed someone
to help forget about him
i gave you love with a brand new start
that's what you needed the most
to set your broken heart free
i know you cried, and you felt blue
but when i could i gave strength to you
i'm waiting for the day when you can love again
i kissed your lips
and when your face looked sad
it made me think about him
and that you still loved him so
but you know that pretty soon
i made you feel glad
that you belonged to me
and love began to show
he hurt you then, but that's all gone
i guess i'm saying you're the only one
i'm waiting for the day when you can love again
he hurt you then, but that's all done
i guess i'm saying you're the only one
i'm waiting for the day when you can love again
you didn't think that i could sit around and let him work
you didn't think that i could sit around and let  him take you
you didn't think that i could sit around and let him go
you didn't think that i could sit back and let you go

i make her happy just living so plain
in the back of my mind i'm 'fraid it's gonna change
i tried to run far way from thoughts
i should try to keep away
but they just keep coming back to me
i tried to rationalize
but some day i might realize
that things are just good the way they'll be
i know it's so hard to find
a girl who really understands your mind
what will i do if i leave her
it will always be way in the back of my mind"

met his glancing

so they could spend more
precious time near the water side

and it wasn't right
they were two ships
passing in the night

sometimes it's hard to find my way
sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days
when your friends have all gone
leaving this town for another one
the night is coming round
i can feel the weight of coming down,
so afraid to lose this dream
i want you to understand that i'm trying to do the best i can
it's so easy to lose my way
lay your head where you may find some peace
i've been searching for my happiness
don't you want to wake up and take my love,
i'd be happy if you'd let me know
should i stay or go
let me know
woke from a dream to see reflections all around me, of new realities,
heavenly angels won't you guide me please help me to decide the path most
meant for me."

looking quietly down at the path
a firefly flew in his room and flew right out again
down jumped the prince

as he made his way he could hear something once again

then from inside of it came a strange voice"

"it's been a long, long while
since we've been strung out on love
and there's no mask of a smile
that can hide what we're thinkin' of
from your heart i hear
only distant echoes of empty love
i guess this must be the matchpoint of our love
early in the game when you broke me
just like a serve we shoulda walked off the court
but we both didn't have the nerve so we volleyed a while with small talk
and a smile and as push comes to shove
i'd say this must be the matchpoint of our love
no one ever held me the way you did
no one could ever love me the way you did
how could love slip away from me?
in life's lonely game love too often
can let you down and tho' no one's to blame
love is stil the only game in town when it's love's last play you can only say by the stars above that this
must be the match point of our love

it was a graveyard smash
he did the mash
it caught on in a flash
the monster mash

"there was a mansion on a hill
but deep in a secret kingdom
where a young prince lived
he had four sisters and four brothers
the prince had a special bedroom on the ground floor
with a window that looked down into a deep deep forest
he could see distant lights from other castles in the kingdom
from his window
during the day
he went to school
when it became night
he stayed by himself
usually in his secret hidden bedroom
one night
while nearly everyone was asleep
he took out of the attic a radio
and he decided to listen to it"

hopin' just by chance that i'll get a glimpse of you
trying hard to find you somewhere up above
high on a mountain of love
the mountain of love, the mountain of love
you should be ashamed
you used to be a mountain of love
but you just changed your name
way down below there's a half a million people
somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
wedding bells are ringin' and they should've been ours
that's why i'm so handy, my dream is gone above

"a few days later the king and queen of the castle were
invited to a ball
as they were leaving that evening the queen said to
the young prince
who was the eldest of the children
""take care of the other ones tonight
and don't try to find that radio
we have it hidden away
we'll be home by midnight""
and then she said ""goodbye
the children's mother left
and the party had begun
and the children looked everywhere
high and low
checking to see if they could find that transistor
radio
they couldn't find it they couldn't find it
they looked upstairs and downstairs
all through the castle and finally
all of a sudden they heard a sound
what is that sound is it possible
could it be the pied piper himself
coming out of the magic transistor radio
or was it just the wind whistling by the castle window
no one knows if the mysterious pied piper of night
was the one who came back to visit the princes and
princesses again
but if you have a transistor radio and the lights are
all out some night
don't be very surprised if it turns to light green
and the whirling magic sound of the pied piper comes
to visit you"

school days
dear old golden rule days

the teacher is teachin' the golden rule
american history and practical math
studyin' hard and hopin' to pass
and workin' your fingers right down the bone
the guy behind you won't leave you alone
ring ring goes the bell
the cook in the lunchroom ready to sell
you're lucky if you can find a seat
you're fortunate if you have time to eat
back in the classroom open your books
the teacher don't know how mean she looks
ha ha ha ha ha
are you ready?
soon as three o'clock rolls around
you finally lay your burden down
throw down your books get out of your seat
and down the halls and into the street
up to the corner and 'round the bend
right to the juke joint you go in
drop the coin right into the slot
you gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
with the one you love you're makin' romance
and all day long you've been wantin' to dance
feelin' the music from head to toe
and round and round and round you go
hail hail rock and roll
deliver me from the days of old

the beat of the drums loud and bold

"late last night i got an s. o. s.
the fairy tale girl's in deep in distress
she says i don't know where i am
but it's near japan
my engine's all burned out
my crew has all bailed out
i don't know where i am
but it's somewhere near japan
and she said
""rescue me""
i'm somewhere in the
china sea
i think i'm sinkin' fast
this call is probably my last
i'm throwin' out a life line
and i'm doin' it for old time's sake
though i know you're gonna break my heart
one more time
late last night i got an s. o. s.
the fairy tale girl's in deep in distress
she says i don't know where i am
but it's near japan
my engine's all burned out
my crew has all bailed out
i don't know where i am
but it's somewhere near japan
and she said ""thank you dear""
i think she sounded quite sincere
and when she turned to go
she said ""i crave adventure don't you know""
and now she's driftin' on some chinese junk
her world is spinning and her hope has sunk
so i close my eyes
and somewhere near japan
the spinning stopped and the world stood still
i broke her fall and i always will
strung out in no man's land
somewhere near japan
rescue me"

"he used to ride the sidewalks in a landlocked town
a solitary surfer still he got around
he had his favorite spots now
where the best rides could be found
with posters on his wall from ""surfer"" magazine
his room looked like a shrine to the surfin' scene
go to hawaii out of high school was his big time college dream
did you ever wonder what happened to surfer joe
he up and took a ??? down to mexico
with a pretty senorita we both used to know
you can see him catch a wave in the mornin' light
and sometimes you can find him on his board at night
a silouette on water as the sun dips outta sight
he's still surfin'
he's still surfin'
you'll catch him on a wave on his way to class
then be back there after school 
he's still surfin'
he's still surfin'
surfers always love them summer days
with a board in the water rollin' with the waves
he's still surfin'
he's always been a surfer since the early days
spendin' the summer searchin' for that perfect wave
he and his surfin' senorita never seem to age
he doesn't do a whole lot with his law degree
they thought about a major oceanography
but he does a lot of thinkin' 'bout how to save the sea
things up north were gettin' kinda out of hand
so he got a break to see the ride on the sand
with his little mama seated in a surfer's never never land
you can see him catch a wave in the mornin' light
and sometimes you can find him on his board at night
a silouette on water as the sun dips outta sight
he's still surfin'
he's still surfin'
you'll catch him on a wave on his way to class
then be back there after school 
he's still surfin'
he's still surfin'
surfers always love them summer days
with a board in the water rollin' with the waves

they said the students scared the guard

and in their haste leave a trail of destruction
and toxic waste is leavin' no one safe

when you consider all the people
that are livin' in need
interdependence in this world is a natural fact
and we're all under attack
it's the eve of destruction or so they say
but mankind doesn't have to go that way
if we all get together we can make things right
and we can bring back summer
get us back our summer

like evryone from california to kokomo
we're gonna keep on rockin'

spending a sweet sunday lovin' you

just you and me, oh how nice that will be
all through the week i'll look back upon that
sweet sunday time
while looking forward to that special happiness
we'll find
when we awaken to hear from a songbird up above
sounds of a sweet sunday kinda love"

i know  i know that we can take it one more mile
because
we're singing that same song
we're still singing that same song
we're singing that same song
that same song
that same song
the rock of ages
built that rockin' sound
'til more and more people start to come around
they worshipped in church

i once had a dream
so i packed up and split for the city
i soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
i'm glad i went now i'm that much more sure that we're ready

" hi
trader
trader sailed a jeweled crown
humanity rowed the way
exploring to command more land
scheming how to rule the waves.
trader spied a virgin plain
and named it for velvet robes
wrote home declaring,
""there's a place
where totally folks are free
nourishment fills the prairies and the hillsides
and animals stalk the mountains and the seaside
and fish abound the lakes and birds the skies
signed sincerely.""
trader found the jeweled land
was occupied before he came
by humans of a second look
who couldn't even write their names shame
trader said they're not as good
as folks who wear velvet robes
wrote home again and asked, ""please help
their breasts i see; they're not like me
banish them from our prairies and our hillsides
clear them from our mountains and our seaside
i want them off our lakes so please reply
signed sincerely.""
trader he got the crown okay
cleared humanity from his way
he civilized all he saw
making changes every single day say
shops sprang over the prairies and the hillsides
then roads cut through the mountains to the seaside
the other kind fled to hide, by and by,
and so sincerely
cried.
making it softly
like the evening sea, trying to be
making it go
creating it gently
like a morning breeze, a life of ease
eyes that see
beyond tomorrow, through to the time without hours
passing the eden of flowers
reason to live.
embracing together
like the merging streams, crying dreams
making it full
begging intently
for a slight reprieve, a night of ease
hands to touch
beyond the sorrow, on to the force without power
piercing the crust of the tower
reason to live.
hoping
like a budding rose, humbling shows
making it.
struggling lonely
like a desert field, break the seal, make it real
ears to hear
beyond the showers, on to the suns of tomorrows
burning the flesh of all sorrows
reason to live.
reason to continue
reason to go on
reason to live
reason to live

"one by one the stars appear
the light of the day is no longer here
one by one the stars disappear
the sky grows brighter every minute of the sunrise
wake the world with a brand new morning
say hello to another fine morning
got my face in the running water
making my life so much brighter
moon shines bright, asleep in my bed
like so many people got a big day ahead of me
wake the world with a brand new morning
say hello to another fine morning
wouldn't miss it for all of its glory
i'll be there when you're calling me
one by one the stars appear
the light of the day is no longer here"
"we three kings of orient are
bearing gifts, we traverse far
field and fountain
moor and mountain
following yonder star
oh, star of wonder, star of might
star with royal beauty bright
westward leading
still proceeding
guide us to thy perfect light
born a babe on bethlehem's plain
gold we bring to crown him again
king forever, ceasing never
over us all to reign
oh, star of wonder, star of might
star with royal beauty bright
westward leading
still proceeding
guide us to the perfect light
frankincense to offer have i
incense owns a deity nigh
prayer and praising, all men raising
worship god on high
oh, star of wonder, star of might
star with royal beauty bright
westward leading
still proceeding
guide us to the perfect light"
"we know they're right when they say we're not ready
but all we care is how we feel right now
we'll go ahead just the same
prepare to take the blame
we'll run away and get married anyhow
they warned us that we can't live on love forever
but we just tell them we'll get by somehow
our problems will be greater
we'll worry 'bout them later
we'll run away and get married anyhow
if other kids went through it
then i know we can do it
if our love is that much stronger
it will last that much longer
it wasn't too long ago when our folks were
were going through the same thing we are now
but one thing they're forgetting
a thing they're not regretting
they ran away and got married anyhow
anyhow
they ran away and got married anyhow"
"wendy, wendy what went wrong
oh so wrong
we went together for so long
i never thought a guy could cry
'til you made it with another guy
oh wendy, wendy left me alone
hurt so bad
wendy, wendy don't lose your head
lose your head
wendy don't believe a word he says
i can't picture you with him
his future looks awful dim
oh wendy, wendy left me alone
hurt so bad
wendy i wouldn't hurt you like that
no no no
i thought we had our love down pat
guess i was wrong
the farthest thing from my mind
was the day that i'd wake up to find
my wendy
wendy left me alone
wendy, wendy left me alone
hurts so bad
wendy, wendy left me alone
hurts so bad
wendy, wendy left me alone
hurts so bad

"you know it makes you nervous
when you wait for you boy
you wait nine months for a bundle of joy
there's a baby
yes, there's a baby about to be born
and someday i'll put my son on my knee
and his little eyes will be looking at me
then i'll tell him
when a man needs a woman
they make things like you, my son
when a man needs a woman
they make things like you, my son
a man needs a woman
like a woman needs a man
when the two get together, oh oh oh
pretty soon we'll be a family of three
then it's not gonna be just you and me
we'll share all the goodies
with the one we bring in the world
when a man needs a woman
they make things like you, my son"
"when girls get together
they like to talk about their latest love
and their description seems somehow to fit just like a glove
when girls get together
they don't waste time on things llike weather and stuff
they all just play around and never seem to discuss it enough
this must have been going on prehistory
they may not ever solve the mystery
but they'll go talk until eternity
when girls get together
and bring up father or brother or men of their lives
it means so much if she's your sister or your mother or your lovin' wife
i guess we guys might never really know
how good we've got it but we'd like to show
just how much that we love them so
one bright springtime morning
i over heard an elderly lady's voice
as i walked by her bench she told her friends of her great loss
after they'd gone away
three little girls came skipping through the park
talking of little boys and getting home before it's dark
when girls get together"
"when i grow up to be a man
will i dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
will i look back and say that i wish i hadn't done what i did?
will i joke around and still dig those sounds
when i grow up to be a man?
will i look for the same things in a woman that i dig in a girl?
will i settle down fast or will i first wanna travel the world?
now i'm young and free, but how will it be
when i grow up to be a man?
oooooo ooooooo oooooooo
will my kids be proud or think their old man is really a square?
when they're out having fun yeah, will i still wanna have my share?
will i love my wife for the rest of my life
when i grow up to be a man?
what will i be when i grow up to be a man?
won't last forever
it's kind of sad
won't last forever
it's kind of sad
won't last forever"
"i've spent my whole life drifting
towards an elusive sun
i would have wandered forever
if your breeze hadn't come
and you just could be my anchor
you are my northern star
that navigates me home
don't need to search no more exotic islands
no that i found you're right where i belong
never been so much at home as i am
loving you is right where i belong
in my mind we're together
even when i'm alone
my heart leaves you never
never will our love grow old
my destination forever
you are my shining star that navigates me home
don't need to search no more exotic islands
now that i found you're right where i belong
never been as much at home as i am
loving you is right where i belong
don't need to search no more exotic islands
now that i found you're right where i belong
never been as much at home as i am
loving you is right where i belong"

mama i'm tellin' you as sure as i'm standing here
she's my girl and that's the way i'm keeping it now mama dear
no good will it do you to stand there and frown at me

wild honey she's mine"
"hanging down from my window
those are my wind chimes
on the warm breeze the little bells
tinkle like wind chimes
though it's hard i try not to look at my wind chimes
now and then a tear rolls off my cheek
close your eyes and lean back now listen to wind chimes
in the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes
though it's hard i try not to look at my wind chimes"
"winds of change blow 'round my door
is this the year i've been waiting for?
worlds in motion endlessly
cosmic ocean flows into my heart
part of me would like to be a shining lighthouse for all to see when the dark night hides the sun
shine a light for everyone to see
isn't that the way it should be?
i am no stranger to a world of change
there are always situations to rearrange
but there's something special 'bout this quiet dawn
it seems to sing a song to everyone
it's dawning on and on and on
of change are here at last the clouds have lifted, the storm has passed nights we've known are on the run
and there's a bright and shining sun
for everyone to see
winds of change"
"autumn colors have gone
birds fled south with their song
snowflakes cover the earth quietly
night extends through the hours
coolly lit by the stars
the pulse of life slows silently
cuddle up in a cozy nook
with a warm drink and a book
within a winter symphony
somewhere children outside
screamin' down a daredevil slide
rosy cheeked bundles of cold weather clothes
hear the winter winds howl
pierced by the hoot of an owl
fingers of frost take a nip at my nose
cuddle up in a cozy nook
with a warm drink and a book
within a winter symphony
winter symphony
snowflake fantasy
warms my heart like a tropic sea
there the sun always shines
there you'll always be mine
all in a winter symphony
winter symphony
snowflake fantasy
warms my heart like a tropic sea
there the sun always shines
there you'll always be mine
all in a winter symphony"

"wouldn't it be nice if we were older
then we wouldn't have to wait so long
and wouldn't it be nice to live together
in the kind of world where we belong
you know it's gonna make it that much better
when we can say good night and stay together
wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
in the morning when the day is new
and after having spent the day together
hold each other close the whole night through
happy times together we've been spending
i wish that every kiss was never ending
wouldn't it be nice
maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray
it might come true
baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
we could be married
and then we'd be happy
wouldn't it be nice
you know it seems the more we talk about it
it only makes it worse to live without it
but let's talk about it
wouldn't it be nice"

i need a mess of help to stand alone
i need a spark by a fire
to stop the cold of my winter
i need a burst of your raindrops
to keep a flow in my river
i need a call for my phone will ring
i need your song for my voice will sing
please realize
i'm not half alive
without a mess of help to stand alone
i need the warmth of your smile
to heat my frostbitten sorrow
i need your hand on my shoulder
to lead todays to tomorrows
i need your strength to lock me to the track
i need your trust to bust the things i lack
belief i cried

i try hard to be more what you want me to be
