"and now the end is near,
and so i face the final curtain.
my friend, i'll say it clear,
i'll state my case, of which i'm certain.
i've lived a life that's full,
i travelled each and every highway.
and more, much more than this,
i did it my way.
regrets i've had a few,
but then again too few to mention.
i did what i had to do,
and saw it through without exemption.
i planned each chartered course,
each careful step along the by way.
and more, much more than this,
i did it my way.
yes,
there were times,
i'm sure you knew,
when i bit off more than i could chew.
but through it all, when there was doubt,
i ate it up, and spit it out.
i faced it all, and i stood tall,
and did it my way.
i've loved, i've laughed, and cried,
i've had my fill, my share of losing.
and now, as tears subside,
i find it all so amusing.
to think i did all that,
and may i say, not in a shy way.
oh no, oh no, not me
i did it my way.
for what is a man, what has he got,
if not himself, then he has not
to say the things he truly feels,
and not the words of one who kneels.
the record shows,
i took the blows
and did it my way.
yes, it was my way."

the days of wine and roses and you

something in your smile was so exciting,
something in my heart,

strangers in the night
two lonely people we were strangers in the night
up to the moment
when we said our first hello.
little did we know
love was just a glance away,
a warm embracing dance away, and
ever since that night we've been together.
lovers at first sight, in love forever.
it turned out so right,

let me try again
think of all we had before
let me try once more

to try to go it all alone
there's no sense to life without you

that i've got you under my skin

for the sake of having you near
in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
and repeats repeats in my ear
don't you know you fool, you never can win
use your mentality, wake up to reality
but each time i do, just the thought of you
makes me stop before i begin
because i've got you under my skin

"you must remember this
a kiss is still a kiss
a sigh is still  a sigh
the fundamental things apply
as time goes by
and when two lovers woo
they still say: ""i love you""
on that you can rely
no matter what the future brings
as time goes by
moonlight and love songs
never out of date
hearts full of passion
jealousy and hate
woman needs man
and man must have his mate
that no one can deny
it's still the same old story
a fight for love and glory
a case of do or die
the world will always welcome lovers
as time goes by"

"when they begin the beguine
it brings back the sound of music so tender,
it brings back a night of tropical splendor,
it brings back a memory evergreen.
i'm with you once more under the stars,
and down by the shore an orchestra's playing
and even the palms seem to be swaying
when they begin the beguine.
to live it again is past all endeavor,
except when that tune clutches my heart,
and there we are, swearing to love forever,
and promising never, never to part.
what moments divine, what rapture serene,
till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
and now when i hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
i know but too well what they mean;
so don't let them begin the beguine
let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
let it sleep like the dead desire i only remember
when they begin the beguine.
oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play,
till the stars that were there before return above you,
till you whisper to me once more, ""darling, i love you!""
and we suddenly know what heaven we're in,
when they begin the beguine"

a time for gifts and giving

i think about my living
the christmas time when i was young,
the magic and the wonder,
but colors dull and candles dim,
and dark my standing under
o little zachary, shining light
you've set my soul to dreaming
you've given back my joy in life
and filled me with new meaning
a savior king was born that day,
a baby just like you,
and as the magi came with gifts,
i come with my gift too
that peace on earth fills up your time,
that brotherhood surrounds you.
that you may know the warmth of love,
and wrap it all around you
it's just a wish, a dream i'm told
from days when i was young
merry christmas, little zachary
merry christmas, everyone
merry christmas, little zachary
merry christmas, everyone"

the lawn we were proud of is waving in hay
a beautiful garden has withered away
where you planted roses, the weeds seem to say
a cottage for sale
from every single window, i see your face
but when i reach the window, there's empty space
the key's in the mailbox, the same as before
but no one is waiting for me anymore

i haven't got a chance

you're calmer than the seals
in the arctic ocean

with no insults and all morals

in your blue serge pants
i never get the chance

the british museum,

but the age of miracles,
it hadn't past
and suddenly,
i saw you standing right there

close to a little leafy lane
a touch of color   'neath skies of gray

surely here i was charmed beyond compare   to view
maybe it was just that i was there   with you

and all you gals, you gotta pay some mind,
when you find a guy  worth keeping, be satisfied,
make sure you treat him very kind..

you could always get the other kind.
messing around with another guy.
then you rave and you'll even start to crave,
man, you want to see her lying deep down in the grave.
so if the guy's nice, you better take my advice,
you better love him in the morning, kiss him every night,
ooo, give him plenty of loving, treat him right,
because a good man nowadays is hard to find.
baby, don't you go away, i'm coming right home.
well, i went back, but i told this doll,
i said: woman, then is then, but now is now,
if you want me to stay, there's just one but keep a smile on your face, and keep your big mouth shut.
well, we're back together, and everything is fine,
i better love you in the am , kiss you in the pm give plenty of loving  with all my mind  yes, ma'am!

but this might be i discover i'm for you.
and just as sure as it's more than fooling.
it's quite a lot more than just a little in love."

this is a lovely way to spend an evening. can't think of anything i'd rather do
this is a lovely way to spend an evening, can't think of anyone as lovely as you
a casual stroll through a garden. a kiss by a lazy lagoon
catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune

i want to save all my nights and spend them with you

"yesterday we were g**,
i was high on a rainbow, but now there's no rainbow,
you've gone, and so a lover is blue.
life was sweet, so complete,
now i've suddenly waken to find i'm forsaken,
alone, and so a lover is blue.
do you still remember our love affair,
does it matter to you,
but i'll have to go through our door to care.
here and there everywhere,
every scene just reminds me
of something that binds me
to you, and so a lover is blue."
"in me you see a man alone
held by the habit of being on his own
a man who listens to the trembling of the trees
with sentimentals ease
in me you see a man alone
behind the wall he's learned to call his home
a man who still goes walking in the rain
expecting love again.
a man not lonely
except when the dark comes on
a man learning to live with
memories of midnights
that fell apart at dawn
in me you see a man alone
drinking up sundays and spending them alone
a man who knows love is seldom what it seems
only other people's dreams.
a man learning to live with
memories of midnights
that fell apart at dawn
in me you see a man alone
drinking up sundays and spending them alone
a man who knows love is seldom what it seems
just other people's dreams."
"stars in the sky were dancing
one night perfect for romancing,
the night a sinner kissed an angel,
he wanted thrills, she wanted love,
oh but his sighs were tender
as he begged her to surrender,
the night a sinner kissed an angel,
and she believed that it was love.
how was she to know that every lovely vow
was part of the game he was playing,
but to his surprise he realized
somehow he meant every word he was saying.
yes, miracles can happen,
i know 'cause i saw what happened
that night a sinner kissed an angel,
that was the night i fell in love."
"there's a tree in the meadow
with a stream drifting by
and carved upon that tree i see
""i love you till i die""
i will always remember
the love in your eye
the day you carved upon that tree
""i love you till i die""
but further on down lovers' lane
a silhouette i see
i know you're kissing someone else
i wish that it were me
by that tree in the meadow
my thoughts always lie
and wherever you go, you'll always know
i love you till i die"

"ev'ry morning mem'ries stray,
across the sea where flying fishes play,
and as the night is falling
i find that i'm recalling
that blissful all enthralling day
just before i sailed away,
she said the word i longed to hear her say,
i tenderly caressed her
close to my heart i pressed her
upon that golden yesterday.
i found my love in avalon beside the bay,
i left my love in avalon and sailed away.
i dream of her and avalon, from dusk till dawn
and so i think i'll travel on
to avalon."

will be
pacing the floor
listen
to that fireplace
roar
so really
i'd better scurry

please don't hurry
well, maybe
just a half
a drink more
put some records on
while i pour
and the neighbors
might think
baby
it's bad out there
say
what's in this drink?
no cabs
to be had out there
i wish i knew how
your eyes
are like starlight now
to break the spell
i'll take your hat
your hair looks swell
i ought to say
no, no, no sir
mind if i
mmove in closer?
at least i'm gonna say
that i tried
what's the sense of
hurtin' my pride?
i really can't stay
baby don't hold out
baby
but it's cold outside
i simply must go
but baby
it's cold outside
the answer is no
i say
it's cold out there
the welcome
has been how lucky
that you dropped in
so nice and warm
look out that window
man that's hard
my sister
will be suspicious
gosh
your lips look delicious
my brother
will be there at the door
waves upon a tropical
shore
my maiden
aunt's mind is vicious
gosh
your lips are delicious
well maybe
just a cigarette more
oh
never such a blizzard
before
i've got to go home
baby
you'll freeze out there
say, lend me your coat
it's up
to your knees out there
you've really been grand
i thrill
when you touch my hand
but don't you see
how can you do
this thing to me
there's bound
to be talk tomorrow
think
of my lifelong sorrow
at least there
will be plenty implied
if you caught pneumonia
and died
i really can't stay
get over that old lie
oh
but it's cold outside"

were searching for a different tune
one that they could croon
as only they can
they only had the rhythm
so they started swaying to and fro
they didn't know just what to use
that is how the blues really began
they heard the breeze in the trees
singing weird melodies
and they made that the start of the blues
and from a jail came the wail
of a down hearted frail
and they played that
as part of the blues
from a whippoorwill
out on a hill
they took a new note
pushed it through a horn
'til it was worn
into a blue note
and then they nursed it, rehearsed it
and gave out the news
that the southland gave birth to the blues!"

that old black magic that you weave so well
those icy fingers up and down my spine,

the same old tingle that i feel inside

down and down i go,
round and round i go,
like a leaf that's caught in the tide.
i should stay away but what can i do,
i hear your name, and i'm aflame,
a flame with such a burning desire,
that only your kiss can put out the fire.
'cause you're the lover i have waited for,
the mate that fate had me created for,
and every time you lips meet mine,
darling, down and down i go,
round and round i go,
in that spin of love that i am in,
under that old black of love."

then you became the bored one,
and i was like a toy that brought you joy one day,
a broken toy that you preferred to throw away.

blame it on my youth.
if only just for you i did exist,
blame it on my youth.
i believed in everything,
like a child of three.
you meant more than anything,
all the world to me.
if you were on my mind both night and day,
blame it on my youth.
if i forgot to eat and sleep and pray,
blame it on my youth.
and if i cried a little bit when first i learned the truth,
don't blame it on my heart,
blame it on my youth."

daybreak, we talked till daybreak
without a warning of what might come after.

it's the call of the canyon, bringing back your answer to me."

of all the children who now have children of their own
funny, but comes december, and i remember every christmas i've known."

it tells the native population that civilization is fine.

they swim and they fish, but that's what i do all year round.

'cause they've got to fill that quota
and the way things are i'll bet they never will
they've got a zillion tons of coffee in brazil

and was fined a great big fifty dollar bill

you date a girl and find out later
she smells just like a percolator
her perfume was made right on the grill
why they could percolate the ocean in brazil
and when their ham and eggs need savor
coffee ketchup gives 'em flavor
coffee pickles way outsell the dill
why they put coffee in the coffee in brazil

crazy dreams, keep me clinging to this affair.
i'm insane to keep dreaming that you could care.
but i am a kind of a fool who stayed after school.
i've learned my lessons well,
and if this crazy love is such a crazy love, i'm glad i fell."

and to my greatest joy, my love is there
she dances overhead
on the ceiling near my bed

the smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
the walls of my room fade away in the blue,
and i'm deep in a dream of you.
the smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
you come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
for we love anew just as we used to do
when i'm deep in a dream of you.
then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing;
we glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
that i'm soon revealing my love for you over again.
my cigarette burns me, i wake with a start;
my hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart.
awake or asleep, ev'ry mem'ry i'll keep
deep in a dream of you."

deep night, stars in the sky above
moonlight, lighting our place of love
night winds seem to have gone to rest
two eyes, brightly with love are gleaming
come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
vow that you'll love me always, be mine alone
deep night, whispering trees above
kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
deep night, deep in the arms of love

and the stars begin to flicker in the sky,
through the mist of a memory, you wander back to me,
breathing my name with a sigh.

though you're gone, your love lives on
when moonlight beams.
and as long as my heart will beat, lover, we'll always meet,
here in my deep purple dreams."
"when i try to sing you say i'm off key
why can't you see how much this hurts me
with your perfect beauty and your perfect pitch
you're a perfect terror
when i come around must you always put me down?

you will hurt my feelings don't you see my love
i wish i had an ear like yours
a voice that would behave
but all i have is feelings and a voice gone deaf
you insist my music goes against the rules
but rules were never meant for lovesick fools
i wrote this little song for you but you don't care
its a crooked song oh but all my love is there
the thing that you would see if you would play your part
is even if i'm out of tune i have a gentle heart
i took your picture with my trusty rollaflex
and now all i have developed is a complex
possibly in vain i hope you weaken oh my love
and forget these rigid rules that undermine my dream of
a life of love and music with someone who'll understand
that even though i may be out of tune
when i attempt to say how much i love you
all that matters is the message that i bring
which is my dear one i love you"

transcriber's notes is an intentional mispronunciation of the word ""communique"". also,
a ""d***"" was slang for a detective or private eye. per the dictionary, ""dead eye"" means an
expert marksman. a dead eyed d***  in the context of the song
refers to someone ""aiming at"" or ""with his sights on"" someone...but like the doctor, lawyer, etc.,

you've been my near ones, always my dear ones
i never thought that i would find
another love, a different kind
but it came to be
well if you think i'm telling you lies
go try your luck and look into her eyes
but remember, you must remember she's mine
and my world overhead has a clear new shine
don't want to leave you
sorry to grieve you
it's traveling time, and i must move on
found the girl  to lean upon
and if i could arrange it
oh would i care to chance it   not me"
"don't make me beg for your kisses,
beg for your tender embrace,
i want your love, not your sympathy,
please don't make a beggar of me.
since i looked in your direction,
your tenderness is all i seem to crave.
but when i look for your affection,
you smile, my dear, and tell me to behave.
don't make me beg for your kisses,
beg for your tender embrace,
i want your love, not your sympathy,
please don't make a beggar of me.
while i sigh and keep confessing,
the love i have for you will never die,
somehow you always keep me guessing,
and wond'ring just how long i'll have to cry.
don't make me beg for your kisses,
beg for your tender embrace.
i want your love, not your sympathy,
please don't make a beggar of me."
"you wander around on your own little cloud
when you don't see the why or the wherefore
you walk out on me when we both disagree
'cause to reason is not what you care for
i've heard it all a million times before
take off your coat, my love, and close the door
don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain
don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long
forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong
now you're beside me again
you try to be smart, then you take it to heart
'cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
you don't realize that it's all compromise
and the problems are so overrated
goodbye means nothing when it's all for show
so why pretend you've somewhere else to go
don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain
don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long
forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong
now you're beside me again

and the sky feels blue
tear a petal from a rose

and mine will surely break

so please keep the spark awake
would you take the wings from birds
so that they can't fly
would you take the ocean's roar
and leave just a sigh
all this your heart won't let you do
this is what i beg of you
don't take your love from me"

while mine's nearly sung

winter is near and the leaves
start tumblin' down
why must the moments go by in such haste
don't wait too long
winter is coming i've no time to waste
don't wait too long"
"don't worry 'bout me
i'll get along
just you forget about me
be happy my love
just say that our little show is over
and so the story ends
why not call it a day, the sensible way
and we'll remain friends
look out for yourself
should be the rule
just give your heart and your love, to whom ever you love
don't you be a fool
baby why stop and cling, to some fading thing
that used to be
so if you can't forget
don't you worry 'bout me"
"when you're alone and life is making you lonely
you can always go   downtown
when you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry

how can you lose?
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown, things'll be great when you're
downtown   no finer place, for sure
downtown   everything's waiting for you
don't hang around and let your problems surround you
there are movie shows   downtown
maybe you know some little places to go to
where they never close   downtown
just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
you'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
happy again
the lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown, where all the lights are bright
downtown   waiting for you tonight
downtown   you're gonna be all right now
and you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
guide them along
so maybe i'll see you there
we can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
so go downtown, things'll be great when you're

"dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
or the years and the tears shed might claim you.
for the last time we have tasted
love's sweet tears by the fire's glow.
if our hearts are strong there'll be
no long good byes when it's time to go.
but the strongest torch is sometimes broken
as the deepest vows aren't always spoken,
and the greatest wounds, we hide inside ourselves
where they never show.
dream away, child, let your dreams run wild.
or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
or the years and the tears shed might claim you.
when the winter weds the northern wind
the child they bear is snow.
and the branches bow like worried bridesmaids
but the trees will grow.
sun and earth in time will come together,
god will give us back our summer weather,
but the mem'ries of that first sweet
taste of love pass away so slow.
dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
or the years and the tears shed might claim you.
when there's no room left to live inside ourselves
do we dream away."

if you can't recall the singer, you can still recall the tune.
dry your eyes and play it slowly, like you're marching off to war,

but we came to find the secret and we never let it go.

through the lightning and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon,
to that distant calling angel who descended much too soon.

ev'rything happens to me.
i never miss a thing  
i've had measles and the mumps.
and ev'ry time i play my ace  
my partner always trumps.
i guess i'm just a fool;
who never looks before he jumps,
ev'rything happens to me.
at first my heart tho't;
you could break this jinx for me.
that love would turn the trick;
to end my despair.
but now, i just can't fool;
this head that thinks for me.
i've mortgaged all my castles in the air.
i've telegraphed and called;
i sent ""air mail special"", too;
you answer was goodbye  
and there was even postage due.
i fell in love just once;
and then it had to be with you,
ev'rything happens to me."

starry night, this is the fable of the rose,
the rose i gave my love,
beyond all dreams of her caress,
i may as well confess,
she only loved me slightly nonetheless
yet her smile so strangely taunts me
all the thrill of it haunts me,
and so it goes, the fable of the rose."

unable to see

or forgiving when i walk along some railroad track and find
that you are moving on the backroads

i dip my cup of soup back from the gurglin'
cracklin' caldron in some train yard
my beard a roughning coal pile and
a dirty hat pulled low across my face

look at yourself, if you had a sense of humor
you would laugh to beat the band
look at yourself, do you still believe the rumor
that romance is simply grand?
since you took it right on the chin
you have lost that bright toothpaste grin
my mental state is all a jumble
i sit around and sadly mumble
fools rush in, so here i am
very glad to be unhappy
i can't win, but here i am
more than glad to be unhappy
unrequited love's a bore
and i've got it pretty bad
but for someone you adore
it's a pleasure to be sad
like a straying baby lamb
with no mammy and no pappy
i'm so unhappy
but oh, so glad!"

i see you each morning, but you just walk by me

it's a cinch that the bum is under the thumb of some little broad

the sweet ring of truth and understanding
when the words ""i love you"" reach my ear
don't mind these lines beneath my eyes, they're well earned souvenirs
of a thousand nights of laughter and occasional tears
and i hope you won't be jealous of the silver in my hair
it took many lover's quarrels to put it there
how old am i?, you kiss me and i'm young
love's a road never traveled, life's a song i've never sung
if i make you happy today, i'm the perfect age
as for tomorrow turn the page"

hey don't save your kisses   just pass 'em around
you'll find my reason   is logically sound
who's gonna know that you past them around
a hundred years from today
and why crave a penthouse   that's fit for a queen
you're nearer heaven   on mamma earth's green
if you had millions   what would they all me
one hundred years from today
so  laugh and sing   make love the thing
be happy while you may
 there's always one   beneath the sun
who's bound to make you feel that way
the moon is shining   and that's a  good sign
cling to me closer   say  you'll be mine
remember baby we won't see it shine

on your smile, so sweet, so tender
when at first my kiss you do decline
on the light in your eyes when you surrender
and once again our arms intertwine
and so when wise men say to me
that love's young dream never comes true
to prove that even the wise men can be wrong
i concentrate on you

the unreal from the real thing is hard to know
i discovered somebody who
could be truly worthy and true
yes, i met my ideal thing when i met you
i see your face before me
crowding my every dream
there is your face before me
you are my only theme
it doesn't matter where you are
i can see how fair you are
i close my eyes and there you are
always
if you could share the magic
yes, if you could see me too
there would be nothing tragic
in all my dreams of you
would that my love could haunt you so
knowing i want you so
i can't erase your beautiful face before me"

i have loved and i have learned
and as far as i'm concerned
i should care
i should go around weeping
i should care
i should go without sleeping
strangely enough i sleep well
'cept for a dream or two
but, then, i count my sheep well
funny how sheep can tell you to sleep, so
i should care
i should let it upset me
i should care
but it just doesn't get me
maybe i should find
someone as lovely as you
but i should care

"in the hush of evening
as shadows steal across my lonely room
i think of you
i think of you
from afar the music
of violins come softly through the gloom
all i can do
is think of you
o i can see you standing there before me
and i can hear you whisper
you adore me
so when dusk is falling
i live again the loveliness we knew
i think of you
i think of you"
"i took a trip on a train
and i thought about you
i passed a shadowy lane
and i thought about you
two or three cars arked under the stars
a winding stream
moon shining down on some little town
and with each beam, the same old dream
and every stop that we made, oh, i thought about you
when i pulled down the shade then i really felt blue
i peeked through the crack, looked at the track
the one going back to you
and what did i do? i thought about you"
"i tried,
tried to impress you,
my love,
i gave it all
each hour ever at your beck and call.
i tried,
tried to caress you,
my soul,
filled with desire,
two arms craving the one i admire.
your charm was so appealing,
i loved you from the start,
there's still that same old feeling,
concealed here in my heart.
i tried making you love me,
and you couldn't decide,
but i'll never regret that i tried,
and tried and tried."

the sleepless nights   the daily fights
the quick toboggan   when you reach the heights
i miss the kisses   and i miss the bites
i wish i were in love again
the broken dates   the endless waits
the lovely loving   and the hateful hates
the conversation   with the flying plates
i wish i were in love again
no more pain   no more strain
now i'm sane   but i would rather be punched   drunk
the pulled out fur   of cat and cur
the fine mismating   of a him and her
i've learned my lesson   but i wish i were
in love again
the furtive sigh   the blackened eye
the words: ""i love you   'til the day i day""
the self deception   that believes the lie
i wish i were in love again
when love congeals   it soon reveals
the faint aroma   of performing seals
the double crossing   of a pair of heals
i wish i were in love again
no, no more care   no, no despair
now i'm all there    but i'd rather be puncdrunk
believe me sir   i much prefer
the classic battle   of a him and her
i don't like quiet   and i wish i were
in love again   in love again   in love again"

and then a kiss, but more than this, i wish you love.
and in july a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade,
i wish you health, and more than wealth, i wish you love.
my breaking heart and i agree that you and i could never be,
so with my best, my very best, i set you free.

i hope i never waken,
it's more than i could bear
to find that i'm forsaken.
if you're a fantasy
then i'm content to be
in love with lovely you,
and pray my dream comes true.

you may vanish in the air,

then you might as well take the sun away
all the birds that flew in the summer sky

and our hearts were high
when the day was young and the night was long
and the moon stood still
for the night bird's song
if you go away, if you go away
if you go away, if you go away
but if you stay, i'll make you a day
like no day has been, or will be again
we'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
we'll talk to the trees, worship the wind
then if you go, i'll understand
leave me just enough love
to fill up my hand
if you go away, if you go away
if you go away, if you go away
if you go away, as i know you must
there'll be nothing left in the world to trust
just an empty room, full of empty space
like the empty look i see on your face
i'd have been the shadow of your dawn
if i thought it might have kept me
by your side
if you go away, if you go away
if you go away, please, don't go away"

starts you asking a daisy

have you ever felt a gentle touch

and never ever think of counting sheep
when your lonely heart has learned its lesson
you'd be hers if only she would call

that's the time you miss her most of all"

"it came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
from angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious king
the world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing.
still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
and still their heavenly music floats, o'er all the weary world.
above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
and ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing.
o ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
o rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing.
for lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
when with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
when the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king
and the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing."

i brought her my wildest of dreams, and she came up with the answer

she smiles and then   i am home again
'cause l.a. is my lady
she's always there for me
l.a. is my lady
she knows how to care for me
no lady's sweeter   you know it the moment you meet her

and love's kept me cool in july and warm in december
it may not have lasted, but each time i thought it was heaven
you name it, i've been there and back
lookin' for someone who   i'd be faithful to
l.a. is my lady
she's always there for me
l.a. is my lady
she knows how to care for me
she's good to me   yeah she's good to me
and that's why
l.a. is my lady   l.a. is my lady

kiss his lady bye bye"
"her day was born in shades of blue
her song was sad the words were true
her morning came too fast too soon
and died before the afternoon
poor lady day could use some love, some sunshine
lady day has too much rain
poor lady day could use some spring, some breezes
lady day has too much pain
it's such a lonely face
such a cloudy sky
so many shadows in her eye
so many empty dreams
so many bitter times
just a handful
of broken rhymes
poor lady day could use a smile, some kindness
lady day has too much rain
poor lady day could use some dreams, some flowers
lady day has too much pain
just too much to say
just to much to know
too little time to say hello
and then the evening comes
and now she doesn't cry
and it's too late to say
good bye"
"a moment after dark around the park, an old fashion gent comes parading,
dressed in funny clothes but singing as he goes, the lamplighter's serenade.
the old boy loves to talk with couples on the walk, but when it's half after love time,
he reaches for his stick and from his bag of tricks, he lights every star in the sky.
and if a lady or a beau should answer no, he sprinkles their hearts with his magic,
then he steals away to sing another day, the lamplighter's serenade."
"it's the last dance, we've come to the last dance
they're dimming the lights down, they're hoping we'll go
it's obvious they're aware of us, the pair of us
alone on the floor
still i want to hold you like this forever and more
it the last song, they're playing the last song
the orchestra's yawning, they're sleepy i know
they're wondering just when will we leave, but till we leave
keep holding me tight
through the last dance, each beat of the last dance
and save me the first dance in your dreams tonight"

last night when we were young
love was a star
a song unsung
life was so new
so real so right
ages ago last night
today the world is old
you flew away and time grew cold
where is that star
that shone so bright
ages ago last night
to think that spring had depended
on merely this a look, a kiss
to think that something so splended
could slip away in one little daybreak
so now let's reminisce and recollect the sighs and the kisses
the arms that clung
when we were young last night"

footsteps that you hear down the hall
the  that floats on a summer night
that you can never quite recall
and you see laura on a train that is passing through

that was laura but she's only a dream
she gave your very first kiss to you
that was laura
but she's only a dream"

five feet seven   of bones and skin
but when she tells me maybe she loves me
i feel as mellow as a fellow can be
she's so skinny   she's so drawn
when she stands sideways   you  think  she's gone
but when she calls me: ""baby""   i feel fine
to think she's frantically, romantically mine
she's slender, but she's tender
she makes my heart surrender
and every night, when i hold her tight
the feeling is nice   my arms can go around twice
my lean baby   she's so slim
a broomstick's wider   but not as trim
and when she starts to kiss me   then i know
i love her so, i'll never, ever, let her go
my lean baby   strange to see
and all that nothing   it belongs to me
and though she may be scrawny   she's ok
because i wouldn't want her any other way
she's so skinny   she's so drawn
when she stands sideways   you  think  she's gone
but when she calls me: ""baby""   i feel fine
to think she's frantically, romantically mine
i chased her   and i caught her
then a diamond ring   i bought her
 the diamonds shine   the ring is so fine
but here is the twist   she wears it right on her wrist
my lean baby   she's so slim
a broomstick's wider   but not as trim

the cigarettes you light   one after another
won't help you forget her   and the way that you love her
you're only burning   a torch you can't lose
but you're on the right track   for learnin' the blues
when you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you   constantly
when you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory
the nights when you don't sleep   the whole night you're crying
you just can't forget her   soon you even stop trying
you'll walk the floor   and wear out your shoes
when you feel your heart break   you're learnin' the  blues"

there is magic abroad in the air
i'm often told that the streets turn into gold
when the moon shines on * circus and square *
deep in the dark that envelops the park
there's romance in each cigarette glow
down by the thames, lights that sparkle like gems
seem to wink at each girl and her beau
up comes the moon when the city's asleep
he's not alone, for it seems
somewhere up there stands an angel to keep her watch
while each londoner dreams
my love and i saw the sun leave the sky
then we kissed in the fast fading light
most people say they love london by day
but lovers love london by night"

or a village in iowa
the only difference is the name
if you're alone
whether on main street
or on broadway
if you're alone
they are both the same
a town's a lonely town
when you pass through
and there is no one waiting there for you
then it's a lonely town
you wander up and down
the crowds rush by
a million faces pass before your eyes
still it's a lonely town
unless there's love
a love that's shining
like a harbor light
you're lost in the night
unless there's love
the world's an empty place
and every town's
a lonely town"

and he stated and promised he'd take special care
so it wouldn't get lost no more

and the clouds blow over and darken him

keeping track how it all goes on

song, from what was undoubtedly jerome kern's most memorable score. it's you and i, sweetie, with the
one of the loveliest songs in that show, show boat.
frankie: we could make believe i love you, only make believe that you love me.
janie: all that fine piece of mind in pretending, couldn't you, couldn't i, couldn't we?

make someone happy,
make just one someone happy.
make just one heart the heart you sing to.
one smile that cheers you,
one face that lights when it nears you.
one gal you're everything to.
fame, if you win it,
comes and goes in a minute.
where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
love is the answer,
someone to love is the answer.
once you've found her,
build your world around her.
make someone happy.
make just one someone happy
and you will be happy too."

another bride, another june
another sunny honeymoon
another season, another reason
for makin' whoopee
a lot of shoes, a lot of rice
the groom is nervous, he answers twice
its really killin' that he's so willin' to make whoopee
picture a little love nest
down where the roses cling
picture the same sweet love nest
and think what a year can bring
he's washin dishes and baby clothes
he's so ambitious he even sews
but don't forget folks,
thats what you get folks, for makin' whoopee"
"a small caf?mam'selle, our rendezvous, mam'selle.
the violins were warm and sweet, and so were you mam'selle.
and as the night danced by, a kiss became a sigh,

and yet i know too well someday you'll say goodbye,
then violins will cry, and so will i mam'selle."

he stood right there and he had hair galore
the man in the looking glass
who can he be
the man in the looking glass
can he possibly be me
where's our young romeo
the lad who used to sigh
who's the middle age lothario
with the twinkle in his eye
he seem so much wiser now
less lonely but then
could be he's only pretending again
man in the looking glass smiling away
how's your sacroiliac today
where's your first love affair
that trajedy d'amour
the true love you thought would be
the end of you for sure
the man in the looking glass
have no regrets
the man who's wise never forgets
that life is worth living if once in a while
you can look in that looking glass and smile"

not like the last time, and the time before
everybody loves a winner

it's gotta happen, happen sometime

just like a fool i stop and stare
it's really not the proper thing to do
but maybe you'll be there
i go out walking after midnight
along the lonely thoroughfare
it's not the time or place
to look for you
but maybe you'll be there
you said your arms would always hold me
you said you lips were mine alone to kiss
now after all those things you told me
how can it end like this
someday if all my prayers are answered
i'll hear a footstep on the stair
with anxious heart
i'll hurry to the door
and maybe you'll
be there"

frank, you'll never get rid of me
let all the others fight and fuss
whatever happens, we've got us.
me and my shadow
we're closer than pages that stick in a book
we're closer than ripples that play in a brook
strolling down the avenue
wherever you find him, you'll find me, just look
closer than a miser or the bloodhound's ?????
me and my shadow
we're closer than smog when it clings to l.a.
we're closer than bobby is to j.f.k.
not a soul can bust this team in two
we stick together like glue
and when it's sleeping time
that's when we rise
we start to swing
swing to the skies
our clocks don't chime
what a surprise
they ring a ding ding!
happy new year!
me and my shadow
and now to repeat what i said at the start
they'll need a large crowbar to break us apart
we're alone but far from blue
before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
we'll make all the late spots, and then a few more
we'll wind up at jilly's right after toot's shore
life is gonna be we wow whee!
for my shadow and me!

what is it, sam?
do me a favor?
what do you want, now?
would you mind taking it, just one more time?
from the top?
no! from the ending!

soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

i will wait for you till the sun falls from out of the sky
for what else can i do
i will wait for you

steals upon me in the night
forever taunts me

stranded high and dry
by a melancholy mood
gone is every joy and inspiration
tears are all i have to show
no consolation
all i can see is grief and gloom
till the crack of doom
oh, melancholy mood
deep in the night
i search for a trace
of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace
but love is a whimsy
and as flimsy as lace
and my arms embrace an empty space
melancholy mood, why must you blind me
pity me and break the chains
the chains that bind me
won't you release me, set me free
bring him back to me

don't you notice how hopelessly i'm lost

with sadness and yearning
i don't know why i turned my eyes away
but it's so easy looking at the game the morning after
adding up the kisses and the laughter
knowing how you'd play it
if the chance to play it over ever came
but then, a monday morning quarterback
never lost a game
the room was so alive with all her feelings and longings
i saw the spark of danger in her eyes
well, how would it have hurt me
if i'd turned back and held her?
a moment passes, something lovely dies
but it's so easy looking at the game the morning after
adding up the kisses and the laughter
knowing how you'd play it if the chance
to play it over ever came
but then, a monday morning quarterback never lost a game
yes, it's easier to win it when you know
you'd never play it quite the same

silly dreams i knew would disappear

why is it always reminding me of a love dream that never could be
sweet moon song that wasn't meant for me
it came gliding into my heart, riding on a moonbeam from above
sorrow and this and the whole world blended in a rhapsody of love
then i heard her singing to somebody else
what i thought was my melody
sweet moon song that wasn't meant for me"

we fell in love one summer night,
the stars hang low, the moon was white,
that's where i'll start when i write my memoirs.
the way you look, the things you said,
the clothes you wore, the books you read,
i'll tell of all these things in my memoirs.
as the pages turn, love lives anew, worth paint a picture of you
read between the lines, dear, if you will,
and you will learn that i love you still.
and there's a footnote referring you
back to the night you said we're through.
there's nothing more to say in my memoirs.
as the pages turn, love lives anew, worth paint a picture of you

this moment, this minute, and each second in it
will leave a glow upon the sky
and as time goes by
it will never die
this will be my shining hour
calm and happy and bright
and in my dreams, your face will flower
through the darkness of the night
like the lights of home, before me
or an angel, who's watching o'er me
this will be my shining hour
'til i'm with you again"
"i reach for you like i'd reach for a star,
worshipping you from afar, living with my silent love;
i'm like a flame dying out in the rain,
only the ashes remain, smouldering like my silent love;
how i long to tell all the things i have planned,
still it's wrong to tell, you would not understand,
you'll go along never dreaming i care,
loving somebody somewhere, leaving me my silent love."
"writer: silvers/van heusen
if i don't see her each day, i miss her
gee what a thrill, each time i kiss her
believe me, i've got a case
on nancy, with the laughing face
she takes the winter and makes it summer
and summer could take some lessons from her
picture a tomboy in lace
that's nancy with the laughing face
have you ever heard mission bells ringing
well she'll give you the very same glow
when she speaks you would think it was singing
just hear her say hello
i swear to goodness, you can't resist her
she's mighty sweet, and wait till you see her sister
no angel could replace
nancy, with the laughing face"
"there was a boy, a very strange enchanted boy
they say he wandered very far, very far, over land and sea
a little shy and sad of eye, but very wise was he
and then one day, a magic day he passed my way
and while we spoke of many things, fools and kings
this he said to me: ""the greatest thing you'll ever learn
is just to love and be loved in return""
<instrumental interlude>
""the greatest thing you'll ever learn

its not the pale moon that excites me
that thrills and delights me, oh no
its just the nearness of you
it isnt your sweet conversation
that brings this sensation, oh no
its just the nearness of you
when youre in my arms and i feel you so close to me
all my wildest dreams come true
i need no soft lights to enchant me

to hold you ever so tight
and to feel in the night the nearness of you"

when i'd be held under your thumb

moved and compelled, at your command
whether it's for bad or for good
i would never change it if i could
maybe i'm right, maybe i'm wrong
maybe i'm weak, maybe i'm strong
but nevertheless i'm in love with you
maybe i'll win, maybe i'll lose
and maybe i'm in for cryin' the blues
but nevertheless i'm in love with you
somehow, i know at a glance, the terrible chances i'm taking
fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking
maybe i'll live a life of regret, and maybe i'll give much more than i get
but nevertheless, i'm in love with you
in spite of all i could do
i went ahead falling for you
so if i laugh or i cry
i made my bed, that's where i'll lie
for what happens there's no excuse
i put my own head in the noose"

verse:
the man who only lives for making money
lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
likewise the man who works for fame
there's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
the fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
fall in love and you won't regret it
that's the best work of all, if you can get it
chorus:
holding hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky
nice work if you can get it
and you can get it if you try
strolling with the one girl
sighing sigh after sigh
nice work if you can get it
and you can get it if you try
just imagine someone
waiting at the cottage door
where two hearts become one
who could ask for anything more?
loving one who loves you
and then taking that vow
it's nice work if you can get it
and if you get it, won't you tell me how?"
"like the beat beat beat of the tom tom
when the jungle shadows fall
like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
as it stands against the wall
like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
when the summer shower is through
so a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
night and day, you are the one
only you beneath the moon or under the sun
whether near to me, or far
it's no matter darling where you are
i think of you
night and day, day and night, why is it so
that this longing for you follows wherever i go
in the roaring traffic's boom
in the silence of my lonely room
i think of you
night and day, night and day
under the hide of me
there's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
and this torment won't be through
until you let me spend my life making love to you
day and night, night and day"
"there was a moon out in space
but a cloud drifted over its face
you kissed me and went on your way
the night we called it a day
i heard the song of the spheres
like a minor lament in my ears
i hadn't the heart left to pray
the night we called it a day
soft through the dark
the hoot of an owl in the sky
sad though his song
no bluer was he than i
the moon went down stars were gone
but the sun didn't rise with the dawn
there wasn't a thing left to say
the night we called it a day
there wasn't a thing left to say
the night we called it a day"
"that certain night, the night we met
there was magic abroad in the air
there were angels dining at the ritz
and a nightingale sang in berkley square
i may be right, i may be wrong,
but i'm perfectly willing to swear,
that when you turned and smiled at me,
a nightingale sang in berkley square.
the moon that lingered over london town,
poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
how could he know we two were so in love,
the whole darn world seemed upside down.
the streets of town were paved with stars,
it was such a romantic affair.
and as we kissed and said goodnight,
a nightingale sang in berkley square."
"when no one cares
and the phone never rings
the nights are endless things
you're like a child that cries
and no one hears the crying
you're like a falling star that dies
and seems to go on dying
when no one cares
you just count so many years
and they glisten
with each tear
you can't believe that a love like hers
could come from someone new
when no one cares
but you"
"no one ever tells you what's like to love and lose,
how it feels to waken and have breakfast with the blues,
how to go on living, how to face another day,
no one ever tells you the way.
no one ever tells you how it feels to walk alone,
listening for those footsteps through the echo of your own.
suddenly it hits you all those dreams not worth a dime,
cause no one ever tells you in time.
long before the icy winds of winter,
autumn tells the swallows, time to fly,
why did she pretend till the bitter end
till it broke my heart to say goodbye.
and no one ever tells you that it's just another fling
no one ever warns you when your heart begins to sting
someone tells you later all is fair in love and war,
but no one ever tells you before.

"the world's a tiny blue green ark
afloat in darkest space.
and every creature lives his time
and knows his special place
and each of us is noah
with a life all in our care
to keep against the darkness
that's flooding everywhere
we've got to walk with the lion,
soar with the eagle,
sing with the nightingale
and live in love and peace.
the times have made us fearful
and our fears have brought the tears
the loneliness and darkness
have grown bitter with the years
but a light is just beyond us
and the children almost see
a world that we've forgotten
and the world they want to be
when we walk with the lion,
soar with the eagle,
sing with the nightingale
and live in love and peace.
the ark is getting crowded now
and each of us must know
when everything is finished here
there's no where else to go.
the beasts are here to bless us
and the faith is in their eyes
that we can find the garden
and see that sweet dawn rise
and we can walk with the lion,
soar with the eagle,
sing with the nightingale
and live in love and peace.

above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
yet in they dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

while mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
oh morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth.
and praises sing to god the king, and peace to men on earth.
how silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is given
so god imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heaven
no ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin
where meek souls will receive him still, the dear christ enters in.

cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today

"once upon a time
a girl with moonlight in her eyes
put her hand in mine
and said she loved me so
but that was once upon a time
very long ago
once upon a hill
we sat beneath a willow tree
counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
but that was once upon a time
now the tree is gone
how the breeze ruffled through her hair
how we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
we were young and didn't have a care
where did it go
once upon a time
the world was sweeter than we knew
everything was ours
how happy we were then
but somehow once upon a time
never comes again
once upon a time
never comes again"

there's no one in the place 'cept you and me
so set 'em' up joe

we're drinking my friend
to the end of a brief episode
so make it one for my baby
and one more for the road
i know the routine
put another nickel in that there machine
i'm feeling so bad
won't you make the music easy and sad
i could tell you a lot
but you gotta to be true to your code
so make it one for my baby
and one more for the road
you'd never know it
but buddy i'm a kind of poet
and i've got a lot of things i wanna say
and if i'm gloomy, please listen to me
till it's all, all talked away
well, that's how it goes
and joe i know you're gettin' anxious to close
so thanks for the cheer
i hope you didn't mind
my bending your ear
but this torch that i found
it's gotta be drowned
or it soon might explode
so make it one for my baby
and one more for the road"
"you know the one i love belongs to somebody else,
that's why she sings her songs to somebody else,
and even when you have your arms around her
you know her thoughts are with somebody else,
and when i hold her hand they belong to somebody else
and you can bet they're not so cold to somebody else,
it's tough to be alone on a shelf,
and it is worse to fall in love by yourself
when the one you love belongs to somebody else."

other notes are sure to follow
but the root is still that note
now this new note is the consequence of the one we've just been through
as i'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you
there's so many people who can talk and talk and talk
and just say nothing or nearly nothing
i have used up all the scale i know and at the end i've come
to nothing i mean nothing
so i come back to my first note as i must come back to you
i will pour into that one note all the love i feel for you
any one who wants the whole show show do re mi fa so la ci do
he will find himself with no show better play the note you know"

only forever if you care to know.
would i grant all your wishes and be proud of the task,
only forever if someone should ask.

offhand i would figure, less than a second.
do you think i'll remember how you looked when you smiled,
only forever, that's putting it mild."
"each place i go only the lonely go
some little small caf√£¬®
the songs i know only the lonely know
each melody recalls a love that used to be
the dreams i dream only the lonely dream
of lips as warm as may
that hopeless scheme only the lonely scheme
that soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care
and you recall each fun time
those picnics at the beach when love was new
it well could be the one time
a hopeless little dream like that comes true
if you find love hang on to each caress
and never let love go
for when it's gone you'll know the loneliness
the heartbreak only the lonely know"

our love affair was meant to be,
it's me for you dear and you for me.
we'll fuss, we'll quarrel and tears start to brew
but after the tears
our love will smile through.
i'm sure that i could never hide
the thrill i get when you're by my side
and when we're older we'll proudly declare,
wasn't ours a lovely love affair.
our love affair will be such fun,
we'll be the envy of everyone.
those famous lovers we'll make them forget
from adam and eve to scarlett and rhett.

two happy people who say on the square,

was more enchanted by a lorelei than i,
after waiting so long for the right time,
after reaching so long for a star,
all at once, from the long and lonely night time
and despite time, here you are.
i'd cry out of this world, if you said you were through.
so let me fly out of this world
and spend the next eternity or two with you."

when all the clouds darken up the skyway
there's a rainbow highway to be found
leading from your windowpane
to a place behind the sun
just a step beyond the rain
somewhere, over the rainbow
way up high
there's a land that i dreamed of
once in a lullabye
somewhere, over the rainbow
skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream
really do come true
some day i'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are
far
behind me
where laughter falls like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
that's where you'll find me
somewhere, over the rainbow
skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream
really do come true
if happy little bluebirds fly
beyond the rainbow

sparkled on a pug nosed dream

as we floated over the floor
there were questions but my heart knew all the answers

"writer: anderson/weill
oh, it's a long, long while from may to december
but the days grow short when you reach september
when the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
one hasn't got time for the waiting game
oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
september, november
and these few precious days i'll spend with you
these precious days i'll spend with you"
"serenade in blue
when i hear that serenade in blue
i'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
sharing all the joys we used to know, many moons ago.
once again your face comes back to me
just like the theme of some forgotten melody
in the album of my memory, serenade in blue
it seems like only yesterday, the small cafe, a crowded floor
and as we danced the night away, i hear you say forever more
and then the song became a sigh
forever more became goodbye
but you remained in my heart, so
tell me darling in there still a spark?
or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
should i go on whistling in the dark, serenade in blue."
"the shadow of your smile
when you have gone
will color all my dreams
and light the dawn
look into my eyes, my love, and see
all the lovely things, you are, to me
our wistful little star
it was far, too high
a teardrop kissed your lips
and so, so did i
now when i remember spring
and every little lovely thing
i will be remembering
the shadow of your smile
your lovely smile"
"writer:
there were shadows on the sand closely mingled,
just two lovers by a moonlit sea,
while i watched i thought of you and i tingled,
for they kissed the way you did with me.
then the shadows on the sand came much nearer,
and the moon was like a spotlight then,
there was one familiar face showing clearer,
it was you, i couldn't look again.
i felt so sad, there you were with someone new,
i felt so glad, when i found it wasn't true.
for the shadows on the sand seemed to break up,
and i looked around me with a start,
when the pounding of my heart made me wake up.
>from a dream that nearly broke my heart."
"shake down the stars, pull down the clouds,
turn off the moon, do it soon,
i can't enjoy the night without you,
shake down the stars.
dry up the streams, stop all my dreams,
cut off the breeze, do it please,
i never thought i'd cry about you,
shake down the stars.
i gave you my arms, my lips, my heart,
my love, my life, my all,
but the best that i had to offer you
i found was all too small.
crush every rose, hush every pray'r,
break every vow, do it now,
i know i cannot live without you,
shake down the stars."

she says she's lost some weight
she says she's seen some shows
she says the city's strange
she says the weather's cold
she says there's been some rain
she says there's lots to see
she says she hopes we're fine

"i'm not much to look at, nothin' to see
just glad i'm livin' and happy to be

she'd be so much better off if i went away
but why should i leave her, why should i go?
she'd be unhappy without me, i know
i got a woman, crazy for me

"the sky fell down when i met you,
the green of the countryside has turned to blue,
i had the moon right on my fingertips,
and when first we kissed, there were stars on your lips.

that walking on snowy clouds was not a dream,
you gave to me all this and heaven too,
when the sky fell down and i met you."

sleep warm, sleep well, my love.
rest your head on your pillow, what a lucky pillow,

sweet dreams of me, my love.
close your eyes now and kiss me, and whisper you miss me,
sleep tight, sleep well, sleep warm."

i wonder what he'll think of me
i guess he'll call me the ""old man""
i guess he'll think i can lick
ev'ry other feller's father
well, i can!
i bet that he'll turn out to be
the spittin' image of his dad
but he'll have more common sense
than his puddin headed father ever had
i'll teach him to wrassle
and dive through a wave
when we go in the mornin's for our swim
his mother can teach him
the way to behave
but she won't make a sissy out o' him
not him! not my boy! not bill!
bill. i will see that he is named after me, i will.
my boy, bill! he'll be tall
and tough as a tree, will bill!
like a tree he'll grow
with his head held high
and his feet planted firm on the ground
and you won't see nobody dare to try
to boss or toss him around!
no pot bellied, baggy eyed bully'll toss him around
i don't give a damn what he does
as long as he does what he likes!
he can sit on his tail
or work on a rail
with a hammer, hammering spikes!
he can ferry a boat on a river
or peddle a pack on his back
or work up and down
the streets of a town
with a whip and a horse and a hack
he can haul a scow along a canal
run a cow around a corral
or maybe bark for a carousel
of course it takes talent to do that well
he might be a champ of theheavyweights
or a feller that sells you glue
or president of the united states
that'd be all right, too
his mother would like that
but he wouldn't be president unless he wanted to be
not bill!
my boy, bill! he'll be tall
and as tough as a tree, will bill
like a tree he'll grow
with his head held high
and his feet planted firm on the ground
and you won't see nobody dare to try
to boss or toss him around!
no fat bottomed, flabby faced, pot bellied, baggy eyed bastard'll boss
him around
and i'll be damned if he'll marry the boss' daughter
a skinny lipped virgin with blood like water
who'll give him a peck
and call it a kiss
and look in his eyes through a lorgnet
say, why am i talkin' on like this?
my kid ain't even been born, yet!
i can see him when he's seventeen or so
and startin' to go with a girl
i can give him lots of pointers, very sound
on the way to get 'round any girl
i can tell him ...
wait a minute!
could it be?
what the hell!
what if he is a girl?
what would i do with her?
what could i do for her?
a bum with no money!
you can have fun with a son
but you got to be a father to a girl
she mighn't be so bad at that
a kid with ribbons in her hair!
a kind o' neat and petite
little tin type of her mother!
what a pair!
i can just hear myself bragging about her!
my little girl
pink and white
as peaches and cream is she
my little girl
is half again as bright
as girls are meant to be!
dozens of boys pursue her
many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
>from her faithful dad
she has a few
pink and white young fellers of two and three
but my little girl
gets hungry ev'ry night and she come home to me!
my little girl, my little girl!
i got to get ready before she comes!
i got to make certain that she
won't be dragged up in slums
with a lot o' bums like me
she's got to be sheltered
and be dressed in the best money can buy!
i never knew how to get money
but, i'll try, by god! i'll try!
i'll go out and make it or steal it
or take it or die!"
"some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
you may see a stranger across a crowded room

some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
you may hear her laughing across a crowded room
and night after night, as strange as it seems
the sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams
who can explain it, who can tell you why?
fools give you reasons, wise men never try

"how can you say something new about being alone
tell somebody you're a loner?
right away they think you're lonely
it's not the same thing, you know
it's not wanting to put all your marbles in one pocket
and that's caring enough not to care too much
mostly, i guess it's letting yourself come first for a while
one day, i'm gonna find me an island, a think place
go there with a mess of records and a ukalele
just sit strumming, i might even do some thinking
about the women and the towns that i left behind"

may all your days be a wonderful song of love
open your arms and sing of all the hidden hopes you'll ever treasure
and live out your life in peace
where shall i look for the love to replace you
someone to light up my life
someone with strange little ways
eyes like a blue autumn haze
someone with your laughing style
and a smile that i know will keep haunting me endlessly
sometimes in stars or the swift flight of seabirds
i catch a moment of you
thats why i walk all alone

searching for something or someone to light up my life"

someone who'll watch over me

i know i could always be good
to one who'll watch over me

south of the border   mexico way
then she smiled as she whispered ""manjanna""
never dreaming that we were parting
then i lied as a whispered ""manjanna""

love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
i feel wherever i go that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon
time is so old and love so brief

"once there was a thing called spring,
when the world was writing verses like yours and mine.
all the lads and girls would sing,
when we sat at little tables and drank may wine.
now april, may, and june are sadly out of tune,
life has stuck a pin in the balloon.
spring is here! why doesn't my heart go dancing?
spring is here! why isn't the waltz entrancing?
no desire, no ambition leads me,
maybe it's because nobody needs me?
spring is here! why doesn't the breeze delight me?
stars appear! why doesn't the night invite me?
maybe it's because nobody loves me,
spring is here, i hear!"

verse:
and now the purple dusk of twilight time
steals across the meadows of my heart
high up in the sky the little stars climb
always reminding me that we're apart
you wander down the lane and far away
leaving me a song that will not die
love is now the stardust
of yesterday
the music
of the years
gone by
chorus:
sometimes i wonder why i spend
the lonely nights
dreaming of a song.
the melody haunts my reverie
and i am once again with you.
when our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration.
but that was long ago, and now my consolation
is in the stardust of a song.
beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
you are in my arms
the nightingale tells his fairy tale
of paradise where roses grew.
though i dream in vain, in my heart you will remain
my stardust melody
the memory of love's refrain."

a situation   so heavenly
a fairy land where no one else could enter

my heart beat  like a hammer
 arms wound around you tight

two sweethearts, and the summer wind
like painted kites, those days and nights
they went flyin' by
the world was new, beneath a blue
umbrella sky
then softer than, a piper man
one day it called to you
and i lost you, i lost you to the summer wind
the autumn wind, and the winter winds
they have come and gone
and still the days, those lonely days
they go on and on
and guess who sighs his lullabies
through nights that never end
my fickle friend, the summer wind
the summer wind
warm summer wind
mmm the summer wind"

why i love my sweet lorraine
when it's raining i don't miss the sun
'cause it's in my sweetie's smile
just think that i'm the lucky one
who will lead her down the aisle
each night how i pray
that nobody steals her heart away
i can't wait until that lucky day

take me out with the crowd;
buy me some peanuts and cracker jack,
i don't care if i never get back.
let me root, root, root for the home team,
if they don't win, it's a shame.
for it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,
at the old ball game.
nelly kelly was sure some fan,
she would root just like any man,
told the umpire he was wrong,
all along,
good and strong.
when the score was just two to two,
nelly kelly knew what to do,
just to cheer up the boys she knew,
she made the gang sing this song:"

she'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

you hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

journeys on a jet

and vegas and roulette
how lucky i was
and thanks for the memory
of summers by the sea
dawn in waikiki
we had a pad in london
but we didn't stop for tea
how cozy it was
now since our breakup i wake up
alone on a gray morning after
i long for the sound of your laughter
and then i see the laugh's on me
but thanks for the memory
of every touch a thrill
i've been through the mill
i've lived a lot and learned a lot
you loved me not and still
i miss you so much

of how we used to jog
even in a fog
that barbecue in malibu
away from all the smog
how rainy it was
thanks for the memory
of letters i destroyed
books that we enjoyed
tonight the way things look
i need a book by sigmund freud
how brainy he was
gone are those evenings on broadway
together we'd go to a great show
but now i begin with the late show
and wish that you
were watching, too

they looked up and saw a star
shining in the east, beyond them far,
and to the earth it gave great light,
and so it continued, both day and night.

three wise men came from country far,
to seek for a king was their intent,
and to follow the star whereever it went.
this star drew nigh to the northwest;
o'er bethlehem it took its rest.
and there it did both stop and stay,
right over the place whcre jesus lay.
then they did know assuredly
within that house, the king did lie
one entered in then for to see
and found the babe in poverty.
then entered in those wise men three,
full reverently, upon bended knee,
and offered there, in his presence,
their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

this is my quest, to follow that star
no matter how hopeless, no matter how far
to be willing to give when there's no more to give
to be willing to die so that honor and justice may live
and i know if i'll only be true to this glorious quest
that my heart will lie peaceful and calm when i'm laid to my rest
and the world will be better for this
that one man, scorned and covered with scars,
still strove with his last ounce of courage
to reach the unreachable star"

you smiled and i was taken by surprise
i guess i should have seen right through you

i gave my heart without a compromise

when the moon got in my eyes
i thought a kingdom was in sight
that i would have the right to claim
but with the morning's early light
i didn't have a dream to my name

will it be my luck to win you?
may i look that far?
my love is mellow and my hopes are strung
around that cupid fellow, behold the moon is yellow
and the night is young

there are those who'd bet
love comes but once   and yet

nine drummers drumming, eight maids milking, seven swans swimming
six geese laying, five gold rings
four calling birds, three french hens, two turtle doves,
and a partridge in a pear tree

nine games of scrabble, eight pairs of cufflinks, seven books of fiction,
six golden lighters, five ivory combs,
four mission lights, three golf clubs, two silken scarfs,

i sang the words and they made you mine
i'd steal a kiss and repeat each line
over and over and over, over and then

when you said, ""so long"", but i was wrong
there goes that song again"

and there i go, acting not so smart again
but though it's unwise, i can't disguise my love.

there i go, led astray by my desire
there's no golden rule to guide a fool in love.
i tell my heart, ""be careful, or you'll find that you dream alone.""

and there i go thrillingly in love with you.

a telephone that rings but who's to answer?

sad is to live in solitude
far from your tranquil altitude
sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream

a heart that stops when you pass by
only to cause me pain

"intro:
in the hustle of the day, we're all inclined to miss
little things that mean so much
a word, a smile, and a kiss
when a woman loves a man, he's a hero in her eyes
and a hero he can always be if he'll just realize
she may be weary, women do get weary
wearing the same shabby dress
and when she's weary, try a little tenderness
she may be waiting, just anticipating
things she may never possess
while she's without them, try a little tenderness
it's not just sentimental, she has her grief and her care
but a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear
you won't regret it, women don't forget it
love is their whole happiness
and it's all so easy, try a little tenderness"
"two in love can face the world together,
hearts that cuddle up will muddle through,
the world may rock and rumble,
crowds may groan and grumble,
thrones may even tumble too,

laugh aloud at every cloud above,
and so we'll show them all what love can do,
for you and i are two in love."

"it was winter in manhattan, falling snow flakes filled the air
the streets were covered with a film of ice

changed the weather all around, just within a thrice
i bought you violets for your furs

i bought you violets for your furs
and there was april in that december
the snow drifted down on the flowers
and it melted where it lay
the snow looked like dew on the blossoms
as on a summer day
i bought you violets for your furs
and there was blue in the wintry sky
then you pinned my violets to your furs
and gave a lift to the crowds passing by
you smiled at me so sweetly
since then one thought occurs
that we fell in love completely
the day that i bought you violets for your furs"

and i don't want to miss a thing when the future appears.
i like to sit outside on a summer night with a drink in my hand.

what time does the next miracle leave?

count me in, <count me in , count me in>
<count me in, count me in , count me in>
<count me in, count me in , count me in>
""ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.""

and the girl i have waited for, will be waiting for me,
and she'll dance with me all the afternoon,
comfort me when the darkness falls,
and she'll still be there in the morning when i need her the most.
maybe when i get to venus, i will never be lonely again.

pluto is a rotten place an evil place they got in space,
it's hades  filled with rats for self defense,

but you can bet your ass i'll lead a lot of friends there,
""next stop, mercury, mercury, neptune""
mercury will lead us out to neptune and her deep blue sea.
 and then to uranus uranus is heaven,
how will i know? i will know, if they need me at the station,
with some cheese and some mayo pizza,
well done , and a little red wine.

i thought i'd wait and now it's too late,
my song of love is a sigh.
though i've tried to keep the tears inside,
you just can't put aside a heart in pain.
people say the teardrops seldom say,
that hearts that cry today may love again.
so i'll just go on dreaming my dreams
and maybe someday, as strange as it seems,
my heart will sing and i'll know it's spring,
when love comes again.
though i've tried to keep the tears inside,

"when no one cares
and the phone never rings
the nights are endless things
you're like a child that cries
and no one heeds the crying
you're like a falling star that dies
and seems to go on dying
when no one cares
you just count souvenirs
and they glisten with your tears
you can't believe a love like hers
could come from someone new
when no one cares   but you"
"when somebody loves you, you feel it in your heart
when somebody loves you, you know it from the start
every kiss becomes more than a kiss
each look, each touch they mean so much
and that's when you discover how it feels to be a lover
when somebody loves you, it shows in every smile
when somebody loves you, your life becomes worthwhile
always caring, always sharing everything you do
when somebody loves you like i love you
always caring, always sharing everything you do
when somebody loves you like i love you"
"when the wind was green
at the start of the spring
when the wind was green
like a living thing
it was on my lips
and it's kiss was fair
you were there
when the wind was red
like a summer wine
when the wind was red
like your lips on mine
it caressed my fate
and it tossed my hair
you were there
then came the fall and all of love
came tumbling, stumbling down
like leaves that lost to frost and found
they were flying crying
in a brown wind dying
but the winter's come and we both should know
that the wind is white like the swirling snow
and we'll never see all the wonderful things to be seen
when the wind is green"
"when you awake, the day takes a bow at your door,
when you awake, the sun shines like never before,
cloud soaked with rain find it hard to explain to the earth below,
they can't let it rain for then it would stain a heavenly show, you make it so,
when you awake, you open the eyes of my heart,
when you awake, my day really gets its great start,
all the winds and the birds join the simple refrain of a rippling stream,
my world becomes a midsummer night's dream, when you awake."
"when you're smilin', when you're smilin'
the whole world smiles with you
when you're laughin', when you're laughin'
the sun comes shinin' through
but when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
so stop that cryin', be happy again
keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin'
the whole world smiles with you
when you're smilin', when you're smilin'
the whole world, it smiles with you
when you're laughin', oh babe, when you're laughin'
the sun would a come shining through
but when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
so stop that sighin', come on and be happy again
keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin', baby
the whole world smiles with you"

what good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
that comes with each new love affair
the dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
and leaves you with castles in air
when you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
when you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
at break of dawn, there is no sunrise
when your lover has gone
what lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
what lonely hours, with memories lingering
like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
when your lover has gone"

where have you gone without me
i thought you cared about me
where are you
where's my heart
where is the dream we started
i can't believe we're parted
where are you

what had we to gain
when i gave you my love
was it all in vain
all life through
must i go on pretending
where is my happy ending

"i found your lips tonight
but where do you keep your heart?
i found your arms just right
but where do you keep your heart?
it's very plain to see i'll never win you
unless you long for me deep down within you
i looked into your eyes
to see if you really care
you took me to the skies
but where do we go from there?
oh, it's been such a lovely evening
but darling, before we part
please tell me where you keep your heart"
"where is the one
who'll end the search i'm making
where is the one
who'll change my dream to waking
behind some far off secret door
there's my love
there's my life
in store
the journey's long
much longer than i reckoned
in any throng
i'll know her in a second
some lucky day
i'm bound to find her
and when i do
i'll find love
the journey's long
much longer than i reckoned
in any throng
i'll know her in a second
some lucky day
i'm bound to find her

i'll find love"
"when you're awake the things you think
come from the dream you dream
thought has wings, and lots of things
are seldom what they seem
sometimes you think you've lived before
all that you live today
things you do come back to you
as though they knew the way
oh the tricks your mind can play
it seems we stood and talked like this, before
we looked at each other in the same way then
but i can't remember where or when
the clothes you are wearing are the clothes you wore
the smile you are smiling you were smiling then
but i can't remember where or when
some things that happened for the first time
seem to be happening again
and so it seems that we have met before
and laughed before, and loved before
but who knows where or when."
"whispering while you cuddle near me,
whispering so no one can hear me,
each little whisper seems to cheer me
i know it's true, there's no one, dear, but you.
whispering why you'll never leave me,
whispering why you'll never grieve me,
whisper and say that you'll believe me
whispering that i love you."

whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
left my heart a breaking, and making a moan
murmur to the night to hide its starry light
so none will see me sighing and crying all alone

we'll say no man
but you can do the job
when you're in town

as we dream, by the fire

the plans that we've made

ev'ry meeting's marvelous pastime.
you're increasingly sweet,
so whenever we happened to met
i greet you ...
refrain
with a song in my heart
i behold your adorable face.
just a song at the start
but it soon is a hymn to your grace.
when the music swells
i'm touching you hand
it tells that your're standing near, and ..
at the sound of your voice
heaven opens his portals to me.
can i help but rejoice
that a song such as ours came to be?
but i always knew
i would live life through
with a song in my heart for you.
verse 2
oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
and these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
and the words in my ears
will resound for the rest of my years.
in the morning i find with delight
not a note of our music is played out.
it will be just as sweet,
and an air that i'll live to repeat:
i greet you ...

with every breeze that wanders by.
and your name is a song

but a sigh that i'll always care.

seems that i hear love say:
""some day, some way.""

a man is born, but he's no good no how
without a song

is strung in my soul

keep on feeding the fire, till the fire is hot,
with those un neighborly feelings we deny we've got.
keep on trying for peace, until that peace is won.

yellow days, where'd you go?
life is empty and the sunlight seems so harsh instead of tender
and the laughter's just an echo i'll remember yellow days, yellow days.

a lovely melody
our hearts would sing along

forever to be played
but you forgot all the words
while i still remember the tune
we used to dance
instead of walk
we used to sing
instead of talk
why was our love song
that used to be
only the start of the blues for me
but songs are funny things
they never really die
and so my hope still clings
that someday you will try
to just remember the words

and midnight songs will start
our song i must admit
still fills my hopeful heart
so please remember the words

the thoughts i long to bring to you
when i hear lonely singers
who are just as lost as me
making noise, not melody
you will be my music
you will be song
you will be my music
i can't wait any longer if i'm wrong
i'll never find the song to tell me
all the things i need to say
and i'm afraid as time goes by
that someday soon you'll go away
and i'll be lost in trying
for songs i'll never sing
wanting you is everything
you will be my music
you will be song
you will be my music
i can't wait any longer if i'm wrong
i can't wait any longer for my song"
"you'd be so easy to love
easy to idolize all others above
so worth the yearning for
so swell to keep the home fire burning for
we'd be so grand at the game
so carefree together, that it does seem a shame
that you can't see your future with me
'cause you'd be so easy to love"
"writer: comden/green/styne
verse:
it's not that you're fairer
than a lot of girls just as pleasin'
that i doff my hat
as a worshipper at your shrine
it's not that you're rarer
than asparagus out of season
no, my darling, this is the reason
why you've got to be mine
chorus:
you'd be so nice to come to
you'd be so nice by the fire
while the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
you'd be all that i could desire
under stars chilled by the winter
under an august moon burning above
you'd be so nice
you'd be paradise, to come home to and love"
"writer: gordon/warren
darling, i'm so blue without you
i think about you the live long day
when you ask me if i'm lonely
then i only have this to say
you'll never know just how much i miss you
you'll never know just how much i care
and if i tried, i still couldn't hide my love for you
you ought to know, for haven't i told you so
a million or more times?
you went away and my heart went with you
i speak your name in my ev'ry prayer
if there is some other way to prove that i love you
i swear i don't know how
you'll never know if you don't know now
you'll never know just how much i miss you
you'll never know just how much i care
you said good bye, no stars in the sky refuse to shine
take it from me, it's no fun to be alone
with moonlight and memories"
"when you walk through a storm,
hold your head up high,
and don't be afraid of the dark.
at the end of the storm,
is the golden sky,
and the sweet silver song of the lark.
walk on through the wind,
walk on through the rain,
though your dreams be tossed and blown,
walk on, walk on with hope in your heart,
and you'll never walk alone,
you'll never walk alone."
"you're breaking my heart all over again.
oh why did we start all over again?
it's too late now to wish i had never met you.
i've loved you much too much to just forget you.
if we ever part all over again,
will i fall in love, no never again!
you said you'd love me, you made a vow,
look what you're doing now,
you're breaking my heart all over again."
"you, you're driving me crazy! what did i do? what did i do?
my tears for you make everything hazy, clouding the skies of blue
how true, were the friends who were near me to cheer me
believe, me they knew, but you
were the kind who would hurt me, desert me
when i needed you
yes you, you're driving me crazy! what did i do to you?"
"writer: h. warren/a. dubin
every kiss, every hug
seems to act just like a drug
you're getting to be a habit with me
let me stay in your arms
i'm addicted to your charms
you're getting to be a habit with me
i used to think your love was something i could take or leave alone
but now i couldn't do without my supply
i need you for my own
oh, i can't break away
i must have you everyday
as regularly as coffee or tea
you've got me in your clutches and i can't break free
you're getting to be a habit with me"
"you're lonely and i'm lonely,
so why can't we be lonely together?
the night is young and while it grows older
we can't forget crying on each other's shoulder.
the sky's cloudy 'cause we're lonely,
but soon we'll see a change in the weather,
two lonely hearts beating as one,
can be miserable and still have a lot of fun."
"you're my girl the boys all know, you're my girl, i've told them so.
you should have seen how their faces fell when they were wishing me well.
they called me a lucky guy, and i couldn't hide a feeling of pride.
you're my girl, i've chosen you to be mine, my whole life through.
and if this heart of mine had a voice, you'd hear it second my choice,
you're what i've waited for, and you're my girl.
the kids that see me come to call have written your name and my name on the
wall.
it's common gossip everywhere, that you and i have got it bad for fair.
you're my girl, i've chosen you to be mine my whole life through,
and if this heart of mine had a voice, you'd hear it second my choice,
you're what i `ve waited for, and you're my girl."
"writer: morgan/stock/cavanaugh
you're nobody till somebody loves you
you're nobody till somebody cares
you might be king, you might possess, the world and its gold
but gold won't bring you happiness, when you're growing old
the world still is the same
you'll never change it
as sure as the stars shine above
you're nobody till somebody loves you
so find yourself somebody to love"
"you're part of my heart,
and now that you're gone, the stars refuse to shine,
oh how could they glow when all of them know
that you're no longer mine.
you're part of my heart,
and i won't believe that you've forgotten me,
those nights in the lane, your love was so plain,
you can't ignore my plea.
my world is filled with loneliness
now that you've said we're through,
i'm sure that we were meant to be,
but how can i prove it to you?
you're part of my heart,
my love will go on until eternity,
you reign in my soul beyond my control,
'cause you're part of me."
"writer: porter
a thorough knowledge i've got about girls
i've been around
and after learning a lot about girls
this is the important fact i found
i've no proof when people say
i'm more or less aloof
but you're sensational
i don't care if you are called,
""the fair miss frigidaire""
'cause you're sensational
making love is quite an art
what you require
is the proper squire
to fire your heart
and if you say
that one fine day
you'll let me come to call
we'll have a ball
'cause you're sensational, sensational
that's all, that's all, that's all"
"you're so right for what's wrong in my life.
you're as right as rain; how can i explain?
you just fill every void in my life.
oh, so right for what's wrong.
fingers reaching; searching for the touch
of love's first meeting. something tells me that
you're right for what's wrong in my life.
you're as right as rain; how can i explain?
you just fill all the need in my heart.
oh, so right for what's wrong.
you've changed my world into a shangri la.
without a single word, i knew that you
would right every wrong in my life.
through the darkness of night,
you're my one shining light.
you're so right for what's wrong."
"everybody knows you're stepping on my toes
and stepping on my heart strings too,
with an idle kiss, you grabbed a moment's bliss,
that left me with a heart that's true.
how was i to know i did not stand a show
the day i fell in love with you.
you made me believe that i was your one need
and then you said that we were through.
love was a grand sensation,
until i later found that it was imitation
of love that let me down.
everybody knows your every action shows
that love is just a game to you.
but that's how love goes, you're stepping on my toes,
and stepping on my heart strings too."
"fairy tales can come true
it can happen to you
if you're young at heart
for it's hard you will find
to be narrow of mind
if you're young at heart
you can go to extremes
with impossible schemes
you can laugh when your dreams
fall apart at the seams
and life gets more exciting
with each passing day
and love is either in your heart
or on it's way
don't you know that it's worth
every treasure on earth
to be young at heart
for as rich as you are
it's much better by far
to be young at heart
and if you should survive to 105
look at all you'll derive
out of being alive
and here is the best part
you've had a head start
if you are among the very
young at heart
and if you should survive to 105
think of all you'll derive
out of being alive
and here is the best part
you've had a head start
if you are among the very
young at heart..."
"younger than springtime are you
softer than starlight are you
warmer than winds of june
are the gentle lips you gave me
g**er than laughter are you
sweeter than music are you
sunlight and moon beans
heaven and earth
are you to give me
and when your youth and joy
invade my soul
and fill my heart
as now they do, then
younger than springtime am i
g**er than laughter am i
sunlight and moon beans
heaven and earth
am i with you"
"yours is my heart alone
and without you, life holds no charm.
yours every thought i own,
our love the theme of every dream.
all that makes life seem worthwhile
dwells in your eyes and the spell of your smile.
there is no song half so sweet to me
as your voice whispering i love you dear."
"never could carry a tune
never knew where to start
you came along, when everything was wrong
and put a song in my heart
dear when you smiled at me
i heard a melody
it haunted me from the start
something inside of me, started a symphony
zing! went the strings of my heart
'twas like a breath of spring
heard a robin sing
'bout a nest set apart
all nature seemed to be, in perfect harmony
zing! went the strings of my heart
your eyes made skies blue again
what else could i do again
keep repeating through again
i love you, i love you
i still recall the thrill
guess i always will
i hoped will never depart
all nature seemed to be, in perfect harmony
zing! went the strings of my heart"
