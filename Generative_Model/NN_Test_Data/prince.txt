"i never meant to cause you any sorrow
i never meant to cause you any pain
i only wanted one time to see you laughing
i only want to see you laughing in the purple rain
purple rain, purple rain i only want to see you bathing in the purple rain
i never wanted to be your weekend lover
i only wanted to be some kind of friend
baby i could never steal you from another
it's such a shame our friendship had to end
purple rain, purple rain i only want to see you underneath the purple rain
honey, i know, i know, i know times are changing
it's time we all reach out for something new, that means you too
you say you want a leader,
but you can't seem to make up your mind
i think you better close it
and let me guide you into the purple rain
purple rain, purple rain i only want to see you, only want to see you
in the purple rain"
"dig if you will the picture
of you and i engaged in a kiss
the sweat of your body covers me
can you my darling  can you picture this?
dream if you can
a courtyard
an ocean of violets in bloom
animals strike curious poses
they feel the heat
the heat between me and you
how can you just leave me standing?
alone in a world that's so cold
maybe i'm just too demanding
maybe i'm just like my father too bold
maybe you're just like my mother
she's never satisfied
why do we scream at each other
this is what it sounds like when doves cry.
touch if you will my stomach
feel how it trembles inside
you've got the butterflies all tied up
don't make me chase you
even doves have pride
how can you just leave me standing?
alone in a world so cold?
maybe i'm just too demanding
maybe i'm just like my father too bold
maybe you're just like my mother
she's never satisfied
why do we scream at each other
this is what it sounds like when doves cry
how can you just leave me standing?
alone in a world that's so cold?
maybe i'm just too demanding
maybe i'm just like my father too bold
maybe you're just like my mother
she's never satisfied
why do we scream at each other
this is what it sounds like
when doves cry
when doves cry when doves cry 
don't cry 
when doves cry
when doves cry
when doves cry
when doves cry (doves cry, doves cry, doves cry
don't cry
darling don't cry
don't cry

"i was dreamin' when i wrote this
forgive me if it goes astray

tryin' to run from the destruction
you know i didn't even care
they say two thousand zero, zero, party over,
oops, out of time!
so tonight i'm gonna party like it's 1999!
i was dreamin' when i wrote this
so sue me if i go too fast
but life is just a party
and parties weren't meant to last
war is all around us
my mind says prepare to fight
so if i gotta die
i'm gonna listen to my body tonight

"dearly beloved ..
we are gathered here today
to get through this thing called life.
electric word ""life"", it means forever
and that's a mighty long time
but i'm here to tell you
there's something else .. the afterworld
a world of never ending happiness
you can always see the sun, day or night.
so when u call up that shrink in beverly hills   
you know the one .. dr. everything'll be alright.
`stead of asking him how much of you're time is left
ask him how much of you're mind, baby
`cause in this life things are much harder than in the afterworld
in this life you're on your own !
and if the elevator tries to bring u down
go crazy .. punch a higher floor !
if you don't like the world you're living in
take a look around you, at least you got friends.
i called my old lady for a friendly word
she just picked up the phone .. dropped it on the floor
""ssss ahh, sss ahh !"" is all i heard.
chorus :
i'm not gonna let the elevator bring us down
oh no, let's go .. let's go crazy !
let's get nuts
let's look for the purple banana `til they put us in the truck
let's go !
all excited, don't know why
maybe it's `cause we're all gonna die
and when we do, what's it all for?
better live now, before the grim reaper comes knocking on your door
tell me baby ..
are we gonna let the elevator bring us down?
dr. everything'll be alright ..
make everything go wrong.
pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
hang tough children ..
he's coming .. he's coming .. he's coming !"
"""hey, it's the man! yeah, let's see what's going on!""
chorus:
trust   who do ya?
trust   what makes u a real lover?
trust   i put this question to ya
cuz i want u 2 be with me
love   u cannot imagine
how much i want 2 give 2 u
hot   i get so excited
just thinkin' about all we could do
dig it now
another world awaits us
another power 2 see
close   don't worry about nobody else
from now on u'll be here with me
chorus
money   how much'll make u happy?
u can have it all if it'll suit u right
but nothin', i said nothin' can take the place
of u and me kickin' it tight, tight!
come, it's easy
just let yourself go   don't put up a fight
sex   it's not that type of party
girl, we're gettin' higher 2 night
chorus
""get 'em! take the pictures!""
""gotham's greed!""
trust
hot and close, dig it now
ooh, that feels good
chorus
oh, my lord!

unbothered by the chaos swirling 'round outside
in your arms is where i want 2 live and die
someplace where your face is all that i see
where the love we make intoxicates intensively
in a mirror where your sweet reflection used 2 be
there is hope, there is joy, my soul sanctuary
my soul sanctuary
loving u in silence, neverending kiss
under your gaze i can peacefully exist
sanctuary, baby, nothing compares 2 this
in my darkest hour u can be my bliss 
all of me i give 2 thee down at your feet
the reassurance in your rhythm speaks 2 me
over and over your screams are like a prayer
in the dark, u are there , my soul sanctuary
ooh, my soul sanctuary
loving u in passion unmolested in this garden
mango and nectarine, sweet honeydew, i beg your pardon
my mouth runneth over from ecstasy
it's true , baby, i love the taste of u
loving u in silence, knowing that it's right
under your gaze i ponder this love 2night
unbothered by the chaos swirling around outside
in your arms is where i wanna live and die

"p**** p**** 
uh, yeah
uh
good mornin' ladies and gentlemen
boys and motherf***in' girls
this is your captain with no name speakin'
and i'm here 2 rock your world
with a tale that will soon be classic
about a woman u already know
no prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
p**** control
chorus:
aaah, p**** control, oh
aaah, p**** control, oh
our story begins in a schoolyard
a little girl skipping rope with her friends
a tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
just school books 4 the fight she would be in
one day over this hoodie
she got beat 4 some clothes and a rep
with her chin up, she scolded &quot;all y'all's molded
when i'm rich, on your neck i will step
and step she did 2 the straight a's
then college, a master degree
she hired the heifers that jumped her
and made everyone of them work 4 free?
no! why?
so what if my sisters are triflin'?
they just don't know
she said &quot;mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'girl, u need p**** control'&quot;
chorus
verse 2
p**** got bank in her pockets
before she got d*** in her drawers
if brother didn't have good 'n' plenty of his own
in love p**** never did fall
and this fool named trick wanna stick her
uh, talkin' more shit than a b****
'bout how he gonna make p**** a star
if she come and sing a lick on his hit
p**** said &quot;n****, u crazy if u don't know
every woman in the world ain't a freak u can go platinum 4 times
still couldn't make what i make in a week so push up on somebody that wanna hear that
cuz this somebody here don't wanna know boy, u better act like u understand
when u roll with p**** control&quot;
chorus
breakdown
 
with one more verse 2 the story
i need another piece of your ear
i wanna hip u all 2 the reason
i'm known as the player of the year
cuz i met this girl named p****
at the club   international balls she was rollin' 4 deep
3 sisters and a weepy eyed white girl drivin' a hog
i pulled up right beside her
and my electric top went down i said &quot;motherf***er, i know your reputation
and i'm astounded that u're here
i fear u're lonely and u want 2 know a 12 o'clock straight up n****
that don't give a shit that u're p**** control
well i'm that n****, at least i wanna be
but it's gonna be hard as hell 2 keep my mind off a body
that would make every rich man want 2 sell, sell, sell
can i tell u what i'm thinkin' that u already know?
u need a motherf***er that respects your name&quot;
now say it, p**** control
chorus
and the moral of this motherf***er is
ladies, make'em act like they know
u are, was, and always will be p**** control
aaah, p**** control, oh
peace and be wild
say what, huh?
oh no, don't u think about callin' her a ho
u juvenile delinquent
best sit your ass down
talkin' about p**** control
huh, can u dig it?
aaah, p**** control, oh

bathe with me
let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
bathe with me
let's kiss with one synonymous notion
that nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
when the 2 r in love
l.o.v.e.   l.o.v.   can u hear me?
when 2 r in love
their bodies shiver at the mere contemplation
of penetration let alone the actual act
when 2 r in love
the thought of his tongue in the v of her love
in his mind, this thought it leads the pack
come bathe with me
let's drown each other in each others emotions
bathe with me
let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
bathe with me
let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
bathe with me
let's kiss with one synonymous notion
that nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
when the 2 r in love
 in love   can u hear me?"

"tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
just after i wiped away his last tear
i guess he's better off than he was before
a whole lot better off than the fools he left here
i used to cry for tracy
'cause he was my only friend
those kind of cars don't pass you every day
i used to cry for tracy
'cause i want to see him again
but sometimes, sometimes life ain't always the way
sometimes it snows in april
sometimes i feel so bad
sometimes i wish that life was never ending
and all good things, they say, never last
springtime was always my favorite time of year
a time for lovers holding hands in the rain
now springtime only reminds me of tracy's tears
always cry for love, never cry for pain
he used to say so strong unafraid to die
unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
no, staring at his picture i realized
no one could cry the way my tracy cried
sometimes it snows in april
sometimes i feel so bad
sometimes i wish that life was never ending
and all good things, they say, never last
i often dream of heaven and i know that tracy's there
i know that he has found another friend
maybe he's found the answer to all the april snow
maybe one day i'll see my tracy again
sometimes it snows in april
sometimes i feel so bad
sometimes i wish that life was never ending
and all good things, they say, never last
all good things, they say, never last
and love, it isn't love until it's past"

taking care of one another
you and me

for everything you got comes from his hand
food, water, the clothes you wear
how many of y'all n****s really care?
to care let's define this word n**** someone who stays high watching their life go by someone content with riding behind n****
they come in all colors
white, black, puerto rican
is that the main n****s we're speakin' about?
wear suits and buy and sell corporations
with only one thing in mind
that is the destruction of the so called radical man

where will you be in 2045?
30 million people right now, are being wiped off the face of the planet by

what eye got to share is mighty good news
a brand new day is dawning

black muse we've been so abused
our mothers were good looking and our fathers were to
but if they don't stay together
we can't walk no better in these shoes
long ago two men held one of us down
another took a whip and made a terrible sound
baby watched her father falling down to the ground
that was you and me
black muse can eye share with you
just came this morning and it's mighty good news
they tipped the hour glass
now everything is passed
it's true
they gave the world back to you and me
the faces on the mountains and a dirty sea
a trillion dollar bill and no currency
still we believe
black muse we gonna make it through
surly people that created rhythm and blues
rock and roll and jazz
so you know we're built to last

like a ufo sighting
from my heart eye am writing
the next close encounter
tell me how long
will it be on land or near the water
will it produce the sun or the black moon daughter
or a pillow covered with all our tears
1000 light years away from here
1000 light years away from here
no yesterday or tomorrow
no better remedy for sorrow
or why the 5th held forever will make you cry
eye don't know why
1000 light years from here
two unbroken circles joined together make a butterfly
little darling don't you wanna try?
there ain't nothing better than looking for me
and seeing you
seeing you in the mirror
1000 light years away from here
why do we always seem so far away?
when you know that eye really wanna be with you night and day
i'm running out of ways to say how

circle of amore
10th grade central in september
that was a year i remember
on this chilly cold afternoon
i overheard the gang in the locker room
rendezvous, mary's house
dirty words and wine
needless 2 say they all spend the day
just counting time, counting time
halfway through her history class
denise she kindly raised her hand and asked
if she could be excused then she ran from school  in a hurry,
the other girls, ooh they knew
this is what friends are really 4
mary, claire, denise and belle
circle of amore
circle of amore
imagination showed a window on a cold september day leaves are brown , passion sounds memory self astray
4 hands in the place where the feet connect
circle of sex
in the vicious race 2 maturity
they're almost phased from ecstasy
sweat upon the necks of dames
loser in the circle game
cause memorie's r worth so much more mary, claire, denise and belle

as though awakened from a dream,

but nowaday, i find that it's reflective
of what i see goin' down everyday
my brothers and my sisters gettin' played
so we revert 2 committin' dope, many brothers get hurt
by another brother who don't like salt in his dirt

i am here for you
love is meant for two
now tell me what you're gonna do
if i gave you diamonds and pearls
would you be a happy boy or a girl
if i could i would give you the world
but all i can do is just offer you
my love
which one of us is right
if we always fight
why can't we just let love decide
am i the weaker man
because i understand
that love must be the master plan

confuse the rainbow children and dethron their king. using the lies promoted
by the whosepapers, hellavisions, and scagazines  the banished ones
constructed a digital garden around the palace that extended throughout the
world. furthermore they demanded compensation 4 their time spent in the
palace b4 the exile. this was noise! ""so be it,"" said the wise one, and
gladly obliged with an invisible deed. the banished ones accepted and
returned to their place of birth in mendacity. as 4 the rainbow children,

slight electrical shock. please select the race history u desire. u have
selected african american. this is your history:
first of all, the term ""black and white"" is a fallacy. it simply is another
way of saying ""this or that"". let's examine the term ""this or that"" in its
ultimate form which is: ""this"" means the truth or ""that which is resistant 2
it. when a minority realizes its similarities on a higher level  not just
""black""  but people of color, and higher still ""indigenous"", and even higher
still, ""from the tribe of."", and yet higher  the ""rainbow children"". when
this understanding comes, the so called minority becomes a majority in the
wink of an eye. this action will cause a reaction or resistance. the source
of this resistance must b banished as it is in direct conflict with the
initial action. it cannot be assimilated, 4 its very nature is resistance.
in other words, one cannot serve 2 masters. u r either ""this"" or ""that""
which is not ""this"".

even though his might get broken
who's the guilty one when there ain't no judge or jury?
shadow 2 the sun, next 2 the one
hell ain't got no fury
it will approach us, the debt he's been in
open to the heart in need of mending
will this song have a happy ending?
only the woman knows, only she knows
2 sides 2 every story
one man's gloom is another man's glory
sun 2 a shadow, rose 2 a thorn

4 that matter, whatever 2 make u reconsider
is there truth when u make love 2 a lie?
excuse me, but is this really goodbye?
why'd i ever let u in this morning?
why'd i let u come inside my door?
i should have known without that smile adorning
your face   a kiss was not what u came 4
that's when your hand reached out 2 touch me gently
at least that's how it happened in my mind

can't begin 2 understand how i think about u everything i wanna do, i cannot do without u
however wrong u want   i'll be
just please  don't leave if it means this life without u, baby
i swear i'll spend it on my knees
excuse me, but is this really goodbye?
last night when i left u i was so sure
we'd be 2gether 4ever and 4 days
and now my shade of blue couldn't get no bluer
i don't even know what i did 2 make u go away
i could possibly stage a front and play the cool one heart in my hand tryin' 2 hold back every cry
but who would applaud me when it's u, my one and only
who ever gave me a good reason not 2 die
excuse me, but is this reallyâ€¦ excuse me, but is this reallyâ€¦ excuse me, but is this really goodbye?

there came a sound that enters the mind
through a door that's deep in your soul
through every pore of your body it goes
and in a light too bright to behold
is a truth more shiny than gold
and as sure as this candle burns
every soul must return
into the light, into the light
from out of the light there comes a story...
open your mind, and feel the glory
what's the hurry to die without trying?
if you could sell your worries would anyone buy 'em? and for every flower that grows, even a baby knows
that as sure as the candle burns
every soul must return
into the light, into the light"

""you can hardly be aware
how i suffer from the heat

if we took a little walk
we might have a little talk!
pray let us take the air!""
said the table to the chair 
said the chair to the table
""now you know we are not able! how foolishly you talk
when you know we cannot walk!"" said the table with a sigh
""it can do no harm to try i've as many legs as you
why can't we walk on two?"" 
so they both went showly down and walked about the town
with a cheerful bumpy sound as they toddled round and round
and everybody cried
as they hastened to their side ""see the table and the chair
have come 2 take the air!"" 
but in going down an alley
to a castle in the valley
they completely lost their way
and wandered all the day
till, to see them safely back
they paid a ducky quack
and a beetle and a mouse
who took them to their house.
when they whispered to each other
""o delightful little brother! what a lovely walk we've taken!
let us dine on beans and bacon!""
so the ducky and the little browny  mousey and the beetle dined,
and danced upon the heads
till they toddled to their beds. good god

the songs were a year long
and had been playing 4 months
when he walked in2 the place
no one seemed 2 care
an introverted distant look on most of their faces
upon the mic repeating 2 words over and over again
was this woman he had never noticed b4
he lost himself in the articulated manner
in which she said them
these 2 words
a little bit behind the beat
i mean just enough 2 turn u on
4 every time she said the words
another 1 of his doubts were gone
should he try 2 rap 2 her?
should he stand and stare?
no one else was watching her
she didn't seem 2 care
so over and over she said the words
'til he could take no more
he dragged her from the stage
and 2gether they ran thru the back door
in the alley over by the curb
he said, ""tell me what's ur name?""
she only said the words again
and it started 2 rain
2 words falling between the drops
and the moans of his condition
holding someone is truly believing
there's joy in repetition
there's joy in repetition

in the background, along with a sqeaking bed
throughout)
this is 4 the cab u want 2 drive and run it all,
this is 4 why i wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall,
this is 4 politicians, who were born 2 believe in war,
this one... yeah that's for me, that's who that one's 4
this is 4 discremination, and egotistic things supreme,
this one's 4 whoever taught u how 2 kiss in designer jeans,
oh, that one's for, that one's for, where u have 2 live,
this one's 4 the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy...
the ones who don't know how 2 give
this one's 4 yosemite sam, and the tourists at disneyland,
this one, ooooh, yeah, that's the one
that's 4, that's 4, the creator of man
this one's 4 the sun, moon, stars...tourists at disneyland
this one's 4 the ocean, the sea, the shore...
this one's 4....and that's 4 u, that's who that one's 4,
this is 4 the women, who r so beautifully complex,
this is 4 the love, not sex,
this is 4 the wind, who blows no matter how fast or slow
not knowing where i'm going is galaxies better
than not having a place to go, now i know
serious music or ""the bridge""

the moon wasn't shinin' nowhere
sometimes that old light in the alley would light up this old heart of mine
but now i'm wonderin' if there's someone up there who really cares
the night fell darkest in persia
what used 2 flow blue is now flowin' black
many a doctor can try, but only heaven knows why
when it comes 2 love
why do some men, why do some men turn their backs?
can't somebody please tell me?
maybe the morning air will make me feel better
oh, i hope better than i feel right now
last night a stranger took my picture and then he, uh..
he asked if i'd buy it, huh
i said i guess i don't know how

the everlasting one
the one who came from nothing
and yet from this one, everything comes
the one who commands ur momma
with the simple phrase ""i am""
and every time that she obeys
she gives birth 2 the son of man
who is this?
reproduction of the new breed leader/stand up and organize!
reproduction of the new breed leader/stand up and organize!
the agreement 
with every birth, we keep it so/never changing one piece of it
in fear of what would unfold/the scales would then become unbalanced
and thus would begin the fall/the sin of one would become
the sin of one and all

rise, rainbow children, rise
rise, rainbow children, rise

held fast in his belief that the lord would bring him another one who loved him so."

that's when i saw her, ooh, i saw her
she walked in through the out door, out door
she wore a
raspberry beret
the kind u find in a second hand store
raspberry beret
and if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
raspberry beret
i think i love her
built like she was
she had the nerve 2 ask me
if i planned 2 do her any harm
so, look here
i put her on the back of my bike
and a we went riding
down by old man johnson's farm
i said now, overcast days never turned me on
but something about the clouds and her mixed
she wasn't 2 bright
but i could tell when she kissed me
she knew how 2 get her kicks
she wore a
raspberry beret
the kind u find in a second hand store
raspberry beret
and if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
raspberry beret
i think i love her
the rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
and the horses wonder who u are
thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
u feel like a movie star
listen
they say the first time ain't the greatest
but i tell ya
if i had the chance 2 do it all again
i wouldn't change a stroke
'cause baby i'm the most
with a girl as fine as she was then

is that nobody ever wins

just matters how each one ends

is they never do what they say 1 minute they want peace then do everything 2 make it go away
dropping bombs on each other
in the act of saving face
tell me now people how is that resolution?
either u do or u don't
either u will or u won't
making amends is a difficult pill 2 swallow
what can we lose if we try ?

if u love it like ur best friend
handle ur heart with care
it's as delicate as a wing

they look at life through a pocket camera... what? no flash again?
they're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that love is bad
half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
mama, are u listening?
we need a new breed    leaders, stand up, organize
don't let your children watch television until they know how to read
or else all they'll know how to do is cuss, fight and breed
no child is bad from the beginning... they only imitate their atmosphere
if they're in the company of tourists, alcohol and us history
what's to be expected is 3 minus 3... absolutely nothing
stand up, organize
we need a new breed...leaders, stand up, organize
i wanna be in the new breed, stand up, organize

through the rain and the thunder
u cried in ecstacy
and u were so kind
i felt sorry 4 all creation
because at the time, no 1 was lucky
no 1 was lucky, no 1 was lucky as me
and now u're gone and i just wanna be still
so silent, i'll just let my senses sleep
it's gonna be so hard 2 hear my voice

"it was 7:45 we were all in line
to greet the teacher miss cathleen
first was kevin, then came lucy, third in line was me
all of us were ordinary compared to cynthia rose
she always stood at the back of the line
a smile beneath her nose
her favourite number was 20 and every single day
if you asked her what she had for breakfast
this is what she'd say
starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam
butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
and a side order of ham
if you set your mind free, baby
maybe you'd understand
starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam
cynthia wore the prettiest dress
with different colour socks
sometimes i wondered if the mates were in her lunch box
me and lucy opened it when cynthia wasn't around
lucy cried, i almost died, you know what we found?
starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam
butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
and a side order of ham
if you set your mind free, baby
maybe you'd understand
starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam
cynthia had a happy face, just like the one she'd draw
on every wall in every school
but it's all right, it's for a worthy cause
go on, cynthia, keep singing
starfish and coffee
maple syrup and jam
butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
and a side order of ham

no regrets because i forget the unfamiliar faces
those petty lies and alibis, just golddiggas chasing

she worked the night shift
dishwater blonde, tall and fine
she got a lot of tips
well, earlier i'd been talkin' stuff
in a violent room
fighting with lovers past
i needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
dorothy was fast
well, i ordered   ""yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, i ain't 2 hungry""
dorothy laughed
she said ""sounds like a real man 2 me""
kinda cute, u wanna take a bath?
i said ""cool, but i'm leaving my pants on"" ""cuz i'm kind of going with someone""
she said ""sounds like a real man 2 me""
""mind if i turn on the radio?""
""oh, my favorite song"" she said
and it was joni singing ""help me i think i'm falling""
the phone rang and she said
""whoever's calling can't be as cute as u""
right then i knew i was through
my pants where wet, they came off
but she didn't see the movie
cuz she hadn't read the book first
instead she pretended she was blind
an affliction brought on by a witch's curse
dorothy made me laugh i felt much better so i went back
2 the violent room let me tell u what i did...
i took another bubble bath with my pants on
all the fighting stopped
next time i'll do it sooner

if we drown then we'll be delivered
u can still see the picture upon the wall
one eye staring at nothing at all
the other one trying 2 focus through all your tears
u can try and try but there's nothin' 2 hide
u can't run from yourself and what's inside
u got 2 find the answers 2 the questions that u most fear
so over and over u ask your soul
why'd u come down 2 a world so cold?
and the voice inside says 2night the truth will be told
u surrounded yourself with all the wrong faces
spending your time in all the wrong places
puttin' your faith in things that only make u cry
people say they love u when they wanna help
but how can they when u can't help yourself?
the more they say they love u, the more u just wanna die
so here we go again, the self analysis
have another glass of port and uh.. forget this
the band's playin' at the club 2night and they're bound 2 groove
there u are, u think u're high
u can't ask yourself cuz u'd only lie
if u had a dollar 4 every time u tried
u can't call nobody cuz they'll tell u straight up
come and make love when u really hate 'em
relationships based on the physical are over and done
they're over and done u'd rather have fun
with only one, with only one
only one... one 
and then it hit 'cha like a fist on a wall
who gave u life when there was none at all?
who gave the sun permission 2 rise up everyday? let me tell it if u ask god 2 love u longer
every breath u take will make u stronger
keepin' u happy  and proud 2 call his name jesus 
and over and over u ask your soul
why'd u come down 2 a world so cold?
and the voice inside said 2night the truth will be told
and this time i was listening, hear me
let's go down 2 the holy river
if we drown then we'll be delivered if we don't then we'll never see the light if u die before u try
u'll have 2 come back and face the light when u believe it, u got a good reason 2 cry 
so i went on down 2 the holy river
i called my girl and told her i had something 2 give her
i asked her 2 marry me and she said yes, i cried
oh, that night i drowned in her tears and mine
and.. and instead of a glass of sorrow and wine
looking back y'all, i don't miss nothing except the time
and when i see that picture upon the wall
the one eye staring at nothing at all
my eyes trying 2 focus but these are much different tears
oh, yes they are
let's go down 2 the holy river 
let's go down 2 the holy river "

every charge u make is karma

he said, â€œjust like her mama, uh huh
she shows her body when she wants to show love
she tried that stuff with me and i beat her downâ€
thereâ€™s no way i could let her stay
couldnâ€™t let her stick around
â€˜cause i tried so hard to raise her right
he said, â€œwhat made her turn out this wayâ€
i donâ€™t know
what made her turn out this way
i donâ€™t know, i donâ€™t know
and i said and i said and i said
yo mister howâ€™s your daughter
you really ought to know every thing you taught her
donâ€™t matter when sheâ€™s all alone
she needs you right now mister
she ainâ€™t got long to live
itâ€™s so easy to say, â€œi love himâ€
but itâ€™s hard to forget
yo mister howâ€™s your daughter yo mister howâ€™s your daughter yo mister howâ€™s your daughter yo mister howâ€™s your daughter "

u will be moved when the baby lets out his very first cry
u will be moved when u think of how hard he'll have 2 try
he'll grow up on an empty stomach, but he'll try his best 2 listen
2 the teacher readin' from a schoolbook with half the pages missin'
chorus:
surely when the rain comes, u will be moved
la da da da da
see the video
u will be moved, and u will be when the baby makes all the grades
u will be moved, and u will be when they still don't hire him anyway
moved by a system without one single guarantee
that an education is the answer and love will set us free
chorus
oh, u will be moved when the rain comes, oh yes, u will be moved
when the streets overflow with angry souls, that's when u see the truth
when the pain that u've inflicted comes back on your door 2 roost that's when u'll see the future , but u won't see u
chorus
u will be moved when the whip comes down on the back of one of your own
u will be moved when u look 4 compassion but u find u're all alone
moved, and u will be when u are, that's when u'll know
that the bread u share is better than the blood that your deeds have caused 2 flow
chorus
hey, u will be moved when the rain comes, oh yes, u will be moved
when the streets all flow with angry souls, that's when u'll see the truth
when the pain that u've inflicted comes back on your door 2 roost that's when u'll see the future , but u won't see u
i said surely when the rain comes, u will be moved
la da da da da see the video
hey, surely, surely, surely surely y'all
ow, la da da da da"
"you wanna know if i care for you
you ought to know by now
how can you stand there just pretending
and you know how i feel
'cause baby, you're my love
and i love everything you do to me
you're my love
and i love when you're around
you're my love
and i'll never let you down
you wanna know what i see in you

anyone else before
'cause baby, you're my love
and i love everything you do to me
you're my love
and i love when you're around
you're my love
and i'll never let you down
seasons changing faster than they do
when we were young
it's funny but we didn't seem to care
the only thing we cared about
was keeping our love strong
as long as you're there
i'll always care
'cause you're my love
and i love everything you do to me
you're my love
and i love when you're around
you're my love
and i'll never let you down
'cause you're my love
and i love everything you do to me
you're my love
and i love when you're around
you're my love
and i'll never let you down
'cause you're my love
and i love everything you do to me
you're my love
and i love when you're around
you're my love
and i'll never let you down"
