how to love
how to love
for a second you were here
why you over there?
its hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
like you never had a love

when you was just a young'un your looks was so precious
but now your grown up
so fly it's like a blessing
but you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
without you being insecure
you never credit yourself so when you got older
it's seems like you came back 10 times over
now you're sitting here in this damn corner
looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

why you over there?
it's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
like you never had a love
had a love
you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
the fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
but it wasn't your fault
wasn't in your intentions
to be the one here talking to me
be the one listening
but i admire your poppin bottles and dippin'
just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
baby, so don't be mad
nobody else trippin

that you deserve the best

now fab, spit at these n****s
and let them know why they ain't f***in with you
your goddamn right i'm feeling myself
a chauffeur no sir, i'm wheeling myself
looking for a chick chilling for self
so i can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
i'm having problems dealing with wealth
but you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
you n****s must've got a deal for your health
your cd is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
i spend big, at any time i can start splurging
the twin sigs open chests like a heart surgeon
and i'm buttoned up, i'm just a blue collar crook
but i keep a stack thick as few college books
i got a new polished look
and twenty dime b****es, to show y'all n****s how my two dollars look
the boy's got at least six digits on
so the guns gotta be at least midget long
the money, is like ten bridges long
i throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
i got some good smoke just for puffers
the two grand twenty's make the hustlers suffer
plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
i've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
but nowadays you can't put it past 'em
i got a dan marino arm, i'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
and the n****s in the hood keep quoting my lines
i don't jump ship i keep floating in mine
long as i keep toting i'm fine
i'ma have these d*** sucking n****s deep throating the nine
i jumped in the english ship, benzed whip
it's terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
i'm reading scripts no, not the penmanship the box office shit , i box off this b**** jessica alba, kirsten dunst
and still make a mil' on the first of months
these dudes be the first to front
'til they family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
i'm in the top position, i can make you a proposition
i'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
to hell with the patience
i'ma send a n**** down under like australia vacations
yeah it is what it is
my n****s just killed y'all and i'mma close the casket
i'm tryin not to let this industry get the best of me y'all
i work hard in the game, the game's stressing me y'all
all they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
from the hood to hollywood they respecting me y'all
and even overseas they accepting me y'all
all the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
i get a lot of dirty money so respect me or fall
but i'm saving all my checks, i'm investing 'em all
they say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
even the stars, but success is my destiny y'all
look, i cook tracks i got the recipe y'all
you can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all
at the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all
i got broads crying trying to get next to me y'all
i got broads craving begging to have sex with me y'all
screaming, ""cass you don't know how sexy you are!""
and i'm happy i'm alive, god's blessing me y'all
and all the problems that arrive is god testing me y'all
so i pray everyday but i ain't praying too much
cause i be sinning everyday so i ain't praying enough
and we all could be beat, and i ain't saying i'm tough
but if it's beef i don't speak, i ain't saying ""what's up""
if it's beef when we meet then i'm spraying shit up
prraat prraat. i ain't saying too much and that's that
cause that cat you embracing with love
might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
cause the folks you call friends tend to envy the most
some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
but sometimes you gotta give 'em the nine and let 'em stink
you can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
i'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
as soon as your eyes shut, them n****s will ride up
and the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
and we all gotta die but, i ain't ready to leave
that's why even if it's petty i'll be ready to squeeze
but put a cheddar in cheese, the guac a moola
i pop the ruger, send that hot shit through ya!
like booya! that's the sound when the pound busting
ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
i try to only resort to violence if i have to
but man n****s out here are playing fair
so before the odds even i'm leaving them laying there
and i ain't even playing believe what i'm saying here
cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
and found in a hole in the grass
for trying to play that thug role i'll stomp a mud hole in your ass

"big tymers, n****
i got that work, n****
look, look, listen:
this is where them n****s die fast
sell bricks and buy bags
they dodge class to hit the block and go find cash
if you try to pass take my advice: drive fast
cause, my man, ain't no escaping when shots blast
you wonder why the cops keep circling
n****s murdering
i ain't never saw 'em before
tonight we twurkin' 'em
n****s wearin' masks like glasses
n****s got on tank tops and a pair of reebok classics
pants to my knees cause the glock make it slouch
i can't talk right now i got three rocks in my mouth
and, wodie, when we enter n****s freeze up like it's winter
and if a n**** whisper, pistols eat him up for dinner
seventeen representer you don't like it, do somethin'
and i'll bet you'll see a n**** outside 'bout two somethin'
and we like to dress in all black up in my residence
ain't got on no suits cause we ain't tryin' to be presidents
n****, we done moved more coke, than a n**** could know
more money, more cars, than a n**** could show
and more ice cheap price,than a n**** could score
and hit blocks with glocks, make 'em get on the floor
n**** waking up to alley cats and rats
project b****es that tote gats
n****s kicking the dope, but the crack done smack back
lil' n****s runnin' through the hallways
while other n****s playin' ball made a court in the driveway
things ain't the same where i use to play
it's guns and broads
new cars, neighborhood superstars
and hoes smoking cigars
lil' ones sitting on the car
watchin' the bus hollering
""them people comin!"" when that blue car pull up
i'm tired of catchin' cuts, and bendin' corners
i got that work got youngsters on all four corners
you got the quarters, and you got them halves
i got the quarter ki's, and fresh got the slabs
ten a ki is the price if you want a brick
and if you don't know that, n**** tax the b****
it's the return of the click clackin'
downtown pistol packin'
y'all remember me from back in the '89 era
when killers use to wear mascara
and run through the court causin' terror
random riot gunshots
government issued glocks
that's bakin' soda added with that odour now you got clatch pots
n****s went from  to frozen cups
to catchin' cuts, to big ole nuts
shorty, i been on missions
jackin' n****s for balley competitions
stickin' guns in bustas' backs
everybody, come out your polos and your zodiacs
but that was back in the days
see, n****s done changed they ways
went from snug nose 38's to hand grenades
now it's a must that n****s bust back when they get cussed at
or fussed at
nine millimeters, glocks, pumps, riot guns, n****s can trust that
y'all got to understand
we got this shit on lock, wodie
if you ain't makin' money you ain't doin' what you suppose to
i understand n****s kickin' in doors for twenty inch momo's
whatever it take, lil' daddy
and it don't matter
if i get caught up in a struggle, i got to take mines
if you get caught up, you better believe it
that that iron gon' get your mind right, dog
we hustlin' for sure, fa
bling blingin' without a doubt

underground shit, i see myself as a seed
living in the glass, and everybody's looking
how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
this current affairs, but who the hell cares?
everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs

i'm good, i pray for a head to protect ya
and i gotta walk the streets with the heat as my protection
still gotta watch my back, still watch my front home
cause i seen a lot of n****s die with they gun on
so with that in mind, i just get higher
and pray to the higher messiah, i'm no liar
and they say that puffing the fire f***s with your memory
but i got a lot of stuff that i don't wan' remember see
like when my homie ivin died

never seen my pops cry 'til i seen my grams died
and i'm here to tell him that i miss my grams too
and i wish i could hug her for mothers day too
and i feel the same way that you do
but we gotta still move on so she can just smile down on us
and i don't want the lord to ever frown down on us
i know that they really got power in a gun
but i also know that they got power in a tongue
so every time i speak, look i try to speak life
y'all tweaking for broads, i tweak life
they said i was s'posed to die as a fetus
my momma said i bind that devil in the name of jesus
so now i'm here just to talk to y'all
come and stroll with me homie, let me walk wit' y'all
ten million ways to die so i chose
to get my life right by the end of the road
'fore my body in a casket and i'm stiff and froze
'fore i'm laying in a morgue with a tag on my toes
i'm here to tell you take heed to the warnings
school shootings, hurricanes, and global warming
open ya bibles up with no hesitation
bc was the genesis, this is revelations
so you better pick your destination
tomorrow ain't promised, better pick your destination
rest in peace b spencer, rest in peace ?
shit could be worse so i'm feeling like weezy
i wake up in the morning, take a piss, and wash my hands
take a knee and thank the
man and leave my life in god's hands, yea!

i grew up where them people called them people on us

grindin all day like we got sleep insomnia
livin like the videos write a treatment on us
stuck in the hood like they poured semen on us
ghetto birds still shittin on us, government still quittin on us
lost a few homies and the grief still sittin on us
so we got the names written on us, white folks still spittin on us
and them b**** ass police k 9's teeth still grittin on us
but we smoke, ashes still gettin on us
older b****es still hittin on us
i remember well, beezy roll the l
beezy aint here... wheres beezy at?... beezy got killed
and that was my n****, i go way back for my n****
but i know thats how it happend my n****,

last time we seen him was when katrina hated
found his body like a month later, rest in peace boy

and his daughter is a princess, this shit is harder than a bench press
but ima keep goin, and i swear i got a lump in my throat
but ima keep on pumpin the flow,
so if i cry dont stop the beat, i feel like my heart just stopped the beat
my n**** lil derek is quick to cop a key, either that or load the gat and go pop a g
and because of that hes just a name in a rhyme of mine
i pray his family and his mama is fine
so much shit just sit on this mind of mine

i smoke back to back
cause if my thoughts got to me id be in this rap
or id be in the can, thank god i had dreams of being the man
yea and f*** a man with a badge cause he aint shit to a man on the edge
the five o killed naughty good boy dead

shot em up face down on the lawn
not to mention with his handcuffs on
not to mention they had plain clothes on
and the complain goes on
but no body do nothin bout it

and haters at an all time high
everybody got their hatas like a f***in ipod
shit and they tried to burn my phantom up, but i got my gun license
i got my hammers up, im ready to shoot like a camera
stay still mothaf***a ima have to write my will this summer
cause if they dont kill me, ima kill this summer
yea
and you can put that on my late father or my late grandmother
ms. mercedes carter
or my grandfather larry bosock the old man hustle till his heart stopped
and all i know of my real pops is that he had money
no bank account, that brown paper bag money
yea he might hit me off wit a little brag money
but the n**** still wouldnt be a dad for me
but look how i turned out i hope he glad for me
but thats why when i see him i act mad funny cause hes a joke to me
dont message, dont call, dont talk to me
its just me and my moma how its suppose to be
and i make sure she paid like she wrote for me
and i know she gets all hope for me
and i dont ever want to see her mope for me
hopefully but truthfully there is a day thats due for me

nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand
pardon my g, but i'm one of a kind
been shot two times, here to put it in a rhyme
slow lane, move the coupe like a 5
if i get pulled over, b**** i'm gon' do time
and i know my n****z love me, but they can't do mine
so i gotta be smart, get bread or get behind
get lost or get in line

"baby understand me now
if sometimes you see that i'm mad
don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
when everything goes wrong, you see some bad
but i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
o lord please don't let me be misunderstood
misunderstood aint gotta be explained
but you don't understand me so let me explain
stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
please slow down hurricane
the wind blow, my dreads swang
he had hair like wool, like wayne
dropping ashes in the bible
i shake em out and they fall on the rifle
scary, hail mary no tale fairy

perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle
my god is my judge, no gown no gavel
i'm a rebel, down to battle
now or never, i would never ???
f**king fantastic, f**k if you agree
but i don't give a f**k if you see me
i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
o lord please don't let me be misunderstood
what's understood aint gotta be explained
so for those who understand meet dwayne
for 8 and a half months i gave ms. cit da pain
now it's young money baby, keep the change
my mama say f**k em and we the same
so hello mothaf**ka you got some sheets to change
and aint it funny how people change like easter sunday
you know church fit then outfit,
bright pink and green chest look house lit
bright pinky rings but that aint about this
what you bout b****
excuse my french emotion in my passion
but i wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
what are you asking, if i don't have the answer
it's probably on the web, like i'm a damn tarantula
but i know you don't understand, cuz you thought lil wayne is weezy
but weezy is dwayne
i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
o lord please don't let me be misunderstood
i was watching t.v. the other day right
got this white guy up there talking about black guys
talking about how young black guys are targeted
targeted by who? america
you see one in every 100 americans are locked up
one in every 9 black americans are locked up
and see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
the money we spend on sending a mothaf**ka to jail
a young mothaf**ka to jail
would be less to send his or her young ass to college
see, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
our jails are populated with drug dealers, you know crack/cocaine stuff like that
meaning due to the laws we have on crack/cocaine and regular cocaine
police are only, i don't want to say only right, but shit
only logic by riding around in the hood all day
and not in the suburbs
because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
and you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where i'm going
but why bring a mothaf**ka to jail if it's not gon stand up in court
cuz this drug aint that drug, you know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that
i guess it's all a misunderstanding
i sit back and think, you know us young mothaf**kas you know that 1 in 9
we probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
and it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have
why? i really don't wanna know the answer
i guess we just misunderstood hunh
you know we don't have room in the jail now for the real mothaf**kas, the real criminals
sex offenders, rapists serial killers
don't get scared, don't get scared
i know you saw one them sex offenders papers
don’t trip he live right on the end of yo block,
mhm yea, that n**** live right down the street from you,
sex offender on the level 3 drug,
convicted ex con
yea check em out
watch you got, you got a daughter, son , what you got.?
hahaa yea, you know what
that’s the good weed,
you know what, i have a f**king daughter
you understand me and why the f**k would you bring my neighbor to jail
jus because the reason why he live next door to me, ain’t the reason i live next door to him
meaning he didn’t rap his way to my f**king neighborhood
he sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
you move him out bring him to jail for life
and then you move in with a sex offender
ahaha, hey give me a paper,
ahaha is that a misunderstanding because i didn’t understand it
another thing, let me take my glasses off
cause i wanna see the reaction on there faces when i say this
ha ha, this is why i don’t respect you and nobody like ya
see you’re the type that gets off on getting on other people
that’s not good
no homo,
rather unhuman, i should say
i mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity
rather to me is helping one another
no matter your color or race
but this guy and people like him, they’d rather speculate before they informate
if that’s a word, ha haahha you know spec before check
anyways meaning id much rather
you talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one
just my thought of good humanity mr. sharpton, hold on i aint finished with you man
na f**k that shit mhm hold on, um,
mr. sharp ton and anyone like you, you don’t know me
so if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me
are what ever i do is totally casper the friendly ghost
to me and it doesn’t make you a good person to criticize before you improvise
doesn’t necessarily make you a bad person either but the characteristics for heavenly into bads way, ahah but since i am human i am good and bad, as well but i try my hardest to stay good
threes other things i do and say may be bad or just not to good
but i do try, so with that said i don’t vote you, i mean your only human, good or bad
but i also don’t respect you and i don’t care if that’s good or bad
you see you are no mlk you are no jesse jackson, you are nobody, to me, your just another don king, with a perm, hahah just a little more political, and that just means you’re a little unhuman
then use humans, and now let me be human and say, f**k al sharpton and anyone like him
f**k if you understand me
i love being misunderstood
haha why?,
cause i live in the suburbs
but i come from the hood
bring the hook in."

"i
i'm way more fly than you
i'll take your dime from you
now she wanna spend all night with me
let me be the one that you throw it to, baby
i'd like to spend the rest of my night with you
i'll take your b**** give her back; take your b**** again
that's because you throw a 5 i pitch a 10
now she wanna get inside of me 66
she sees that my wrist is blue and yellow like michigan
she say she love her man she misses him
but nobody do it better than her distance d*** i'm her long distance pimp
when i land my b****es want for me on the strip and i don't lie i confess, i'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress
gotta dress to impess though, gotta stay clean, plus momma in a lex 4
she with me, what you expect, i live to be fly to death
it's the bird man jr. sincerely yours
when it rains it pours, when it rain it whores
now why you wanna go do that
i can see through that
tattoo right there like i view that
girl what that say, what who that
bet he was lame, bet he lil' wayne cus i'm way more flyer
have you hanging round a bunch of yayo buyers and not a day go by us, we don't get high than the telephone wires
cut your telephone we riding where phones don't roam they don't even come on
you're far from home so leave it alone
you creeping with the king of the throne
you sleeping in a tee and a thong
with your hair in a pony
i ain't got no blinds we can stare at the morning but i can't be there all morning
girl i'm a pimp, i'm going, going, going, gone
i'm sorry i was grooving
gotta love that laid back mannie fresh music
but let's get back to what we were doing
laid back in that black on plat ewing's
that's 33 tires he fire
these streets ain't papaya ma
you gotta keep heat on your side
2 must
so i'm a get 3 more and cop you one
wait, naw hun cus you ain't exempt
if your ass ever trip i'll give you a clip but i love the way your jeans suck in your hip
and you walk kinda mean how you strut with a dip
and you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips
but i can't fall for you cus i stick to the scrip i said i stick to my grip; i stick to my money, that's life to me
sorry honey jazze
so how bout you yea
so how bout you
see what i'm talking bout sweet heart you ain't even gotta have john madden
you ain't gotta have d*** vitale, you ain't gotta lee carsole
you ain't gotta have stuart scott, you ain't gotta have linda cohn
know what i'm talking bout, you ain't gotta have the staff of espn
you ain't gotta have abc staff just to talk sports baby cus i got game
just f*** with the boy and i'll get you a jersey
what you want me to put on the back
daddy's little girl that's right, see what i'm talking bout
i can't give you the game but i can show the game
and you can see what you see and peek how you peek and see what you get

but i chose my own life so i gradually accept it
i'm influenced and effected by the way it became
and i don't play with them at all so i don't say its a game
and even though i grew up hard and i have gracefully change
i'm always street so i'll forever be facin a change
and i'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
and i demand respect from all if not then i'm waisten a man
and if i want it then i get and if i need it i have it
take care of them family first busta look weed is a habit
and i'm so often i'm congratulated for the succeced at last
but when they turn they back i just have jesus leadin my path
and i didn't ask for you to like me i don't care if you hate me
but don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me

the toilet start flushing
try to avoid the confrontin', the joy, the consumption
where outside noises seduction, it's harder to function
look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
they told me that i know that i'm wrong, but i don't know what's right
goddamn
you must hate me
love me or leave me
she love me or leave me, i gave her a reason
she don't want a reason, she don't wanna see me
she don't wan' believe me
i tell her that's cold, i'm already freezin'

and they demolished that invention

the future
i know i know they cant f*** with me cuz i cant f*** wit my damn self
i know i know they cant f*** with me cuz i cant f*** wit my damn self
... is is mack mane
i got the hart of a king the blood of a slave
feel like i did it before the second time to the grave
but it one life to live thats why im getting paid
off a flow that priceless i just got it appraised
spit like i need a raise
blaze as i gaze
at the stars and ask the lord
why the culprits at the mall pimp
it make me sick to my stomic
thats why i rap
like a pregnant woman i dont spit i vomit
so pay homage me and wayne to g's
like 20 hundreds and we keep the semis blunted
and we live like brothers from another
so f*** with him and mack gon react like you did me somethin
thats a hint to you david throwin shots at goliath
this the new testament where the victor is the giant
so you should get the weight and lose you hate
remember males shouldn't be jelious thats a female trait"
"i stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
good wasn't home so i settled for better
i'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
so i guess i gotta work with the little bit i got
now i'm like ""hey, i like the view from here!""
i'm so high i can't see you from here
both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
and these b****es just looking for a daddy
p**** getting problems, can't live without 'em
the weed too loud, turn up the volume
richer than a b****, but i can't buy tomorrow
that's why i go hard, ho
god bless the world, and most people in it
it's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
mona lisa smile, that b**** barely grinning
take you off the face of the earth like a blemish
we wen't from boyz to menace, menace ii society
now we get higher, call that shit karate
blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
smoke so much good, i don't even have a bad side
yeah, i got a p**** hangover
b****es eat me up like my name is russell stover
murder the perception, make 'em get it right
if i'm flirting with perfection, i'm f***ing her that night
i'm a southerner delight, louisiana pride
the belly of the beast, it ate me alive
tell them b****es they'll never take me alive
and today, i took a walk outside and...
uh, and we all kiss our mamas
cuz promises are broken but tomorrow isn't promised
think i'm gettin' sick, i'm feelin' illegal
and not having money is the root of all evil
life is a midget, so try to live it up
it's doctor carter, b****, i got this shit nipped and tucked
if these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
i need some wallpaper before they start to fuss
yea, pick up the phone and call your bluff
human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
i don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
motherf***er i don't shoot ya, b**** i shoot ya up
i ain't like these n****s, i don't like these n****s
i just roll another joint like spike lee n****
and i woke up this morning, got the coal out my eyes
and then i took a walk outside and..."
"yea.yea.yea.yea
this is the carter muthaf***a, yea
and in my building i must keep it real
and man i miss the times, we would shine, you would keep on your side

'cause we have nothin' in common since i done became star
i done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
one touch, i could make the drapes and the sheers change
and show me the city that i without fear claim
what i set seems to never extinguish
coolest kid out, baby, word to chuck inglish
count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
my song is your girlfriend's waking up ringer
heh, or alarm, or whatever
she be here at six in the morn' if i let her
but i never get attracted to fans
'cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
i always knew that i could figure
how to get these label heads to offer him good figures
and me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'cause them hipsters gon' have to get along
with them hood n****s
it's all good, i'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
rest in peace to heath ledger, but i'm no joker

and every time she talk was like a gold medal speech
intelligent, she shud teach
and if so, i wud be a nerd like screech
i told her i would write a rhyme about her, and it wud be sweet
i said “i need the perfect track,” she said “thas deep”

she said her name was lisa marie
and she was discreet
her picture’s in the dictionary next to elite
i told her we can get away, we can retreat
cut off my arms put em on her seat
cut off my legs, put em on her head
so i can run thru her mind like she does mine
and every time she smile it make me feel like a child
in the supermarket in the candy aisle
i saw a picture of her wit her panties down
i fall asleep and dream i’m a camera now
i would love to be the water in her shower
or one of her bath towels
i told her i would write a rhyme about her, and it wud be sweet
i said “i need the perfect track,” she said “thas deep”

and i think she like butterflies,
because she got one on her upper thigh
and her face is like summertime
birthday the same month of mine,
with a different sign
virgo, i go wherever her go
if she say so, i’m on her like a fur coat
in november she colder than december

looking to find
a way through the day
a life for the night
dear lord, you've done took so many of my people
but i'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
like what the hell am i doing right?
i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73
before i eva had a multi platinum sellin' cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a coupla months
my f***** father must've had his panties up in a
bunch
'cause he split, i wonder if he even kissed me
goodbye
no i don't, on second thought i just f***in' wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldnt picture leaving her
side,
even if i hated kim, i'd grit my teeth and i'd try to make it work
wit her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human but i'm man enough to face 'em
today
what i did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets outta that gun
cause i'd of killed 'em shit i woulda shot kim and
them both
it's my life, i'd like to welcome ya'll to the eminem show
and i'm grindin' til i'm tired

but i'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
like what the hell am i doing right?
no more games, i'ma change what you call rage
tear this mothaf***in roof off like 2 dogs caged
i was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed
i been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the fact
that i can't get by with my 9 to 5
and i can't provide the right type of life for my
family
cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
and it's no movie, there's no mekhi phifer, this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's getting even
harder
tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
see dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima
donna
baby mama drama's screamin on and
too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot, another jam or not
has gotten me to the point, i'm like a snail
i've got to formulate a plot fore i end up in jail or shot
success is my only mothaf***in option, failure's not
mom, i love you, but this trail has got to go
i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go is my shot.
feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that i got
and i'm grindin' til i'm tired
they say ""you ain't grindin' til you die

but i'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
like what the hell am i doing right?
i keep having this dream, i'm pushin' hailie on the swing
she keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""you're making mommy cry, why? why is mommy crying?""
baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""daddy you're
lying
""you always say that, you always say this is the last time
""but you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine""
she's piling boxes in front of the door trying to
block it
""daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy   no stop
it!""
goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
it's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe daddy, take it withcha'""
i look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
these f***in' walls must be talking, cuz man i can
hear 'em
they're saying ""you've got one more chance to do
right""   and it's tonight
now go out there and show that you love 'em before
it's too late
and just as i go to walk out of my bedroom door
it's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this
spotlight is on
and i'm singing...
... it's my life."

skinny tires on a salad diet
chopper leave you with a half a body
no hesitation, no stall like the bathroom crowded
chopper so big, so tall, it could wrap around me
triple a, astronomic and atomic
tunechi, and it's that sorry 4 the wait
and i'm so sorry for the wait"
"young money yeah... uh
throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
but it's ""f*** the world"", get a child out her
yeah, my life a b****, but you know nothing 'bout her
been to hell and back, i can show you vouchers
i'm rolling sweets, i'm smoking sour
married to the game but she broke her vows
that's why my bars are full of broken bottles
and my night stands are full of open bibles
i think about more than i forget
but i don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
and these niqqas know i lay them down, make your bed
b****es try to kick me while i'm down, i'll break your leg
money outweighing problems on the triple beam
i'm sticking to the script, you niqqas skipping scenes
be good or be good at it
f***ing right i've got my gun, semi cartermatic
yeah, put the d*** in they mouth, so i guess it's ""f*** what they say""
i'm high as a b****, up, up and away
man, i come down in a couple of days
ok, you want me up in the cage, then i'll come out in beast mode
i got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the g code
it's weezy motherf***er, blood gang and i'm in bleed mode
all about my dough, but i don't even check the peephole
so you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
no love lost, no love found
it's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say just b**** you get you show me nothing but hate
you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around
and you don't you b**** you get b**** you get and i don't need you get em
i'm alive again
more alive than i have been in my whole entire life
i can see these people's ears perk up as i begin
to spaz with the pen, i'm a little bit sicker than most
shit's finna get thick again
they say the competition is stiff
but i get a hard d*** from this shit, now stick it in
i ain't never giving in again
caution to the wind, complete freedom
look at these rappers, how i treat 'em
so why the f*** would i join 'em when i beat 'em
they call me a freak cause
i like to spit on these pussies fore i eat 'em
man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
where the f*** is kanye when you need him?
snatch the mic from him, b**** imma let you finish in a minute
yeah the rap is tight
but i'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
and start over from scratch and write new ones
but i'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
when i rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
it's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
in the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
you can see the sparks from hot metal
cold hearted from the day i bogarted the game
i so started to rock fellow
when i'm not even in my harshest
you can still get roasted because marsh is not mellow
'til i'm toppling from the top i'm not going to stop
i'm standing on my monopoly board
that means i'm on top of my game and it don't stop
'til my hip don't hop anymore
when you so good that you can't say it
because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
people just get sick cause you spit
these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
and you can never break my stride
you never slow the momentum at any moment i'm about to blow
you'll never take my pride
killing the flow, slow venom any opponent
is getting no mercy, mark my words
ain't letting up, relentless
i smell blood, i don't give a f***, keep giving 'em hell
where was you when i fell and needed help up?
you get no love
it's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say, just b**** you get you show me nothing but hate
you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around
and you don't you b**** you get b**** you get and i don't need you b**** you get no "

sometimes a n**** feel like shit
talkin' 'bout some real life shit
goodbye letter, dear life shit
so if a n**** kill me, hope he mean it
i just hope i die for a reason
they probably won't miss me 'til they need me
have problems with admitting that they need me
have problems with they man then they need me, lord
i'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
goodbye letter, dear life shit
way too concerned to be conceited
i live and i learn, then die tryna teach 'em, lord
die tryna reach 'em
they care more about how much
i leave 'em when i leave it
i hope i leave more of an impression
on my kids to be destined
to have blessings to believe in, lord
just got off the phone with my son
told him, ""you a son of a gun""
just got off the phone with my daughter
told her, ""i won't hesitate to f*** a young n**** up""
lord, a few b****es left me
and only got a new b**** elected
my old b**** was too disrespectful
and only give my new b**** respect
that's power, yes
so now we're next
can't lie though, i tried though
i'l die tryin', that's a common death
we was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
then it stopped, now i'm outta breath
now they try to tell me i need rest
and i'l find love again, i ain't find it yet
oh, but i guess it is what it is
as it appears, oh shit
the object in the mirror is more near
than it appears, oh shit
and sometimes i fear who in the mirror
that n**** weird
he done died so many times but still here
why am i here? here
life
what is my meaning? my reason?
naked b****es really love ones
sometimes our loved ones don't love us
i'm f***in' more than i'm makin' love
sometimes i make my rubber wear a rubber
i just tell my lady, ""nothing's easy""
even though i make it look easy
but understand looks are deceiving
lookin' like i'm lookin' for some grievance
'cause i been through way too much
don't wanna think about it
crank about it, gotta drink about it
gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
i'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
can't deny it, you can't take my lion
i'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
i can't describe it
feel like a anchor tied to my finger
got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
i know a lotta n****s think i got a lotta n****s
there's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
i talked to god the other day, he said he got a n****
so, i look death up in her eye and then i wink
it's way too real
the shit i'm talkin' way way too real
i hope it gave you chills
the dirt under your feet could be the grave, you feel
you don't know how dead you feel until you're dead for real
gettin' high after i paid the bill
lower than a navy seal
show up with them navy guns
i hope somebody prayin' for 'em
price tag, no mistake, somebody payin' for 'em
ice baths, now my face numb, no expression
what's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
mama told me, ""f*** the world and be so aggressive""
be so fluorescent
watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
i don't get too high to look over blessings
never come in second, make the most of your seconds
they so precious
'cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
if you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
i keep it real, n****s better keep it copacetic
lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
i was too busy to talk, i wrote an open letter
dear life
was is my meaning? my reason?
that's the question
i ask the reader
god bless the reader
dear life
what is my meaning? my reason?
that's the question
you know, when he told me toya was havin' a baby
i say, ""y'all young. you know y'all young. ""
but i said, ""be the best father you can be, ""
you know. and truly, he is that"

before i sleep i pray to the lord
a soul to keep
and if i should die
before i wake
i pray to the lord
my soul to take
for goodness sake
yeah i wrote my will just the other week
and whats funny, it was only one sheet
and i know theres only one me
but i hope i am everything my son be
im trying to live right, stay on that drum beat
but im in the fast lane, in the front seat
i wonder will i loose control of the mazarati and hit some tree just being young me
is there a heaven for g's and soldiers? i cant go to hell, cause i'd take over
i feel it approaching, but i aint scared
i made that bed, and i should rest in peace
before i sleep i pray to the lord
a soul to keep
and if i should die
before i wake
i pray to the lord
my soul to take
for goodness sake
yeah and everytime i see the sunshine
i drop down and give thanks at least one time
feelin like im living on the front line
im feelin like every second is crunch time
i've had breakfast, will i make it to lunchtime?
and i ain't joking, so dont be looking for punchlines
will i be the next victim of a gun crime
i dont know the answer, thats why i brung mine
riding by myself late at night
pistol on my lap at every single red light
yeah i made my bed right, so when i do i should sleep tight
in peace i rest
before i sleep i pray to the lord
a soul to keep
and if i should die
before i wake
i pray to the lord
my soul to take
for goodness sake
bury me a gangster cause that's what i live
don't cry for me i gave the best i could give
i can only do me, so that's what i did
and i cherish every breath of my kid
and i don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool
but in this game of life i don't make the rules
shit, so that's why i get twisted
so i can't feel it when it hits me
and my moms don't need that on her
but i see death around the corner
and if he, so happens to make his way around the block
you gotta answer the door when he knock
believe that
before i sleep i pray to the lord
a soul to keep
and if i should die
before i wake
i pray to the lord
my soul to take
for goodness sake"

aint got shit to do with this, but i just thought that i should mention,
you looking for devine and the little intervention,
and them birds don't fly, without my permission,
i'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes,
or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons,
see my world is different,
like dwayne wayne,
and if you want trouble, b****, i want the same thang,
and you know that imma ride with my motherf**kin n****s,

and if you're talking to them n****s, don't talk for free,
and i hate when a n**** say talk is cheap,
cuz im the type to let money talk for me,
my flow is art, unique,
my flow can part a sea,
the only thing on a mind of a shark, is eat,
by any means, and you're just sardines,
i got the 40 cal. tuck in my p.r.ps.,
what do you expect, im from new orleans,
and majority of my city is riders,
they tried to make a brand new map without us,
but the tourists come down and spend too many dollars,
and no matter how you change it, it will still be ours,
and imma ride with my motherf**kin n****s,
most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
don't worry bout mine, imma grind till i get it
and tell all of my n****s that the sky is the limit,
the sky is the limit,
the sky is the limit,
and imma tell all of my n****s that the sky is the limit,
because the sky is the limit,
yeah, the sky is the limit,
and if you look up high, you'll see that i'm goin be in it,
cuz the sky is the limit,
and you don't wanna f**k with a soldier,

run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the livingroom sofa, 
and you don't wanna f**k with a soldier,

"i've been lonely
i've been waiting for you
i'm pretending
and thats all i can do
the love i'm sending ain't making it through to your heart
since i've lost you, i'm lost too
n**** feelin' like he at the bottom like a horseshoe
sorry for the trouble that i put you and your heart through
god knows that i'd do anything for a part 2,
or to
be prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me
give me another chance, i'm needin' it like a kidney
i don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
give me back her touch, i don't ask for much
but i f**ked up, i know i f**ked up, i admit i f**ked up
but everybody f**k up, now this other n**** luck up
tell him me and my clique don't give a f**k
cuz uh we from new orleans, she was from georgia
she was my down chick, i was her soldier
i was her gangster, she was my shoulder
you were the pistol to my holster.. bang
you've been hiding, never letting it show
always trying, to keep it under control
you got it down, and your well on your way to the top
but there is something you forgot
you forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
i remember everything, i just wanna hear you sing
i remember the love, right after the fights
you can't tell me you don't remember those nites
and if i would cry, you would cry twice
to me you are the brightest star under the sunlight
see take away my title, take away my stripes
you give me back my girl and you give me back my life
give me back my girl and you give me back my life
see this is just a nightmare, so i blink twice
open up my eyes hopin' she be in my sight
i remember the time, i wish i could bring it back
what she mean to me, is what i mean to rap
you've been hiding, never letting it show
always trying
to keep it under control
you got it down
and your well on your way to the top
but i hope you haven't forgot me up in the livin' room watchin' sportscenter
you were cookin' dinner, i was such a sinner, but the lord is a forgiver
you know they say if you pray, then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
and your boyfriend is not like me
ma' you even went and got a teardrop like me
i remember we would sit at home all day
you called me butter, i called you bay
my momma asked about you, my partners did too
i know your daughter will be so amazing like you
and i know you probably wish you never met me, and i just wish you never forget me
and let me say, please don't worry about the women i have been with
no engagement can amount to your friendship
and i hope that n**** know he got a queen, and all i can do is dream... damn
i've been lonely
i've been waiting for you
i'm pretending, and thats all i can do
the love i'm sending ain't making it through to your heart"

"people around you should really have nothing to say
me, i’m just proud of the fact that you’ve done it your way
and the weekends here, started it right
even if you only get part of it right
live for today, plan for tomorrow
party tonight, party tonight
dying to meet your girlfriends
that you said you might bring
if they’re the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ohhh
houston girls, love the way it goes down
atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
vegas girls, love the way it goes down
but i gotta say, oh babe, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
just may already feel like i know the real her
you must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
we must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
you got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
you must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
they keep telling me don’t save you
if i ignore all that advice
then something isn’t right
then who will i complain to?
but the weekends here, started it right
even if i only get part of it right
live for today, plan for tomorrow
party tonight, party tonight
you got your guards up, i do too
there’s things we might discover
cause you got a path and i do too
we’re perfect for each other, ohhh
houston girls, love the way it goes down
atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
vegas girls, love the way it goes down
but i gotta say, oh babe, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
just may already feel like i know the real her
you must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
we must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
you got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
you must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
cause to her i’m just a rapper, and soon she’ll have met another
so if tonight’s an accident, tomorrow we’ll recover
and i know i’m not supposed to judge a book by its cover
i don’t wanna be in the blind, but sometimes i stevie wonder
about her, and she with it if i’m with it, and i’m with it
i know what makes her smile, but i want to know what makes her different
or should i just be realistic? lipstick on the glass
see i know this ain’t your first, but it’s better than your last
tunechi
you must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
we must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
you got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
you must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
shower her with dolla tips, shawty went and bought a whip
guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that hoe a scholarship
all of them ain’t all equipped, and this saddens me, i see the peckin’ order
quote unquote bad b****es work the whole flo’, those that can laugh that sit off in a corner
like a lab rat, nobody want her, n****s that are married don’t wanna go home but
we look up to them, they wish they were us, they want some new trim, we lust for some trust
now that both of us are colorblind, cause the other side looks greener
which leaves your turf in a boise state, can’t see a play or the team
cause everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
and those who says they don’t, souls will later on say to them: “that ain’t true”
all of them will have an opinion, but y’all know what y’all can do with them
but if you’re unsure, i’ll take you on tour to a place you can stick that in
well, sittin’ here sad as hell listenin’ to adele, i feel ya baby
“someone like you”, more like someone unlike you, or somethin’ that’s familiar, maybe
and i can tell that she wants a baby, and i can yell: “girl, that you’re crazy”
aw, what the hell, nope, can’t be lazy, please be careful, b****es got the rabies"
"uh, umm, weezy ya'll,
young money, cash money,
this is,
ladies and gentlemen, you all know me,
you know i ride for my motherfunkin' n****s,
most likely i'm gonna die with my finger on the trigger,
they tell me don't get high, and not to try to make a living,
i tell them i'm a hustler and i'd rather make a killing
my eyes is so wide as he watching the skillet,
i let my b**** bag it, if she steal it, i'm gonna kill her,
i bulletproof the ride, now i feel like armadillas,
and f*** you, hospital, young money, we're the illest,
and i ain't gotta lie when i tell you i'm the illest,
my flow is nasty, like c y phyllis,
self made g, and them b****es know the business.
relying on rap, but in the kitchen i'm a chemist,
and when i was 5, my favorite movie was ""the gremlins""
ain't got shit to do with this, but i just thought that i should mention,
you looking for devine and the little intervention,
and them birds don't fly, without my permission,
i'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes,
or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons,
see my world is different,
like dwyane wade
and if you want trouble, b****, i want the same thing,
and you know that i'm gonna ride with my motherf***ing n****s,
most likely i'mma die with my finger on the trigger,
don't worry bout mine, i'mma grind till i get it
and tell all of my n****s that the sky is the limit,
the sky is the limit,
the sky is the limit,
and tell all of my n****s that the sky is the limit
'cause the sky is the limit,
the sky is the limit,
and if you look high, you see that i'm gonna be in it
the sky is the limit,
buck ten in the coupe, and your b**** love it,
switching lane faster than she switch subject,
tell a b**** don't talk to me,
and if you're talking to them n****s, don't talk for free,
and i hate when a n**** say talk is cheap,
'cause i'm the type to let money talk for me,
my flow is art, unique,
my flow can part a seat,
the only thing on a mind of a shark, is eat,
by any means, and you're just sardine,
i got the 40 cal. tuck in my p.r.ps.,
what do you expect, i'm from new orleans,
and majority of my city is rowders,
they tried to make a brand new map without us,
but the tourists come down and spend too many dollars,
and no matter how you change it, it will still be ours,
and i'm gonna ride with my motherf***ing n****s,
most likely i'mma die with my finger on the trigger,
don't worry bout mine, i'mma grind till i get it
and tell all of my n****s that the sky is the limit,
the sky is the limit,
the sky is the limit,
and i'mma tell all of my n****s that the sky is the limit,
because the sky is the limit,
yeah, the sky is the limit,
and if you look up high, you'll see that i'm gonna be in it,
cause the sky is the limit,
and you don't wanna f*** with a soldier,
use your head, or i'll take it off ya shoulder,
run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the living room sofa,
and you don't wanna f*** with a soldier,
use your head, or ill take it off ya shoulder,
mail it to your mom, put a dozen of roses, and i'm a g,
and you ain't gotta know that f. for best to see,
i know that my whole city is depending on me,
and i forget a lot of shit, but i could never forget the streets,
so you know that i'm gonna ride with my motherf***ing n****s,
most likely i'm a die with my finger on the trigger,
don't worry bout mine, i'mma grind till i get it
and tell all of my n****s that the sky is the limit,
the sky is the limit,
don't worry bout mine, i'mma grind till i get it
and tell all of my n****s that the sky is the limit,
because the sky is the limit,
yeah, the sky is the limit,
and if you look high, you'll see that i'm gonna be in it,
'cause the sky is the limit,
they tell me don't get high, and not to try to make a living,
i tell them i'm a hustler and i'd rather make a killing
'cause the sky is the limit,
hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit,
can you see me up there? the sky is the limit,
the sky is the limit,
if you don't know nothing about it, the sky is the limit."

"we are at war
with the universe
the sky is falling
and the only thing that can save us now
is sensitivity and compassion
but i know one thing's for sure
i'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down
lil wayne parts:
some say tragedy is hard to get over
but some time that tragedy means its over, soulja
from the academy, league of rollers
i deny being down though they seem to hold us
my shoulders are strong, i prove them wrong
i ain't doing nothin but movin on, let the truth be known
but they talk that freedom matters, and didn't even leave a ladder, damn
i work at the corner store
we all got problems problems
no one' gon fly alone
no one's gon save us now
how you feel, you're not alone
we're all just jealous jealous
we don't reach the sky no more
we just can't overcome no
chorus
tie my hands
what am i gonna be
what have i done so bad
what is my destiny
tie my hands
what am i supposed to see
what have i done so bad
what am i gonna be
i, knock on the door, hope isn't home,
fates not around, the lucks all gone
don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right
and ima tell you whats life
and did you know?
i lost everything, but i ain't the only one
first came the hurricane, then the morning sun
excuse me if i'm on one, and don't trip if i light one, i walk a tight one
they try to tell me keep my eyes open
my whole city under water, some people still floatin
then they wonder why black people still voting, cause your presidents still chokin
take away the football team, the basketball team
now all we got is me to represent new orleans
no governor, no help from the mayor
just a steady beatin heart, and a wish and a prayer
these friends they come and go
but i got family family
these kids so fast they grow
they learn so quickly now
but there's no way to go,
but there's future future
don't make this seem so low
that we can't overcome
chorus
and if you come from under the water then theres fresh air
just breathe baby, gods got a blessing to spare
yes, i know the process has so much stress
but its the progress that fills the best
cause i came from the projects straight to success
and your next, so try they cant steal your pride its inside
then find it and keep on grinding
cause in every dark cloud theres a silver lining
i know...
right now we just riding on love
and shining dark, we aint tryna do nothing be at the heart
we need love, that's all now
chorus:
you tie my hands, what am i gonna be
what have i done so bad, what is my destiny
you tie my hands, what am i going to see
what have i done so bad, what am i gonna be
born right here in the usa
but due to tragedy, looked on by the whole world as a refugee
so, accept my emotion, do not take it as an offensive gesture
it's just the epitome of my soul
and i must be me
we got spirit y'all
we go spirit
we got soul y'all
we got soul
they don't want us to see, but we already know"

i feel the pressure from my lil peers

big fish swimming in the deep end

i’m booking on your suckers like im just leaving college
but smart, very smart, too smart for ya knowledge
too smart once more, wayne called me a genius
it’s yme nothing gets inbetween us
tell wayne i’m going in like somebody bout to bury me
in this rap game nobody could ever bury me
thats why you see me on stage rocking with young money
i told my team i got us man it’s all on me
like volume 2 bg i got my crew with me
twist, mack, millz, gudda and my baby nicki
everytime i’m on the track it’s ransom
can’t find us anymore it’s random
when young money come through you better salute us
hey i solomly swear if it ever go down
you aint never gotta call me cause i’mma be there
lets get to the point like elbows, my crew harder than shelltoes
strapped like velcrow and this we running hell no
and truthfully, aiming for number one oh do we
you ask why i reply cause nobody remember 2 or 3
cross ym and the hem will make a movie
we all we can be, respect the army and salute we
yeah, young money army we marching
we coming forward no warning
we got these boys running like forest
so salute me like a general
first place never last
always on top and i’m a cheif like a seminol
got the game in strangle hold no letting up
you can get the top, ya can pop like 7 up
knock knock let us up, young money applaud me
and we’ll take the game out your hands like a joy stick
i’mma need my badges and my ribbons
maybe it will make up for everything that i wasn’t given
everything that i’ve given, i swear i’ll never give in

just look at what i’ve been in and this is just the beginning
i d d d d do it cause i did it for my ballerina girls
blowing kisses to the soldiers i am marilyn monroe
but we shoot shoot shoot em up, camoflauge me,
cuz young money is the navy better yet the army
commander in chief
one hand on the world, one hand on the brief
i stand on the world, b tch i stand on the peak
of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now thats g
don’t ask me about sh t but money
f ckin’ right my money long i got that 10ft money
i get it fast when i get to the money
when i walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
i meant feet, i’m in deep like wet p ssy
i’m a purple heart proven war vet rookie
you can’t even sit next to me
now bring money or death to me.. or don’t step to me
now don’t step n gga, march with me
to the steps of the court building
like ain’t we god’s children
i know at all times god’s feel me
so i play my part until the war kill me
salute.. or.. shoot!

"no ceilings

president got 'em in the white house naked
looked at the clock and it say 'right now'
get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
panatela dutchie, wine in my tall glass
young money, baby, big shit, like a horse ass
stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
bugatti matte black, ""where they do that at? ""
south beach miami, ho
i'm probably with tammy to'
my life is a video
and the women want they cameo
i just want them pantyhose
and i'm higher than geronimo
and i got them tools

now pop that p**** like a. 44
i turn you 'round
and bend you over like a low blow

we done put them other n****s on a hiatus
beat your b**** with the pump if she deny data
'cause i'll serve anyone like a blind waiter
i make my girl cum first then i arrive later
i shake you pussies up, i'm a vibrator
getting money like hell yeah
this shit's so good it don't even smell bad
and you can tell dad that i'm a motherf***er

i tried to pay attention, but y'all mad boring
and i got so much swag i need an ad for it
and i don't like to brag so my b****es brag for me
oh, she a good girl? i got her transforming
she give me hot head, i call it global warming

i am more animal than the zoo allow
put me in the wild, i'll be there for a while
you n****s little league, call 'em curaçao
energizer money, it keep going
i'm laid up, i'm free throwing
who rebounding? who gives a shit?
f*** that, i got 27 years of this
hit or miss, i hit your missus
you are local news, i'm 60 minutes
i hit the target, i hit the witness
i work out in my office, guess i'm fit for business
too many visions, completed missions
still icing out crosses, keep it christian
we consistent, the streets commend it
weezy f. baby, the 'f' is for 'forensics'
from start to finish, usain wayne
ok, you're doing your thang, well things change
you plain jane, i'm diverse
i save the world second, and i get high first
i'm a mind freak, check my time sheet
b****, i bring the noise, where the lions sleep
your flow never wet, like grandma p****
i'm always good, like grandma cookies
yeah, call me the spleen or the spine fixer
it's going down like the catalina wine mixer
she going down like the hands on my time ticker
i'm always strapped; vietnam, n****
we are fine, n****, like amber rose
we ball, n****, like jalen rose
better tell them hoes, i got a million flows
label me the hardest n**** in civilian clothes
it's young money, baby, and the building grows

with a body like woman so her age meant nothing
i had to get her number
after how she made them daisy doots fit her all summer
i'm wishing i could hit her all summer
and all she ever wanted
was for young weezy to love her
but all i ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
but that didnt come easy
'cuz she ended up being my baby's mother
and then i felt smothered but little did i know
i'd never find the same girl inside another
but i never thought that i'd be looking for her
and i never thought that late at night
when i'm in the mix...laying down with some chick
that suddenly it'll click
how this broad in my drawers dont know shit

when's there's a woman with my kid where i should be
she screamed to me my love, my patience, my pain n**** please

i met her after the fame

mami was a nice piece, young cali sweet thang
made her into wifey and then reality changed
it was going good...i was happy again
but then things got rapidly strange
and it had to be wayne
she was still a virgin
what more could i ask from a dame
but i was a bastard...i asked for the pain
now my ass in the rain
and she got a new life...the picture flipped
and none of it includes weez and all his bullshit and i remember the bahamas for the weekend
we was freaking in the suite
and she looked sweet enough to beat it up
till we began to sleep and i
i'm dreaming 'bout the victoria secret lingerie
told me keep it..she aint want moms to see it
and just think i once saw it on the girl's body
now all i'm seeing is nobody
