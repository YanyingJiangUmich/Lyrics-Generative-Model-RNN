"the sound that you're listening to is from my guitar that's named lucille. i'm very crazy about lucille. lucille took me from the plantation. oh you might say, brought me fame.
i don't think i could just talk enough about lucille. sometime when i'm blue seem like lucille try to help me call my name.
i used to sing spirituals and i thought that this was the thing that i wanted to do. but somehow or other when i went in the army i picked up on lucille, and started singing blues.
well, now when i'm paying my dues, maybe you don't know what i mean when i say paying dues, i mean when things are bad with me. i can always, i can always, you know like, depend on lucille.
sort of hard to talk to you myself. i guess i'll let lucille say a few words and then.
you know, i doubt if you can feel it like i do. but when i think about the things that i've gone through, like, well for instance, if i have a girlfriend and she misuses me, and i go home at night, maybe i'm lonely, well not maybe, i am lonely, i pick up lucille and it bring out those funny sounds that sound good to me, you know. sometime i get to the place where i can't even say nothing.
look out.
sometime i think it's crying.
you know, if i could sing pop tunes like frank sinatra or sammy davis junior, i don't think i still could do it, 'cause lucille don't wanna play nothing but the blues. i think i'm, i think i'm pretty glad about that. cause don't nobody sing to me like lucille. sing, lucille.
well, i'll put it like this. take it easy, lucille. i like the way sammy sings and i like the way frank sings, but i can get a little frank, sammy, a little ray charles, in fact all the people with soul in this.
a little mahalia jackson in there.
one more, lucille!
take it easy now.
you know, i imagine a lot of you wanna know, a lot of you wanna know why i call the guitar lucille. lucille has practically saved my life two or three times. no kidding, it really has.
i remember once i was in an automobile accident, and when the car stopped turning over, it fell over on lucille, and it held it up off me, really, it held it up off me. so that's one time it saved my life.
the way, the way i came by the name of lucille, i was over in twist, arkansas, i know you've never heard of that one, have you? and one night the guys started a ball over there, you know, they started brawling, you know what i mean. and the guy that was mad with his old lady, when she fell over on this gas tank that was burning for heat, the gas ran all over the floor.
and when the gas ran all over the floor, the building caught on fire, and almost burned me up trying to save lucille. oh i, i imagine you're still wondering why i call it lucille, the lady that started that brawl that night was named lucille.
and that's been lucille ever since to me. one more now, lucille.
sounds pretty good to me. can i do one more?
look out, lucille.
sounds pretty good. i think i'll try one more. all right."

"i was born and raised down in alabama on a farm way back up in the woods. oh
i was so ragged folks used to call me ""patches"". papa used to tease me about
it, but deep down inside dad was hurtin' 'cause he'd done the best he could.
my papa was a great old man
i can see him with a shovel in his hand
education that he never had
but he did wonders when the times got bad
the little money from the crops we raised
barely paid the bills we made
oh life whipped him
down to the ground
when he tried to get up
life would kick him back down
on the day papa called me
to his dyin' bed
placed his hand on my shoulders
and in tears he said
patches
i'm depending on you, son
to pull the family through
my son, it's all left up to you
two days later papa passed away
and i became a man that day
everyday i had to work the fields
'cause that's the only way
we got our meals
see, i was the oldest of the family
and everybody was depending on me
now the years have passed
and everybody's grown
mama's been livin'
in a brand new home
lord knows it took
a lot of sweat and tears
and my daddy's voice
to help us through the years
he said  
patches
i'm depending on you, son
to pull the family through
my son, it's all left up to you
daddy had been sick for a long time, flat on his back. every evenin' after
we'd finish our chores and eat our dinner, we'd all go into papa's room to
cheer him up a little. and this particular day dad was in good spirits,
sittin' on the side of the bed, tellin' mama how good she looked. when all
of a sudden, papa had a pain in his chest. i was too young to understand,
talkin' about a heart attack here. mama rushed us all out of the room into
the hallway. about ten minutes later she came out with tears in her eyes.
she called out to me, ""patches, patches, get in here, boy. your daddy wanna
see you."" i went runnin' into papa's room, there papa lay. daddy had tears
in his eyes. i knew something was wrong, daddy was a poor man, but all of my
life he'd been a proud man. i knelt down on one knee beside the bed, papa
put his hand on my shoulder. he said, ""patches, patches, boy, the hammer of
life done beat your old papa down to the ground, and i ain't got nobody to
turn to to take care of mama and the younger. so what i want you to do is
promise me, son, is that you're gonna do your best to help your mama as much
as you can."" i said, ""papa, i'm gonna do my best."" but little did i know
then like i know now, that tryin' to climb life's mountains searchin' for a
top where there ain't no top, sometimes you find yourself frustrated, lazy.
but every time i feel like i can't live my life like i want to, my mind goes
back to that day when i see those tears in my daddy's eyes. but most of all
i remember his words, ""patches, i'm dependin' on you, boy."" every time i
feel like givin' up, i hear his voice. ""patches, patches, patches, patches  ""
i'm depending on you, son
i've tried to do my best
it's up to you to do the rest
patches
i'm depending on you, son
i've tried to do my best
it's up to you to do the rest
patches
i'm depending on you, son
to pull the family through
my son, it's all left up to you"

"went to a party
the new york style
i met a lady
make a sane man wild
she said the words only her lips could say
she made me want to throw my life away
but when i asked her
she said ""maybe tomorrow, b.b.""
and that's a story everybody knows
i took her flying
out across the sea
i thought i had her
i know that she had me
and when we landed
it was paris, france
seemed like a nice place
for some french romance
but when i touched her
she said ""maybe a little later, b.b.""
and that's the story everybody knows
we went to berlin
and to stockholm too
and on the moscow
then to the peking zoo
as far as travel, she couldn't get too much
somewhere in oakland
she let me have just a little touch
and then she said ""i'm late for beauty appointment,
i've got a headache, and i believe i'm coming down with the flu""
and that's the story everybody knows"
"you may be rich
you may be poor
you may be high
or you just may be low
but if you fall in love
oh, and you should lose
a woman don't care
she don't care who she gives the blues
wo, you may be young
you may be old
maybe you've heard
or maybe you've never been told
if you've got a good woman
oh, try not to misuse
oh, a woman don't care
she don't care who she gives the blues
she'll make you hot in the winter
make you cold in the summertime
she'll make you feel young in the spring
and in the fall drive you out of your mind
a woman don't you hear me callin' you?
yeah woman, you don't care
yeah, you don't care who you give the blues
oh, you may be up
you may be down
you may be short, tall, skinny
or you just might be round
oh, don't be too sure of your woman
thinkin' man, that you can't lose
oh, remember that a woman don't care
she don't care who she gives the blues"
"you and me don't see eye to eye
on every little thing
we've missed a lot of sunshine
and caught a lot of rain
if you want to leave i can't make you stay
but there is something i have to say
no matter how high you get
or how low you go
there's one thing darling
you ought to know
there's a world full of strangers out there
a world full of strangers
beware
there's a world full of strangers out there
and if it gets too strange
just come on home
restless hearts, looking for a love
are waiting in the street
they're all prepared to give you
the bitter with the sweet
if you wake someday and you reach for me
well you know, this is where i'll be
no matter how high you get
or how low you go
there's one thing darling
you ought to know
there's a world full of strangers out there
a world full of strangers
beware
there's a world full of strangers out there
and if it gets too strange
just come on home"
"the late show is over
and the city is fast asleep
and i'm lost in a world
that's just too cold and deep
i've turned so many ways
i'm spinning like a top
i wish that i could get off
or get this world to stop
i'm a stranger and afraid
i'm a stranger and afraid
i'm a stranger and afraid
in a world i never made
i'm always chasing dragons
with a sword that's made of tin
so i know in my soul
there's no way i can win
i tried, oh i tried
but there's no place, no place to go
there's no one here who knows me
and no one here i know
i'm a stranger and afraid
i'm a stranger and afraid
i'm a stranger and afraid
in a world i never made"
"you won't listen to nothing i tell you, baby
you keep on doing just as you please
hey, you won't do nothing i tell you, baby
keep on doing as you please
i've taken as long as i can, baby
when is this foolishness gonna cease
i've worried myself crazy, baby
cried both night and day
i said i've worried myself crazy, baby
cried both night and day
you don't believe me, baby
but i'm gonna leave one of these days
well, you told me that you love me
but actions speak louder than words
oh, you said you love me, baby
but action speaks louder than words
i won't be fooled no longer, baby
that line everybody's heard
well, if you're gonna change, baby
you better do it real soon
hey, if you're gonna change
for the better, baby
you better do it real soon
because you'll wake up one of these mornings
find yourself in a empty room"
"don't care when you go
how long you stay
good time treatments
bring you back someday
oh but someday, baby
i ain't gonna worry my life any more
ain't but one thing
give me the blues
when i've worn a hole
in my last pair of shoes
oh but someday, baby
i ain't gonna worry my life any more"
"once upon a time, a long long time ago
wherever you'd lead me, i would surely follow
girl, you put me through some pain and misery
and now you are standing on my doorstep
telling me how much you need me
baby, ain't nobody home
ain't nobody home
how many times i begged for you to come home
but you laughed at me and said let me alone
through my falling tears i saw you walk away
and now you're beggin' me to forgive you
but this time, baby, it's your turn to beg
baby, ain't nobody home
ain't nobody home
girl, i used to love you, placed no one else above you
gave you everything that i own
girl, you can't come back here
ain't nobody home
once upon a time, when you went on your way
but, girl, i hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day
but time has made some changes, turned me upside down
so, you can beg me to forgive you
but this time, baby, you can turn right around
ain't nobody home
ain't nobody home
girl, you hurt me once
i hear you knockin'"
"i'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me everything
i said i'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me everything
and it makes me feel so good, just to hear my baby call my name
my baby's sly way of loving, makes me feel so good i could sing
hey my baby's sly way of loving, makes me feel so good i could sing
i feel just like i'm a millionaire, when i hear my baby call my name
oh, there ain't nobody like my baby, that's the reason i love her so
oh, ain't nobody, nobody like my baby, that's the reason i love her so
people, i would even die for her, i want the whole round world to know
when i'm down she'll picks me up, she says, ""daddy, you can't lose""
oh, when i'm down, when i'm down, she picks me up, tells me, ""baby, you can't lose""
when all of my friends forget about me, my baby keeps away all these blues"
"oh, i'm three, three times seven
oh, that makes twenty one
ah, that ain't nobody's bizness what i do
oh, if i attend church all day sunday
and cabaret all day monday
it ain't nobody's bizness what i do
if i stay out all night
spending my money i tell you that's all right
because it ain't nobody's bizness what i do
it ain't nobody's bizness what i do

i say, i've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead
to pick up me a tombstone, and be pronounced dead
when i read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed
i read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed
and that's when i decided, that i would be better off dead
it read, there is no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me back

you won't wear
it's a nine thousand dollar thing
you don't care
i set up a wedding date
you couldn't make it
you said all the love we made
you were just faking
but girl, you know
what hurts me the most
is i gave all my love to you
all you ever give me
all you ever give me
all you ever give me is the blues
is the blues
i gave you my cadillac keys
you don't drive
i hired you a limousine
you won't ride
bought you the house on the hill
you hate the view
even wrote you into my will
gave you something to look forward to
but girl, you know
what hurts me the most
is i gave all my love to you
all you ever give me
all you ever give me
all you ever give me is the blues
nothing but the blues
i've tried and tried
but i'm mystified
i've done all that i can do
i've given you my best
you put me to the test
all you ever give me
all you ever give me
all you ever give me is the blues

maybe i didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
and i guess i never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine
if i made you feel second best
girl, i'm so sorry i was blind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died

have never ever known

faster than the speeding bullet

she said: arenç£˜ you b.b. king? she said:
oh b.b., sometimes itç£— so hard to pull things together

and i want you to listen to every word and govern yourselves accordingly
now, you see these girls with these fine diamonds, fine furs and fine clothes
well, they're looking for a husband and you're listening to a man who knows
they ain't foolin', and if you fool around with them
you're gonna get yourself in a schoolin'
listen, if she saves you dough, and won't go to the show
beware
if she's easy to kiss and won't resist
beware
and if you go for a walk, and she listens while you talk
she's tryin' to hook you
and nobody's lookin' and she asks you to taste her cookin'
don't do it, don't do it
and if you go to a show and she wants to sit in the back row
bring her down front, bring her right down front
if you wanna go for a snack, and she wants to sit in the booth in the back
beware
and listen, if she's used to caviar and fine silk
when you go out with her she wanna a hot dog and a malted milk
she's trying to get you
if you're used to goin' to carnegie hall, but when you take her out night clubing
all she wants is one meatball
you better take it easy
if she grabs your hand and says, ""darling, you're such a nice man""
beware, i'm telling you
you better listen to me 'cause i'm telling you what's being put down
you better pick up on it
if her sister calls your brother, you better get further
i'm telling you, you better watch it
and if she's acting kind of wild, and she says, ""darling, give me a trial""
don't you do it, don't be weak, don't give it to her
and if she smiles in your face and just melts into place
let her melt, forget it, let her melt
now listen, if she calls you up on the phone, and says,
""darling, are you all alone?""
tell her, ""no, no, i've got two, three women with me""
don't pay no attention to women
stand up for your right, be a man, be a man
if you turn out the lights and she don't fight
that's the end, it's too late
she's got you hooked, you might as well stick with her
if you get home about two and don't know what to do
you pull back the curtains, and the whole family's looking at you
get your business straight
set the date, don't be late
brother, beware, beware, beware
brother, you better beware"

and you loved her with all your might
did you ever love a woman
and you loved her with all your might
well, and you knew all the time
that the woman wasn't treating you right
you fix her breakfast in the morning
stay at home everyday
even wash the dishes
if she has to go away
you send the children to school
even mend their hose
stay up all nights with the babies
even wash their dirty clothes
did you ever love a woman
and you loved her with all your might
yes, and you knew all the time
that the woman wasn't treating you right
but when it's time to go to bed
the woman grabs you in her arms
she holds you real tight
she hugs you with all her charms
she calls you a lot of sweet names
then she turns out the light
she sets your soul on fire
and you say, ""baby, everything is all right""
did you ever love a woman
and you loved her with all your might
yes, and you knew all the time
that the woman wasn't treating you right"

sea of love
baby, i depended on you
for the love navigation
but now you've gone and deserted me
can't you see that i'm in desperation
i'm in the middle of a bad love storm
and it's bad as it can be
i look around, all i can see
is water coming down over me
i've been down one time
and i've been down two times
but right now i'm drowning
drowning in the sea of love
sea of love, sea of love
i've been down one time
and i've been down two times
but right now i'm drowning
drowning in the sea of love
sea of love
but right now i'm just drowning
drowning in the sea of love
a sea of love, sea of love

a long way from home

on her soft brown hair

all your congressmen, too
you got me frustrated
and i don't know what to do
i'm trying to make a living

i came up eating cornbread
candied yams and chicken stew

maybe baby's found somebody new
or is my baby still my baby true"

how to face another day

how it feels to walk alone
listening for those footsteps
through the echo of your own
suddenly it hits you
all those dreams weren't worth a dime
'cause no one ever tells you in time
long before
the icy winds of winter
autumn tells the swallows
time to fly
so why do we pretend
till the bitter end
till it breaks our hearts
to say good bye
well  
no one ever tells you
that it's just another fling
no one ever warns you
when your heart begins to sing
someone tells you later
all is fair in love and war
but no one ever tells you before
long before
our love boat's torn asunder
we can hear the thunder
of the falls
so why do we go on
sailing madly on
till all we had is gone
beyond recall
beyond recall
no one ever tells you
that it's just another fling

buying champagne, gin and wine

i couldn't find a friend, no place i go
if i ever get my hands on a dollar again
i'm gonna squeeze it, and squeeze it
till the eagle grins
nobody knows you when you're down and out
in your pocket, not one penny
and your friends, you haven't any
and as soon as you get on your feet again
everybody is your long lost friend
it's mighty strange, without a doubt, but
nobody wants you when you're down and out
you know folks, i once had a mansion
way up on the side of a hill
i'd give champagne and caviar parties
just for fun and get a thrill
but you know things they just can't stay like that forever
and now i can't muscle up enough money
to buy a shot of gin
but you know, if i ever get my hands on a dollar again
i'm gonna squeeze it, and squeeze it till the eagle grins
it's mighty strange, without a doubt
nobody wants you
nobody needs you
nobody wants you when you're down and out"

"now if you've ever been down to new orleans
then you can understand just what i mean
all thru the week it's quiet as a mouse
but on saturday night they go from house to house
you don't have to pay the usual admission
if you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician
so if you happen to be just passin' by
stop in at the saturday night fish fry
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
now my buddy and me was on the main stem
foolin' around just me and him
we decided we could use a little something to eat
so we went to a house on rampart street
we knocked on the door and it opened up with ease
and a lush little miss said, ""come in, please""
and before we could even bat an eye
we were right in the middle of a big fish fry
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
now the folks was havin' the time of their life
and sam was jivin' jimmie's wife
over in the corner was a beat up grand
being played by a big fat piano man
some of the chicks wore expensive frocks
some of them had on bobbie socks
but everybody was nice and high
at this particular saturday night fish fry
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'
the bottles was flyin', and the fish was smellin'
and way above all the noise we made
somebody hollered, ""you better get outta here, this is a raid!""
i didn't know we was breaking the law but
somebody reached over and hit me on the jaw
now they had us blocked off from front to back
and they was puttin' 'em in the wagon like potatoes in a sack
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
i knew i could get away if i had a chance
but i was shakin' like i had the st. vitus dance
so i tried to crawl in under a bath tab
when a policeman said, ""where are you goin' there, bub?""
now they got us out of there like a house on fire
and put us all in the black maria
now they might have missed a pitiful few
but they got both me and my buddy too
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
well we headed for jail in a dazed condition
they booked each one of us on suspicion
now my chick came down and paid my bail
and finally got me outta that rotten jail
now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye
just mention a saturday night fish fry
i don't care how many fish in the sea
but don't ever mention a fish to me
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
it was rockin', it was rockin'
you never seen such scufflin'
and shufflin' 'till the break of dawn"

"there's something on your mind
by the way you look at me
there's something on your mind, baby
by the way you look at me
and what you're thinking brings happiness
oh and it brings misery
please, please, don't try to tell me
i think, i, i understand
no, no, don't try to tell me, baby
'cause i think, i, i understand
you want me to try and forget you
well, i'll do
baby, i'll do the best i can
you know it hurts you when you're in love
with someone and you know that someone don't
love you. it carries a heavy burden on your
heart to know that the someone that you're in love with is
in love with your best friend. and i'll tell you, when someone
else is rocking you, rocking your cradle, you know, better
than you can rock your cradle yourself, then there's only
one thing for you to do. you just pack your clothes,
turn around, and slowly walk out of the door.
look over your left shoulder as you go out,
then you hang your head and you say:
oh please don't try to tell me
uh huh, i think, i understand
no, no, no, no
please don't try to tell me
because you think, you think i understand
oh you want me to try
to try to forget you, baby
and i'll tell you, i'll do the best i can
you know after you have done all you could do
and you can't take no more, then you go downtown,
you get your big baseball bat and you come back on
the scene where they both are still together,
and then you just go and kick down the door.
now as you kick down the door you just start
beating the hell of everybody that you can see,
everybody that comes through the door, and just
as you make up your mind that you're gonna try
to forgive her, then out comes another one of your
friends, and that really blows your mind. so you go and
think about, you say to yourself, baby, i realize i've done
wrong but please forgive me. and with a smirky smile
on her face then she look up at you and she say.
if you ever think about me
if you ever charge your mind
if you ever think about me
and if i ever cross your mind
well, you know, you know
you know i'm yours
and i know, i know you got to be mine
there's something on your mind, b.
i can tell by the way you look at me
there's something on your mind
by the way you look at me
and what you're thinking brings happiness
oh and it can bring misery"

love's out there somewhere but you know it won't come in
so let's remember baby how sweet all this has been
but when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
you know that's the beginning of the end
i make you sparkle like strawberry wine
and when i felt bad you make me feel fine
oh it's good when it's goin' and gone when it's gone
we both know enough to leave well enough alone
when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
baby can't you see that's the beginning of the end
the cool of the morning the heat of the night
the loving was good  it just wasn't right
someday when you wake up and call out my name
don't feel bad about it i'll probably do the same
but when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
baby don't ya know that's the beginning of the end"
"my baby gives me love
as good as love can be
i just leave her crying
when the blues come over me
up on a mountain
i'm drowning in the sea
all the clocks say midnight
when the blues come over me
the blues come over me
i pack it up and go
the blues come over me
i catch the wind and blow
and some will take the wine
and some will take the night
when everything's all wrong
then anything is all right
some put in a song
and some sing it for their dues
some go to sleep and wake up
tangled in the blues
the blues come over me
i pack it up and go
the blues come over me
i catch the wind and blow
the blues come in a whisper
and make you scream and shout
and you'll do most anything
just to let them out
i may think i'm happy
i may think i'm free
nothing don't mean nothing
when the blues come over me
the blues come up behind
the blues wait up ahead
the blues ask why you are born
if you just end up dead
the blues, talking about the blues
the blues, oh the blues, the blues
talking about the blues
when the blues come over me
talking about the blues
i have to go away
the blues, the blues
when the blues come over me
i have to pack it up and go"
"the blues has got me
and there is teardrops in my eyes
oh, the blues has got me
there is teardrops in my eyes
yes, dark is the night
since my baby said goodbye
oh, how i've suffered
since my baby wnet away
yes, how i've suffered
since my baby wnet away
yes, i've got that feeling
that my baby's gone to stay
take me back, darling

and you're the only one
talk to me baby

and i want my baby home
if your baby loves you

oh, if your baby loves you
keep her home and treat her nice
well, never mistreat a good woman
this is some doggone good advice"
"gone are the days i'm holding you tight
gone are the times i thrill with delight
oh how i've missed you and your tender kiss
i've been a fool too long
i took your love then broke your heart
can you forgive me, we'll make a new start
guess life ain't worth living if you are not giving
i've been a fool to long
i've played the field but could not conceal
the way i feel about you
everyone guessed i had no happiness
loving you the way i do
you carried my heart around in your hand
yes i still love you, please understand
life ain't worth living if you are not giving
i've been a fool to long"

your will to live
no matter what you've been through
long as there's breath in you
there is always one more time

every one that you've had
that don't mean that some dreams
can't come true
'cause it's funny about dreams
as strange as it seems
there is always one more time
oh turnin' corners
is only a state of mind
keeping your eyes closed
is worse than being blind
if there's a heart out there
looking for someone to share
i don't care if it's been
turned down time and time again
and if we meet one day
please don't walk away
'cause there is always one more time
there is always one more time"

you want me to try and forget you

that the someone that you're in love with
is in love with your best friend
and i'll tell you, when someone else is rocking you
rocking your cradle, you know
better than you can rock your cradle yourself
then there's only one thing for you to do
you just pack your clothes, turn around
and slowly walk out of the door
look over your left shoulder as you go out
then you hang your head and you say
oh please don't try to tell me
uh huh, i think, i understand
no, no, no, no
please don't try to tell me

oh you want me to try
to try to forget you, baby

you know after you have done all you could do
and you can't take no more
then you go downtown
you get your big baseball bat
and you come back on the scene
where they both are still together
and then you just go and kick down the door
now as you kick down the door
you just start beating the hell of everybody that you can see
everybody that comes through the door
and just as you make up your mind
that you're gonna try to forgive her
then out comes another one of your friends
and that really blows your mind
so you go and think about, you say to yourself, baby
i realize i've done wrong but please forgive me
and with a smirky smile on her face
then she look up at you and she say.
if you ever think about me
if you ever charge your mind
if you ever think about me
and if i ever cross your mind

you know i'm yours
and i know, i know you got to be mine

a guy feels lonely then, when you hear something like that
you can't do whatever you wanna do.
because your mind is on the person you know.
you figure something you've done
you don't know what it is because she won't tell you
but every time you look at her, she just starts to crying and won't say nothing.
then you say to yourself
it's my own fault, baby,
treat me the way you wanna do,
oh, yes, my own fault, baby,
treat me the way you wanna do.
because when you would love me, baby,
oh, a good time looked down,

but i've had my griefs
and my cares
and just a good word
soft and gentle
makes it, makes it
so much easier to bear
she might forget it
oh but don't let her forget it
love's got a whole
a whole happiness

try a little tenderness
oh it's so very easy

i was a sailor, i was lost in sea
i was under the waves, before love rescued me
i was a fighter i could turn on a threat
now i stand accused of the things i've said.
when love comes to town,
i'm gonna jump that train
when love comes to town,
i'm gonna catch that flame.
maybe i was wrong to ever let you down,
but i did what i did before love came to town.
used to make love under a red sunset,
i was making promises i was soon to forget.
she was pale as the lace of her wedding gown,
but i left her standing before love came to town.
ran into a juke joint when i heard a guitar scream,
the notes were turning blue when i fell into a dream
as the music played i saw my life turn around
that was the day before love came to town.
when love comes to town,
i'm gonna jump that train
when love comes to town,
i'm gonna catch that flame.
maybe i was wrong to ever let you down,
but i did what i did before love came to town.
i was there when they crucified my lord
i held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
i threw the dice when they pierced his side,
but i've seen love conquer the great divide.
when love comes to town,
i'm gonna jump that train
when love comes to town,
i'm gonna catch that flame.
maybe i was wrong to ever let you down,
but i did what i did before love came to town.
yeah, yeah, yeah..."

should...ladies you don't hurt 'im. i said don't you hurt him! man happens to be
god's gift to women! so ladies you must know that the man is already grown so you can't
raise him over again.
so the thing to do is throw your arms around him! hold him close to
you! look him straight in the eyes! and then you tell him... you tell him, you
say ""now baby you been messing up, but i know you gonna do me better."" and when he
look at you as if he wanna know when, then you tell him...""someday baby."" and if it seem
like he's hard of hearing or not paying you much attention or something do like you ladies
are known to do....put your hands on your hips and then you say it again...ow! he have to
be a mighty hard hearted person not to listen to you.

men too. so fellas...i said fellas! fellas if you got a woman and the lady don't do like
you think she should,
don't you be goin' upside of her head now. you know what i'm talkin' about, don't you be
beatin' on her. the judgement's much cheaper if you don't beat her. and you see if you hurt
her you only do one thing...i said if youhurt her you only do one thing! you make her a little
smarter and she won't let you catch her the next time. so the thing to do is throw your
arms around the pretty little thing! now listen to me, listen to me...i don't care if she
weigh thirty two and a half pounds wet or five hundred and fifty pounds on her feet. if she's
your lady and you dig her, than she's your pretty little thing...and then you tell
her! you say ""baby! baby i don't care what they say about you on the next block, your
my little lady and i dig you. let em talk, let 'em say what they want to say""
and fellas, you must know too that the ladies, god bless their sweet little souls, ladies
happen to be god's gift to man too fellas. you all agreed? you better say it cause your wife
is listening. but there's just one more thing i must say to you fellas, just one more thing.
don't be too proud to beg. i said don't be too proud to beg! if you have to fall
down on your knees to let your woman know that you love her, go on down there!
...i can see some of you cats got dirty minds in the place this evening...what i'm tryin'
to say, ladies love to hear their men say ""baby i love you!"" don't
you ladies? i said ladies love to hear their men say ""baby i love you!""
don't you ladies? so fellas tell your lady that you love her! ...she might
think you're lying though. tell your lady that you love her even if you are
lying.
but seriously speaking, when i goof, when i goof i usually slide up to my woman and i look
straight at her...i have to get my look first...i usually say i look like a little puppy begging
for that last bone you been holding out on. i look straight at her and i say ""baby! ...please
forgive me honey!"" and then i wait a few minutes to see how she take it. and then i
say ""baby! ...please forgive me honey!"" and then i stand back far enough so that when
she swings i can duck...and then i say ""baby! you know when i goofed last week i
was high...""if she let me get away with that then i look at her real pitifull like this....say
""baby, honey you know when you're high it don't count. "" and then i tell her, i say
""if you forgive me honey i'm gonna do better.""and if she look at me as if she wanna know
when then i tell her ""someday baby...""
yes someday, baby
when the blood runs cold in my veins
someday, baby
when the blood runs cold in my veins
you know you won't be able to hurt me no more baby
'cause my heart won't feel no pain"

no matter what i do
she's always on my mind
a time a day or two

you always lose
but once you've got them
you've always got the blues
in time, well you may find someone else
that can comfort you
but not someone to light the fire
no, not the way she used to do
you lose the things that made it
what it was when it was new
and once you've got them
you've always got the blues
that new love only can replace
just so much of you
that leaves a lot that gets lost between
number one and number two
in time, well you may find someone else
that can comfort you
but not someone to light the fire
no, not the way she used to do
you lose the things that made it
what it was when it was new
and once you've got them
you've always got the blues"
