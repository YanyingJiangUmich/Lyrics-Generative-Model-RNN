"don't stop the music let it play one more song
the same one that's played tonight for so long

sitting there close together she knows that not right
so don't stop the music let it play one more song
the same one that's played tonight for so long

but i want you to hear the words of that song
so don't stop the music don't make me go home
i know she's not there and i cry all night long
so don't stop the music..."
" last night i broke the seal on a jim beam decanter
that looks like  elvis
i  soaked the label  off  a flintstone jelly bean  jar
i cleared us off a place on that one little table
that you  left us
and  pulled me up a  big ole piece of  floor
i  pulled the head off  elvis
filled  fred up to his  pelvis
yabba dabba  doo, the  king is  gone
and  so are  you
 'round about 10 we all got to  talking
 'bout graceland, bedrock and  such
 the conversation finally turned to  women
 but they said they didn't get around too  much
 elvis said, ""find 'em  young""
and fred said  ""old fashioned girls are  fun""
yabba dabba  doo, the  king is  gone
and  so are  you
 later on it finally  hit me
 that you wouldn't be 'a comin' home no  more
 'cause this time i know you won't  forgive me
 like all of them other times  before
 then i broke elvis'  nose
pouring the  last drop from his  toes
yabba dabba  doo, the  king is  gone
and  so are  you
 yabba dabba  doo, the king is  gone
and  so are  you

"well i was drivin' down i 95 the other night
somebody nearly cut me right off the road
i decided it wasn't gonna do any good to get mad
so i wrote a song about him instead
it goes like this...
were you born an asshole?
or did you work at it your whole life?
either way it worked out fine
'cause you're an asshole tonight
yes you're an a s s h o l e...
and don't you try to blame it on me
you deserve all the credit
you're an asshole tonight
you were an asshole yesterday
you're an asshole tonight
and i've got a feelin'
you'll be an asshole the rest of your life
and i was talkin' to your mother
just the other night
i told her i thought you were an asshole
she said, ""yes. i think you're right.""
and all your friends are assholes
'cause you've known them your whole life
and somebody told me
you've got an asshole for a wife
were you born an asshole?
or did you work at it your whole life?
either way it worked out fine
'cause you're an aaaass...hole tonight"
"i was ridin' no 9 headin' south from caroline
i heard that lone vow vow some whistle blow
got in trouble had to roam i left my gal and left my home
i heard that lone vow vow some whistle blow
just a kid acting smart i went and broke my darling's heart
i guess i was too young to know
they took me off that georgia main locked me to a ball and chain

and my hair turns whiter than snow
i'll never see that gal of mine i'm in georgia doing time
i heard that lone vow vow some whistle blow"

for we got love and happiness people envy us you see
for we found heaven right here on earth at at 4 0 33
yes we found what most people are looking for
and it's not a lotta money to spend on a real fine car
but it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
and there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4 0 33
the four thousandth block proves what true love can do
once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
oh all around the house you can see little children play
and they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
they are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
they're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4 0 33
and our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
for look at the house they think they fell from the sky
they say that this place would make them as happy as you and me
and the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4 0 33
the four thousandth block...
oh all around the house you can see little children play...
we're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4 0 33
wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4 0 33"
"there are teddy bears & high school rings
& old photographs that mamas bring
that daddies with their young boys, playing ball.
there's combat boots that he used to wear,
when he was sent over there.
there's 50,000 names carved in the wall
there's cigarettes, & theres cans of beer
& notes that say i miss you dear
& children who don't say anything at all.
there's purple hearts and packs of gum
fatherless daughters and fatherless sons
& there's 50,000 names carved in the wall
they come from all across this land
in pickup trucks and mini vans
searching for a boy from long ago
they scan the wall and find his name
the teardrops fall like pouring rain
& silently they leave a gift and go
there's stars of david & rosary beads
& crucifixion figurines
& flowers of all colors large and small
there's a boy scout badge and a merit pin
little american flags waving in the wind"

the world had turned me down
then you picked me up
and you kissed me sweet
you changed a beggar into a king.
yes, you took the rags from off of my back
and you gave me your love to keep me warm
yes, you picked me up and you kissed me sweet
and changed a beggar into a king.
    instrumental    
i had walked the streets
with my head bowed low
the sun for me would never shine
then you came along into my life
and changed a beggar into a king.
yes, you took the rags from off of my back
and you placed the crown on my head
yes, you picked me up and kissed me sweet
you changed a beggar into a king.
you changed a beggar into a king..."
"morning comes and i'm alone ...
it's been a year since you've been gone
but it seems like yesterday ,you said goodbye
i'm finding ways to pass the time ,so i wont lose my mind
but my every waking hour i think of you
that's just a day in the life of a fool
the one who's holding out for only you
knowing all along your love for me is true
it's just a day in the life of a fool
you would think i'd learn by now , to forget it all some how .
but my favorite memories were made with you
so every moment that i have , i live them in the past
even though there’s no way back to where we were
that’s just a day in the life of a fool
the one who's holding out for only you
knowing all along your love for me is true
it's just a day in the life of a fool
it's just a day in the life of a fool"
"there's a picture that i carry,
one we made some time ago
if they ask who's in the picture with me,
i say just a girl, i used to know.
just a girl, i used to go around with
just a friend, from long ago,
i don't tell them how lost i am without her
i say she's just a girl, i used to know.
i say, she's just another girl now
just a flame, that's lost it's glow
and i say, her name has slipped my mind now,
and she's just a girl, i used to know.
just a girl, i used to spend some time with
just a friend, from long ago,
i don't talk about the nights i cry about her
i say she's just a girl, i used to know.
just a girl i used to know..."
" i can hardly bare the sight of lipstick
on the cigar  ettes there  in the ashtray
lyin? cold the way you left them
at least your lips caress  ed them  while you packed
and a  lip print on a half filled cup of coffee
that you poured and  didn?t drink
but at  least you thought you wanted it
that?s so much more than i can say  for me
chorus:
but what a good year for the  roses
 many blooms still linger  there
the lawn could stand another  mowin?
 it?s funny, i don?t even  care
and when you turned and walked  away
 and as the door behind you  closes the only thing i know to  say
 it?s been a good year for the  roses 
 after three full years of marriage
it?s the first time that you  haven?t  made the bed
i guess the reason we?re not talkin?
there?s so little left to say,  we  haven?t said
while a  million thoughts go runnin? through my mind
i find i haven?t  spoke a word
and from the  bedroom those familiar sounds
of our one baby?s cryin? goes un  heard"
"no, she not gone forever
she's just playing one of her games
and tonight when i get home
everything will be the same.
'cause when i woke up this morning
yes, i found her goodbye note
it just a game she's plays
it just a goodbye joke.
she's just goin' downtown shopping
she'll bring me back some sporty clothes
'cause i'm always on her mind
no matter where she plans to go.
if i thought she was gone forever
lord, i'd find me a hangin' rope
that's why i'm drifting now
it's just a goodbye joke.
ain't it funny the sense of humor
a woman can have sometimes
especially that lovely woman of mine.
hey, bartender won't you bring me a drink
'cause i still like ???
on the words she wrote
in her little goodbye joke..."
"people steal they cheat and lie
for wealth and what it will buy
but don't they know on the judgement day
that gold and silver will melt away
i'd rather be in a deep dark grave
and know that my poor soul was saved
than to live in this world in a house of gold
and deny my god and doom my soul
what good is gold and silver too
if your heart's not pure and true
sinner hear me when i say
fall down on your knees and pray
i'd rather be in a deep dark grave..."

"written by g. richardson and n. wilson
imagine a world where no music was playing
then think of a church where nobody's praying
if you've ever looked up at a sky with no blue
then you've seen a picture of me without you
have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing
or stood by a river where nothing was flowing
if you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
then you've seen a picture of me without you
can you picture heaven with no angels singing
or a quiet sunday morning with no church bells ringing
if you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two
then you've seen a picture of me without you"
"g c d d7
for thirty some odd years he faced a grinder in the city,
g c d d7
hustlin' day in day out just tryin' to survive,
c g
he bought his wife the finer things,and sent his kids to collage,
c am d
that always took what little bit he tried to put aside,
g c d d7
but thru it all he had one thing that seemed to keep him going,
g c d d7
a dream that someday he could leave this city life behind,
c g
i watched his hair turn thin and gray, but his dream never faded,
c d g
he told me all about it at least a thousand times.
g g7 c
he always wanted, a place out in the country,
g g7 am d
where the birds sing, in the morning,and the grass is emerald green,
g c
a place where, he could feel the mornin' sunshine,
g d g
and sit out in the evenin', where the air is, fresh and clean.
it took lots of overtime to keep his wife up with the jonses,
and more to get his son out of his run ins with the law,
the more it took the more he gave, never once complaining,
i don't know how he ever stood the pressure of it all.
i never thought he'd make it, but he finally left the city,
and now he's got that special little place to call his own,
today i took a ride out in the country just to see him,
it wasn't hard to find because his name was on the stone."
"i think you know a real close friend of mine
the girl that you described sounds so familiar
the one you say you've loved for quite some time
are you sure there's no mistake for i have a feeling
that your real love's a real close friend of mine
well i am glad we've had this little talk together
for at last i began to see the light
i've been spending many lonely nights here lately
all because of that real close friend of mine
well i'll bet she says each day her love grows stronger
and if you left she'd surely lose her mind
and if she ever makes you feel unwanted
then i think you know a real close friend of mine
yes i am glad we've had this little talk together...
all because of a real close friend of mine"
"i went to a wedding one bright summer day
the bride was a beauty and the people were g**
alone in a corner i stood till the end
for the girl was my sweetheart and the boy my best friend
when the service was over there beside the church door
i picked up a rose that laid on the floor
alone and neglected as i was that day
was my sweet little rose from the bride's bouquet
it was only a rose from the bride's bouquet
once filled with love perfume now faded and grey
like the love that she gave me it faded away
this sweet little rose from the bride's bouquet
each petal reminds me of a moment of bliss
a sweet little love word a lingering kiss
i waited in teardrops then hide it away
my sweet little rose from the bride's bouquet"
" i gave up cigarettes, haven't had to light one yet.
 it's been a year sense  i stopped.
 same goes for alcohol. i don't touch the stuff at all.
 i used to drink till i  dropped.

so good to  say.  forgetting you is not that  hard to  do

 thousand times a  day.
 friends said it would take some time to get you off my mind.
 some said i'd never let you  go. but, i guess i've proved
them wrong. one more bad habit gone.  just like the whisky and the
 smokes.  but those were tough this is  easy,  and i'm
all right i'm  ok.  forgetting 
 i've given you up for good, just like i said i would.  oh the
night you walked  away.  but that was tough this  is easy,"
"oh lend me a hand please lord and guide me
and help lead me down the road that is right
oh carry me through these hours of darkness
and show me the path the shining light
i'm a wandering soul i'm lost from my saviour
a sheep that has strayed so far from the fold
just tarrying along in the clutch of old satan
but i'm hoping someday you'll save my soul
dear lord please forgive the grief i have caused you
the thoughts of my sins that tortured my soul
oh help me to know the joy of salvation
help cleanse my life through and make me whole
i'm a wandering soul..."

in the papers i saw you this morning
you were lovely, dressed in your wedding gown
and it said you would marry a stranger to me
that had drifted into our old home town
accident'ly, you met him one ev'ning
and you say it was love at first sight
accident'ly on purpose you're marryin'
accident'ly on purpose, for spite
for you say that you saw me out painting the town
that i was just a fool with the heart of a clown
accident'ly, you were mistaken that night
accident'ly on purpose, for spite
yes, you say that you saw me out painting the town
that i was just a fool with the heart of a clown

"well i have lived a lot and done my part of running round
and never did i think i’d let a sweet love get me down
but now i see how wrong i was, you’re part of every plan
perhaps i’ll pay but come what may my heart’s at your command
oh, this aching breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
and i’m afraid to let you know i love you like i do
for if you knew how much i care i know what you would do
you’d drop me like the others and go find somebody new
last night i saw you darling in the arms of someone new
and i know that you don’t love him, you just want to make me blue
i guess you think that hurting me will make me love you more
but someday from you darling this old heart will lock its door
oh, this aching breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
and i’m afraid to let you know i love you like i do
for if you knew how much i care i know what you would do
you’d drop me like the others and go find somebody new"
"well you can find me servin' drinks inside a honky tonk
and i'll even play the jukebox on your dime
and sometimes i will dance with you to your favorite song
yeah but she'll be mine after closin' time
she will smile at all the men and shake her pretty hips
and you can yell and say she look so fine
but i'm not looking for a man i'm looking for their tips
and then she'll be mine after closin' time
when they turn the lights out that's when i'll turn him on
oh she can serve me love much better than wine
so when they close the doors i guess who takes me home
and she'll be mine after closin' time
tomorrow night i'll still be there inside the honky tonk
and i'll still play the jukebox on your dime
yeah as long as you keep buyin' drinks she'll smile and lead you on
but she'll be mine after closin' time
when they turn the lights out...
and she'll be mine after closin' time"
"here am i without your love again
oh how many times have you walked out and walked back in
and i cry just like a baby after you
oh oh it's funny what a fool will do
here am i with empty arms again
counting all the times that you walked out and walked back in
still my heart goes right on wanting you

"well i remember back in my younger days of high school
back then baseball was my biggest dream
so when i stood in line for my turn at bat
i found that wasn't where they wanted me at
i wound up totten the water for all the teams
well there ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm leavin'
there ain't nobody ever loved me very long
no matter how much i miss our show
i get kicked around everywhere i go
there aint nobody gonna miss me when i'm gone
so when my uncle sam called me to serve my country
i stood up brave and smiled and packed my duds
but to my surprise when i got there
they gave me the boots and cut my hair
i wound up scrubbin' the floor and a peelin' spuds
no ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm leavin'...
well i met me a pretty little girl one day in nashville
i loved her more than all of my wildest dreams
she took me for my money my house and my boat
and didn't even leave me a goodbye note
i gave it all up boy did she strip me clean
well there ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm leavin'
there ain't nobody ever loved me very long
no matter how much i miss our show
i get kicked around everywhere i go
there aint nobody gonna miss me when i'm gone when i'm gone
there ain't nobody gonna miss me when i'm gone
sittin' in the middle and i musta gone"
"well ever since the day that you left me i been whinin' like a little lost pup
the sun went down when you left town and you ain't a gonna come back up
a walkin' in a wearin' out leather a scuffin' up the hardwood floor
starin' at the phone since you've been gone and listenin' for the knock on the door
there ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
and they wouldn't shake if it wasn't for the breeze
there ain't nothin' happenin' with the birds and the bees
there ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves
hurt keeps a lookin' through my window the heartaches are laughin' in the hall
and i've got the news that old man blues is a seepin' through the cracks in the wall
the end is a waitin' round the corner and hope is just about gone
if you only knew how i needed you well then you'd come a running back home
oh well there ain't nothin' shakin'...
well there ain't nothin' shakin'...
no there ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves"
"i woke up with her in my arms this morning
god knows i love her over all
as she whispered she loved me your memory appeared
ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
tonight i lay here touching her sweet body
and the good familiar feeling i recall
i closed my eyes to kiss her your memory appeared
ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
you were here we loved but now you're gone
why can't you let bygones all be bygones yes and stay gone
you always find the wrong times to come around to call
ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all
ain't your mem'ry got no pride at all"

houses small
left alone

disappear
without a sound
all fall down.
 lovers meet
 lovers quarrel
 lonely boy
 lonely girl.
i loved him
and i have found,
dreams like walls
all fall down.
all fall down all fall down 
 she don`t want me to call her,
and she told me not to bother coming 'round.
all fall down all fall down 
when you take a love for granted.
like i did you`re bound to see it all fall down.
castles tall

"before you take another step there's one thing you should know
about the years ahead and how they'll be
you'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
cause all i have to offer you is me
there'll be no mansion waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers
and there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
everything i have is standing here in front of you to see
all i have to offer you is me
sweetheart i'll give you all my love in every way i can
but be sure that's what you want while you're still free
the only gold i have for you is in this wedding band
cause all i have to offer you is me
there'll be no mansion waiting on the hill...
all i have to offer you is me"
"all the love you promised would be mine forever
i would have bet my bottom dollar on
well it sure turned out to be a short forever
just once i turned my back and you were gone
from now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
i'm all through ever trusting anyone
the only thing i can count on now is my fingers
i was a fool believing in you and now you are gone
it amazes me not knowing any better
than to think i'd find a love that could be true
oh i should be taken out and tarred and feathered
to have let myself be taken in by you
from now on all my friends..."
"last night all alone in a barroom i met a girl with a drink in her hand
she had ruby red lips and coal black hair and eyes that would tempt any man
then she came and sat down at my table and as she placed her soft hands in mine
i found myself wanting to kiss her for temptation was flowing like wine
and i was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
then we danced and she whispered i need you
take me away from here and be my man
then i looked into her eyes and i saw it the reflection of my wedding band
and i was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home"
"well i plopped down in my easy chair and turned on channel two
a bad gun slinger called salty sam was a chasin' poor sweet sue

and then he grabbed her  he tied her up he turned on the buzz saw eh eh and then along came jones tall thin jones
slow walking jones  slow talking jones along came long lean lanky jones

that villain said gimme the deed to your ranch or i'll blow you all to bits
and then he grabbed her  he tied her up he lit the fuse to the dynamite eh eh and then along came jones...
well i got so bugged i turned it off and turned on another show
but there was the same old shoot em up and the same old rodeo
salty sam was a tryin' to stuff sweet sue in a burlap sack

i'm gonna throw you on the railroad track
and then he grabbed her  he tied her up a train started coming  eh eh and then along came jones..."
"they say you've found somebody new but that won't stop my loving you
i just can't let you walk away forget the love i had for you
yes i could find somebody too but i don't want no one but you
how could you leave without regret am i that easy to forget
before you leave be sure you find you want his love much more than mine
cause i'll just say we've never met if i'm that easy to forget

"amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost but now i'm found was blind but now i see
twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived
how precious did that grace appear the hour i first believed
through many dangers toils and snares i have already come
tis grace that has brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me on
when we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
we've no less days to sing god's praise than when we first begun
and than when we first begun"
"deep into midnight far from the warm light
beneath the shadow of a cold crescent moon
i watched her leaving no shouting or screaming
just the sound of our hearts as they fall out of tune
angels don't fly they just walk out the door
i know 'cause her footsteps i still hear on my floor
you migh thtink i'm crazy but i know it's true
angels don't fly they just walk out on you
now, i'm lost in my memories and smoky nights bring me
as close to the truth as any man should ever be
seems the love that i gave her could never quite save her
from a wild, restless heart that just had to be free
angels don't fly they just walk out the door
i know 'cause her footsteps i still hear on my floor
you might think i""m crazy but i know it's true
angels don't fly they just walk out on you
angels don't fly they just walk out on you..."
"i can't leave you in the morning
when you wake your child's little head looks so appealing
waddin' around in your bunny shoes
and my pajama tops you see that stay home feeling
i can't leave you in the night cause you're afraid to be alone
and there'd be tears to dry
i could never leave you crying there must be another way to say goodbye
every time i try to pack i double up inside
just like the cloths i'm folding
every empty hanger i put back
feels like a cement block my hands are holding
honey if it's all the same to you
i'd love to stay right here at least till you walk by
find an easier way of leaving there must be another way to say goodbye
there must be another way to say goodbye and make the break
there must be a bypass round the hurtin' trafic jam to take
there must be another way to part
and come unglued each time we start to try
there must be another way to say goodbye
there must be another way to say goodbye"
"any old time you wanna come back home
drive me a line i'm so lonesome since you're gone

won't you please come back cause i'm still in love with you
you'll find me here like the day you left me alone
any old time you wanna come back home

any old time you wanna come back home"
"just follow the stairway to this lonely world of mine
you'll find me waiting here in apartment no 9
not so very long ago you walked away from me
and after all the plans we made you decided to be free
loneliness surrounds me without your arms around me
and the sun will never shine in apartment no 9
i'll keep waitin' in this lonely room just in case you'd change your mind
you'll find me waiting here in apartment no 9
loneliness surrounds me...
no the sun will never shine in apartment no 9"
"i've crossed a high and mighty bridge that spans san francisco bay
saw the sun set in the west and an unforgetful way
sailed the wide pacific ocean while it was in its darkest blue
but they still have nothing like you
i've seen the bright lights of broadway in old new york town
saw a star light up the night as it came tumbling down
and the great niagara falls well i've seen them too
oh but baby there's nothing like you
i've seen a winter's day turn warm and the roses start to bud
saw the rising of the moon through a cloud red as blood
saw a rainbow of all colors when the storm and rain was through
oh but baby there's nothing like you
yes i've been most everywhere done everything there is to do
oh but baby there's nothing like you"

well it takes two hearts a cookin' to make a fire grow
and baby you've got what it takes
you know it takes a lot of kissin' to make a romance bloom
yeah yeah it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
yeah it takes a lot of woman to knock me off of my feet
and baby you've got what it takes
yeah i said mm mm mm ah ah mm mm mm
you know honey you've got just what it takes
it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
and it'd take more than a lifetime yeah to prove that i'll be true
well it takes somebody special to make me say i do
and baby you've got what it takes
c'mon now ah ah mm mm mm ah ah mm mm mm
you know honey you've got just what it takes
because it takes more than an effort...
and baby you've got what it takes"

and one short of having too few
oh my bottle of freedom is one drink from empty
and i'm back down to hung up on you
i come here to escape and some say too often
but not as much as i would like to
cause as high as i get is how low i'll be fallin'
oh back down to hung up on you
feeling nothing at all for awhile sure feels better
than the hurtin' you're puttin' me through
but as sure as i am of the sunrise tomorrow
i'll be back down to hung up on you
feeling nothing at all...
yes as sure as i am of the sunrise tomorrow
i'll be back down to hung up on you"

"they baptized jesse taylor in cedar creek last sunday
jesus gained a soul and satan lost a good right arm
they all cried hallelujah when jesse's head went under
cause this time he went under for the lord
among the local taverns there'll be a slack in business
cause jesse's drinkin' came before the groceries and the rent
among the local women there'll be a slack in cheatin'
cause jesse won't be steppin' out again
the scars on jesse's knuckles were more than just respected
the county courthouse records tell all there is to tell
the pockets of the gamblers will soon miss jesse's money
and the black eye of the law will soon be well
they baptized jesse taylor in cedar creek last sunday...
from now old nancy taylor can proudly speak to neighbors
and tell them how much jesse hooked off with little jim
now jimmy's got a daddy and jesse's got a family
and franklin county's got a lot more man

"well i'm just a bartender
and i don't like my work
but i don't mind the money at all
i've seen lots of sad faces
and lots of bad cases
of folks with their backs to the wall
but i got four walls around me, to hold my life
to keep me from going astray
and a honky tonk angel, to hold me tight
to keep me from slipping away
well i can light up your smokes
i can laugh at your jokes
i can watch you fall down on your knees
i can close down this bar
oh and gas up my car
and i can pack up and mail in my keys
now the smoke fills the air
of this honky tonk bar
and i'm thinkin' bout where i'd rather be
but i burned all my bridges
and i sunk all my ships
and i'm stranded at the edge of the sea"
"dawn breaks on the battlefield while the morning mist lays heavy on the ground
and the silence is like thunder as the enemy prepares another round
in her soft satin armor lying on the far side of the bed
wounded and heartbroken and scarred by the killing words i said
i have no rules in battle so i fire the guns of anger once again
oh she's such a little thing and there's no doubt about it i can win
but with teardrops as her weapons she easily destroys my battle plans
and then shamefully retreating i smile at her and then she takes command
and oh what a sweet surrender
i'm captured by two lips so warm and tender
she completely surrounds me with her loving arms again
it was love that brought the battle to an end
now the enemies are lovers once again"
"for over a year i've been in love with a girl so sweet
but the guy next door has declared a war and i won't retreat
he hays he could win that pretty girl love in a minute
but i'm gonna show that boy he's not a gonna win it
we're just beginning this mighty battle of love
he was once my friend through thick and thin but now i draw a line
for he wants to be my enemy and try to take what's mine
but i know his plans so i'll take my stand and defend her
he's gonna find that i'm not the kind to surrender
i'm out for winning this mighty battle of love
now his money's dream and the limousine that he drives is new
i can only offer this heart of mine full of love that's true
i know i'm right and ready to fight for my true love
he's tellin' it all over town that he's got another new love
so i've got to win this mighty mighty battle of love
now they say all's fair in love and war so may the best men win
and when they say i do i'll be glad to that to meet the best men then
if he wins her love how i ever learn to live without her
cause here she is in my arms so why should i doubt her
if i'm really winning this mighty battle of love
i'm really winning this mighty battle of love"

but you're on your way to recovery and you're not alone.
'cause nancy sure loves you and she's gonna take care of ol' jones.

oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman
if i figured them all out 'twould take many years
i once had a sweetheart, the fairest of maidens
she outshined all others that i'd known by far
i had a friend, a big fella, named big harlan taylor
harlan had a rubber tired, new shiny car
by the wants of a woman she fell for big harlan
i tried, but in vain, for to take my own life
suddenly i had lost all my will to keep livin'
she lost her desire to become my young wife
i wanted revenge and waylaid for big harlan
then i started wondrin' what good would it do
if a rubber tired, new shiny car's her ambition
then she can just have it and big harlan, too"

« © '75 tree publishing, bmi »
i remeber how your eyes used to light up all the promises that i made
but for the first time in my life i know now how it feels to be afraid
i don't know what i do if you go away this will sure be one lonely old town
for a man that's so busy going up in the world that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
i remember all the times you told me love's all that mattered to you
and looking back now wondering how i believe i had things more important to do
i can see how i must have looked to you like some fool on a merry go round
another man so busy going up in the world i couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
can't you see how everything i've learned would just be wasted if you leave me
if you'll just give it one more try i swear i'll always be here when you need me
if you can find it in your heart to firgive me i'll try to keep my feet on the ground
forgive a man so busy going up in the world that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down love coming down"

if your new romance turns out a failure here's where to find me my dear

so close yet far apart,
you had brought your lawyer
and i'd brought a broken heart,

the way you wanted him to do,

and mine from brown to blue.
i couldn't keep my tears from falling,
on the courtroom floor,
by law, they took away my rights,
to love you anymore,
my world just seemed to stop,
while i stood there so close to you,
they changed your name from brown to jones,

how i'd live my life alone,
what i would do without you
after loving you so long,

i'm seeing the road that i've travelled a road paved with heartaches and tears

and the dreams that i've made now are empty as empty as the bubbles in my beer"

we're low on heat'n oil we're low on gas
and i'm so cold i'm 'bout to freeze myself

cause the winter time sure gets cold to the bottom of my shoes
well my hands are shakin' and my knees are weak
but it ain't because of love it's from the lack of heat¨
i've got the crude oil blues
i'm gonna tell you a story bout this drunk i knew
he kept his basement full of homemade brew
but the winter got so bad it screwed up the boy's thinkin'
he got so cold he had to burn all his drinkin'
he's got the crude oil blues
he said the wintertime can sure get to the bottom of your shoes
he said burnin' this booze just destroys my soul
but there's one thing about it honey when you're cold you're cold
i've got the crude oil blues
well when we made this record there was a little bit of doubt
whether or not the thing was ever gonna come out
i said hey chief you reckon this record will be released
he said 'son we ain't got enough oil to keep the presses greased
we got the crude oil blues
and son if we can't make records then we don't need you
i said what am i gonna do if i can't sing and pick
he said 'well just keep yourself warm playin' all the hot licks
we got the crude oil blues
oh mama don't forget to bring in the brass monkey
and remember what albert winestein said

maybe by then you'll appreciate a good man
i don't know but i've heard say
every little dog is gonna have his day
you'd better pay attention and don't forget
'cause i'm just a little bitty puppy yet
i caught you honky tonking with my best friend
i shoulda quit you way back then
now i'm too old to leave you but i still get sore
when you come home feeling for the knob on the door"
"by now i bet she's wonderin' how i'm doin
if it broke my heart when she told me goodbye
well every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
i'll bet she even thinks i'm gonna miss her
she probably thinks she's always on my mind
but every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
she believes that i can't live without her
and it hurts so bad some times i almost die
well every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
you know i bet way down deep
that she thinks i'll always love her
and i'll bet she thinks i'll never
love another no matter how hard i try
but every night i sleep just like a baby
i wake up every hour and cry
lord every night i sleep just like a little bitty baby
i wake up every hour and cry"
"oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
i can see that faraway look in your eyes
i can tell by the way you hold me darling,
darlingm that it won't be long before it's crying time.
now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
and the tears are only rain to make love grow
well, my love for you could never grow no stronger,
baby, if i live to be a hundred years old.
oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
i can see that faraway look in your eyes
i can tell by the way you hold me darling,
darlingm that it won't be long before it's crying time.
now you say you've found someone you love better
that's the way it's happened every time before
and as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
crying time will start when you walk out the door.
oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
i can see that faraway look in your eyes
i can tell by the way you hold me darling,
darlingm that it won't be long before it's crying time.
no, it won't be long before it's crying time..."
"i see christian pilgrims so redeemed from sin
called out of darkness a new life to begin
were you ever in the valley when the way is dark and dim
did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him
did you ever have them laugh at you and say it was a fake
the stand that you so boldly for the lord did take
did you ever have them mock at you and say in ways quite grim
did you ever drink the cup of loneliness with him
oh my friends 'tis bitter sweet while here on earthly sod
to follow in the footsteps that our dear savior trod
to suffer with the savior and when the way is dark and dim
to think of the bitter cup of loneliness with him"
"a year and a half, did not seem like much time.
but its almost forever, when you're only nine.

as she clings to her pillow, and cries.
daddy come home oh please, daddy come home.
sweet daddy, are you out there somewhere all alone?
was mommy mean to you, did i treat you wrong?
daddy, oh daddy come home.
down on the coast, in a honeymoon sweet.
someones tossing and turning, and trying to sleep.
was that just the wind, in the pines 'cross the bay?
or the small voice, from so far away.
daddy come home, oh please, daddy come home.
sweet daddy, are you out there somewhere all alone?
was mommy mean to you, did i treat you wrong?
daddy, oh daddy, come home.
daddy, oh daddy, come home!..."

"i wanna go home i wanna go home oh how i wanna go home
last night i went to sleep in detroit city
and i dreamed about those cottonfields and home
i dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
i dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
i wanna go home i wanna go home oh how i wanna go home
homefolks think i'm big in detroit city
from the letters that i write they think i'm fine
but by day i make the cars by night i make the bars
if only they could read between the lines
cause you know i rode the freight train north to detroit city
and after all these years i find i've just been wastin' my time
so i just think i'll take my foolish pride
and put it on a southbound freight and ride
and go on back to the loved ones the ones that i left waitin' so far behind
i wanna go home i wanna go home oh how i wanna go home"
"i'm developing my pictures my mind's a dark room
the proofs i'm searching for will be made clear soon
i'm developing my pictures of the girl i admire
soon i will see you know you as you really are
i'm told you wear two faces to hide things from me
i've heard you've spoken very unkind words of me
i don't believe hear say and take what i see
but i've got to believe you love me
i'm developing my pictures...
yes i want to see you an' know you as you really are"
"i can bring you back anytime i want to
i remember an angel in your veil of white so fine
you were always very near well i feel that you're still here
it's so real in the diary of my mind
on the first page there we are down by the river
with the flowers blooming in the warm sunshine
speaking love words soft and sweet and as our lips slowly meet
we're together in the diary of my mind
yes i can bring you back anytime i want to
even though you been gone a long long time
oh i just close my eyes and then i realize
you're right there in the diary of my mind
on the next page i can smell the yellow roses
you brought to this world our baby girl so fine
a princess for the queen i was such a happy king
you're both still here in the diary of my mind
yes even comes the page i don't like to remember
the hist'ry shows that kingdoms fall with time
mistrust and deceit then the bottle it brought defeat
that's the last scene that's in the diary of my mind
but i can bring you back anytime i want to
even though you been gone a long long time
i just close my eyes and then i realize
you're right there in the diary of my mind
you're still here in the diary of my mind"
"well honey did i ever tell you just how wonderful you are
every time you hold me i'll be floatin' with the stars in the sky
i wonder why i guess it's love love love love
well baby did i ever tell you that you're the greatest guy
honey are you with me when i look into your eyes
i wonder why i wonder why i guess it's love love love love
well now don't you know you send me where i never been before
i just want to let you know i love you so
well i like to hear you talkin' but you're wastin' your time
you're not playin' nothin' that i don't already know
well baby did i ever tell you that you got what it takes
and every time you tuck me in your arms i shake
i wonder why i wonder why i guess it's love love love love
well now don't you know you send me...
i guess it's love love love love i guess it's love love love love"
"i'm dreaming tonight of the mountains that's where i long to roam
the roosters crow at the break of day in my dixie home sweet home
old people here they just don't care i never saw the beat
that road ahead is mighty long but it's dixieland for me
i'm going back to my old home in the mountains far away
where the wild red roses smell so sweet and the rippling waters play
old people here they just don't care...
this city life is not for me i'm going where the neighbors speak
that road ahead is mighty long but it's dixieland for me
old people here they just don't care...
that road ahead is mighty long but it's dixieland for me"
"don't be angry with me darling if i fail to understand
all your little whims and wishes all the time
just remember that i'm dumb i guess like any foolish man
and my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine
well i recall the first time that i flirted with you dear
when i jokingly said come and be my bride
now that time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth
that i have you dear forever by my side
maybe someday you're gonna hurt me i've been hurting of before
only god can know and time alone will tell
but in the mean time i'll be loving you with all my heart and soul
and pray god to let it last if it's his will
so don't be angry..."
"as i sat at home with my troubles today
i was tempted to walk the wrong way
i remember the voice that once led me from sin
and i heard the same voice again
don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go back to the tavern and sin
don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go back and start drinking again
i could hear lots of laughter just over the way
my friends sounded happy and g**
i started to walk but my knees gave away
as i fell i heard the voice say
don't go don't go don't go don't go just kneel by your bedside and pray
don't go don't go don't go don't go god will answer your prayers today
god freed me from sin like he did once before
now i'm happy as a man can be
god's voice sounded pleased as he spoke the next words
god must have seen a great change in me
go on go on go on go on ask your friends there to kneel down and pray
go on go on go on go on ask god will answer their prayers today"
"it sure gets lonely alone no one to talk to alone
nights sure get longer since you've gone don't leave me lonely too long
i need your arms to hold me and hear you say you need me
don't let me live on dreams alone don't keep me lonely too long
mem'ries are bad for one so lonely
my tortured heart cries out because it loves and wants you only
yes i'm too lonely alone afraid of being alone
without your love i can't go on don't leave me lonely too long
don't leave me lonely too long"
"don't let me cross over love's cheating line
i'm tempted my darling to steal you away don't let me cross over stay out of my way
you know that i love you and i'm not the stealing kind
but i'm faced with heartaches and love's cheating line
don't let me cross over love's cheating line
you belong to another and can never be mine
i know one step closer would be heaven divine
don't let me cross over love's cheating line
i've tried to forget you but what else can i do
when your eyes keep saying that you love me too
i know if i lose you not a dream will be left
i don't want to cheat dear but i can't help myself
don't let me cross over..."
"written by c.w. kemp 
when the storm clouds gather and i'm losing my mind
she stands right beside me she lights up my day
she's the one thing i found in a world that's gone wrong
she's the words and the music to the world's finest song
lord let me keep her at least for a while
i promise i'll love her 'till i've walked my last mile
when your trumpets are sounding and you've played my song
don't send me no angels 'cause i've got my own
she stayed with me thru the hard times that's still goin' on
that old feeling between us it's still comming on strong
when my eyes close forever and my last breath is gone
don't send me no angels 'cause i've got my own"
"your old cheatin' heart has finally caught you
a thousand times i told you that it would
a great big wall has come between us
and i wouldn't even love you if i could
so don't think it ain't been fun cause it ain't
don't think i still can't care cause i can't
don't think my mind won't change cause it won't
don't think i don't love you cause i don't
well all my tossing and turning nights are over
i don't even feel a touch of blues
once more i can see the sun a shining
shining though i know i'm over you
so don't think it ain't been fun cause it ain't...
don't think i don't love you cause i don't"

you make my eyes run over all the time
you're happy when i'm out of my mind
you don't love me, but you won't let me be
don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me
you must think i look bad with a smile
for you haven't let me wear one
in such a long, long while
still i keep running back, why must this be
don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me
you make my eyes run over all the time

"i've heard there's talk around
sayin' i'm out of control.
something about too many bottles
and a love that's grown cold.
but you know talk is cheap
and sometime these stories get old.
but i keep on singing my songs
and i still got some soul.
chorus:
so dream on if you think i still carry the flame.
dream on if you think that i still feel the same.
your love is just an old memory.
and i'm alright
you don't have to worry 'bout me.
i've spent my whole life going the way that i choose.
and i've tried to find a way where no one could see.
it seems unkind to know
that maybe i've done it all wrong.
when i see my life flashing before me
sometimes in these songs.
chorus:
so dream on if you think i still carry the flame.
dream on if you think that i still feel the same.
your love is just an old memory.
and i'm alright
you don't have to worry 'bout me.
so dream on if you think i still carry the flame.
dream on..."

i even filled the tank
if you're gonna drive me crazy
drive me to drink
all the mothers and your lovers
will be happy i suppose
you'll be in his arms again
and i'll be off the road
the highway will be safer
and they'll have you to thank
if you're gonna drive me crazy, baby
drive me to drink
you're in the driver's seat
it's all up to you
i'll be your dedicated man
or your designated fool

she lives south of the north pole and i know the reason why
she's my eskimo baby and i'll love her till i die
she's my eskimo baby she's my eskimo pie

i lost all my directions and i knew not where to go
when a warm hand fell upon me and a voice said with a sigh
i would take you to my igloo mister i won't let you die
well she's my eskimo baby...
and there came the day of parting and we had to say goodbye
as i crossed back o'er the river i could think i hear her cry
i know that someday i'll return i must before i die

if i don't seem to look as happy as i should
i wouldn't want to live without you i love everything about you
yes even the bad times are good
your middle name should be perfection cause that's what you are to me
even in my darkest moments you make it easier to see
i wouldn't change one thing about you if i knew that i could
yes even the bad times are good
you never let me feel mistreated your love is all i've ever needed

you're not afraid of stormy weather and that's what keeps our love together

your middle name should be perfection...

"papa brought flowers for mama today
and all the grown children, but it's not mother's day
i don't have no money, not even a dime
but i brought mama flowers like i have all the time.
everyday i pick flowers from this pretty hill
a small box of daisies and a few daffodils
i bring them to mama at the end of the day
and say flowers for mama, here's mama's bouquet.
they brighten her face and she holds me close
she'd say they are more precious than a beautiful rose
and she wore a smile sweeter than millions of flowers
a smile that i'll carry through life’s darkest hours.
spoken:
now mama was lying there, yes, they tell me she passed away
and she was surrounded by flowers that out shined my bouquet
i know mine aren't fancy but still all the while
they were placed in her hand and i know i saw mama smile.
sang:
flowers for mama i picked them today
not very much, just a simple bouquet
mom wasn't so fancy but up there above
she's the prettiest flower in god's garden of love."

the i watched her hang her dresses up and close the closet door
and i watched her put her satin things away
somehow now i know she won't be leaving anymore
i do believe forever's here to stay
it's good to hear her foot steps just walking down the hall
lord, i wondered would i hear those sounds again
we're picking up the pieces, and putting away the past
we've got a lot of broken dreams to mend"

i sincerely loved the fortune when i lost you
i would change all my decision if i had yesterday's permision
no one knows the fortune i've gone through
i never knew that i could waste you
till it was much too late to save you
like a fool i didn't know my wealth was you
there's no way to count my measure

if you go now this house will be a prison
cause it's my lifetime from here to the door
there you stand now but i guess that you're going

i'm unhappy you found someone new
i've been looking myself and if i'd find someone else
first so i'm telling is you
we're better off to have known love
we're more than we might have been
how many can say they went all the way
from strangers to lovers to friends
things could have turned out much different
we could have been strangers again
we were lucky to learn watched the bridge has been burned
only fools try to cross it again
oh i know that i'm going to miss you
and although i'm hurt now and then
i'll never regret what we went through to get
from strangers to lovers to friends
i'm not one that sorry i loved you

from strangers to lovers to friends"

it's not much, but it's the best
that i can do.""
chorus both
golden rings  with one tiny little stone
waiting there  for someone to take you home
by itself  it's just a cold metallic thing
only love can make a golden wedding ring
in a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
an old upright piano plays that old familiar tune
tears roll down her cheeks
and happy thoughts run through her head
as he whispers low, ""with this ring, i thee wed.""
chorus  both
golden ring  with one tiny little stone
shining ring  now at last it's found a home
by itself  it's just a cold metallic thing
only love can make a golden wedding ring
ooo ooo
in a small two room apartment
as they fought their final round
he says, ""you won't admit it,
but i know you're leavin' town.""
she says, ""one thing's for certain,
i don't love you any more.""
and throws down the ring
as she walks out the door
chorus  both
golden ring  with one tiny little stone
cast aside  like the love that's dead and gone
by itself  it's just a cold metallic thing
only love can make a golden wedding ring

"a long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way
and the good life he promised ain't what she's living today

she just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come
she's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world hand in hand
she's a good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man
oh he likes the night life the bright lights and good timin' friends
when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again

"some come from heaven and some crawl from hell
and the good fight the bad for your soul
bit it's hard to tell the lie from the truth
when you find one that easy to hold.
there's no way of knowing which one you been lovin'
till you leave 'em or you lose her for good
by then it's too late, you just mark it up to fate
either way, you end up a fool.
chorus:
it's a fine line between heaven and hell
when the good makes you feel like you should
it's a fine line between heaven and hell
when the bad makes you feel just as good.
a good one will love you for all that she's worth
a bad one will take you for more
a good one will cherish the key to your heart
and a bad one a key to your door.
a good one will love you for richer or poorer
but that makes the bad'er one worse
a good one will love you till death do you part
and a bad one makes sure you go first.

the rough times seem behind us and our dreams were all fulfilled
but we found out sometimes love grows old and i think our love just died

that the lord should have turned his back on me

broke the chains from mortal shame and made me free
yes he took away the sin from my soul where it had been
and he helped my blinding eyes again to see
yes and now i understand the beauty of salvation's plan
out on the cross you paid the cost and made me free
i had sunk so deep in shame never calling on his name
all the joys of life had turned to misery
but then he gave me back control of my lost and wandering soul
removed the fears dried my tears and made me free
yes he took away the sin that had stained me deep within
and he gave me back the fate that i might see
now i'm so glad i understand the promise of salvation's plan
out on the cross you paid the cost and made me free"
"written by r. v. braddock and c. putman, jr.
he said i'll love you 'til i die
she told him you'll forget in time
as the years went slowly by
she still preyed upon his mind
he kept her picture on his wall
went half crazy now and then
he still loved her through it all
hoping she'd come back again
kept some letters by his bed
dated 1962
he had underlined in red
every single i love you
i went to see him just today
oh but i didn't see no tears
all dressed up to go away
first time i'd seen him smile in years
he stopped loving her today
they placed a wreath upon his door
and soon they'll carry him away
he stopped loving her today
you know she came to see him one last time
oh and we all wondered if she would
and it kept running through my mind
this time he's over her for good"
"written by harlan howard
heartache number one was when you left me
i never knew that i could hurt this way
and heartache number two was when you come back again
you came back and never meant to stay
now i've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
ev'ryday you love me less, each day i love you more
yes i've got heartaches by the number, a love that i can't win
but the day that i stop counting, that's the day my world will end
heartache number three was when you called me
and said that you were coming back to stay
with hopeful heart i waited for your knock on the door
i waited but you must have lost your way"

"the ol' home town is sure in trouble it looks like it must have doubled
it's citysize since i been gone
the neighbors all are full of killing two million people willing
to die for something they have never known
the city streets of drunks junk and stone
a heaven made in hell they call their home
yes it's gone like the life of a child when it turn its back on your mind
tommorrow has no home sweet home look what they've done to mind
it's just faded into time
grandfather's watch he gave me is just another mem'ry
that i have kept the way it always was
and ever since he died it just wont run
i always knew i was his favorite one
that old house we used to live in the root is falling in
like every other one along the block
it took twenty years to pay and ten to rot
that says it's all just a better off forgot
yes it's gone like the life of a child..."
"my years have been many my loved ones are gone
and i miss them more every day
i'm ready to move to that heavenly home
and i yearn for the day i can say
take this ring from my finger these shoes from my feet
take all of my worldly possessions away
just leave me my bible a date i must keep
it's homecoming in heaven for me
i'll kiss my old mother shake hands with my dad
i know they'll remember their boy
we'll all be so happy and i'll be so glad
as our cup runneth over with joy
take this ring from my finger"
"well i don't know why you left me but
i do know that your gone over night you turned my life into a sad ol' song
and one way or another,
i gotta get over you
well there's only one thing left for me to do lord,
i don't wanna die of a broken heart
that would be too sad or drive my car off a cliff
well, that would just hurt too bad
and if i tied a rope around my neck, i couldn't get my breath
well i think i'll just honky tonk myself to death well,
i may get a little bit crazy but
i don't wanna go insane young women and ole whisky,
well it just may kill the pain
i'm gonna find the highest barstool and climb up to the top.
i think i'll just drink and two step until i drop lord,
i don't wanna die of a broken heart
that would be too sad or drive my car off a cliff
well, that would just hurt too bad
and if i tied a rope around my neck,
i couldn't get my breath
well i think i'll just honky tonk myself to death

i couldn't get my breath well i think
i'll just honky tonk myself to death
yeah, i think i'll honky tonk myself to death"
"i saw those blue lights flashin' over my left shoulder
he walked right up and said get off that riding mower
i said sir let me explain before you put me in the tank
she took my keys away and now she won't drive me to drink
i need a honky tonk song a cold cold beer
a hardwood floor a smoky atmosphere
a pocket full of change to last me all night long
i gotta hear old hank a moanin' a honky tonk song
he didn't show me much compassion when i tried to walk that line
as he put those handcuffs on me i said give me one more try
he never even cracked a smile when he threw me in the car
so i said sir if you don't mind oh would you drop me off in a bar
i need a honky tonk song...
i gotta hear old hank a moanin' a honky tonk song"

you loved me, or did you? i'll never be sure.
but one thing's for certain in spite of this hurtin' forever i'm hopelessly yours.
from laughing to crying from living to dying.
from heaven to heartaches i know i can't cure.
but one thing's for certain in spite of this hurtin' forever i'm hopelessly yours.
i cry on the slightest of motions cuz i'm just going through these emotions.
i love you. i hate you. forge tyou. hun but i'm afraid to. you loved me, or did you? i'll never be sure. but one thing's for certain in spite of this hurtin' forever i'm hopelessly yours. i'll always be hopelessly yours. hopelessly yours."
"for years we both have lived on pride dear and we agree that love is gone
why oh why do we keep tryin' a house without love is not a home
the love light in your eyes has faded and i'm contented just to roam
we slaved to gain a worthless treasure a house without love is not a home
no matter where our footsteps wander i know we'll both be all alone
with the pride that came between us a house without love is not a home
the simple things have gone forever we wanted wealth to call our own
now we've reached the hour of parting a house without love is not a home"
"like a raging flood that ruins a poor man's land
you keep doing things to hurt me all you can
but the thickness that we knew is growing thin
how much rain can one man stand
how much rain can one man stand
i gave you everything but my right hand
if you won't let me love you then don't let me be your friend
how much rain can one man stand
i can see them big old storm clouds movin' in
there's a stranger in your big brown eyes again
and you've told him that i'm just an old time friend
how much rain can one man stand
how much rain can one man stand...
how much rain can one man stand"
"how proud i would have been to share your life of sin
but you saw someone new, i wouldn't do for you
i wouldn't mind at all to let my morales fall
i'd like to try again, how proud i would have been
don't think that i'm above selling my soul for love
and if that's what it cost then take the price and go
without your love i'll be a whole lot less than me
i'd like to try again, how proud i would have been
a sinners just an angel that slipped and fell
for one like you i'd play a sinners part so well
i'd stoop to any length to gain your love it seems
i'd like to try again, how proud i would have been
instrumental
a sinners just an angel that slipped and fell
for one like you i'd play a sinners part so well
i'd stoop to anything to gain your love it seems
i'd like to try again, how proud i would have been"
"love on the rocks that's all he said
as he sat there beside me shaking his head
i said mister you look like you're taking it rough
the next round's on me he said i don't touch the stuff
cause these hundred proof mem'ries are stronger than wine
it don't take but one taste to send you out of your mind
no i don't want the whiskey but i could sure use a ride
cause with hundred proof mem'ries lord you don't think and drive
he said i quit drinkin' the day that she left
i come here out of habit in spite of myself
but there ain't no liquor that money can buy
that's stronger than what's bottled up inside
cause these hundred proof mem'ries...
no i don't want the whiskey..."
"well i ain't got no business doin' business today

but i always get lucky with you
i've had two strikes against me

i always get lucky with you"
"there's a love in my heart that i'd been keeping
i don't know how to give it away to someone new
oh you walked out the door and left me weeping
and i can't change overnight from loving you
if i can't walk with you then i'll walk all alone
where my feet touch the ground then that's where i'll call home
i don't like all this loneliness that i go through
but i can't change overnight from loving you
all you say to forget the lips i used to kiss
find someone to take the place of a love i once knew
yes you walked out the door and left me weeping
and i can't change overnight from loving you"

and i try just as hard as i can lord
i've searched this life for joy but mostly i found tears
so lead me home for i can't find it here
lead me home for i can't find it here
everything i've ever wanted always disappeared
take my hand and with your hand dry my tears
and lead me home for i can't find it here
for all my plans and dreams i called on you
for a simple man there's not much chance for me to do
and you've done your share lord but i'm just weak and full of fear
so lead me home for i can't find it here
lead me home for i can't find it here...
lead me home for i can't find it here"
"this morning waking up to you has made my day forever
and i could jump right up and kiss the sun
mhm loving you just has to be a nearest thing to heaven
i can't get over what lovin' you has done

and more and more of this is yet to come
if having too much love for you could be that would be never
i can't get over what lovin' you has done

when i can't get used to being all alone
i got to get used to being lonely
and say this is the last day of the year
'cause how can i look forward to tomorrow
when i can't get used to knowing i've lost you
for things to change i must help to change them

everybody says you let me down
that i should be ashamed to take you 'round
makes no difference what you used to do
darling, i could never be ashamed of you
maybe you were reckless yesterday
but together, we can find a brighter way
in my heart, i know that you'll come through
darling, i could never be ashamed of you
all the happiness i've ever known
came the day you said you'd be my own
and it matters not what we go through
darlin' i could never be ashamed of you
maybe you've been cheated in the past
and perhaps those memories will always last
even though you proved to be untrue"
"a friend of mine told me that you were down here last night
i almost called him a liar but i seen he was right,
yeah, he was right.
i'm over my anger but that's about all
it's hard to recover from that kind of fall
a fool never knows when to give up
for years i remember those long nights of love
but, i don't go back, anymore
my heart's locked it's windows and bolted it's door
it's like trying to hold back the sea from the shore
no i, don't go back anymore
you're still just as pretty as you were back then
if i didn't know you, i'd fall again
so don't smile and tell me that you still care
don't stir up my feelings, it just isn't fair
i don't go back, anymore
my heart's locked it's windows and bolted it's door
it's like trying to hold back the sea from the shore
no i, don't go back, anymore
no, i don't go back, anymore
a friend of mine told me you might be down here tonight..."

i hear the church bells ringing oh but i don't hear you

i hear the children playing i hear the clock striking two
i hear the mailman whistling oh but i don't hear you
i see little things..."
"i don't love you anymore like the way i did before
and since you've found someone new i think it's best
i don't try and walk the floor i don't love you anymore
trouble is i don't love you any less
i don't love you anymore for i've got no more love to give
you drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
i keep saying o'er and o'er i don't love you anymore
trouble is i don't love you any less
i held you close to me one time i kissed your lips and called you mine
but another came and thrilled you more i guess
i cried as you walked out the door i don't love you anymore
trouble is i don't love you any less
i don't love you anymore...
trouble is i don't love you any less"

but for the first time in my life i know now how it feels to be afraid
i don't know what i do if you go away this will sure be one lonely old town

love coming down
i remember all the times you told me love's all that mattered to you
and looking back now wondering how i believe i had things more important to do
i can see how i must have looked to you like some fool on a merry go round
another man so busy going up in the world i couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
can't you see how everything i've learned would just be wasted if you leave me
if you'll just give it one more try i swear i'll always be here when you need me
if you can find it in your heart to firgive me i'll try to keep my feet on the ground
forgive a man so busy going up in the world that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down love coming down"

mexicali women tan and tall

she's just growing through the motions gracefully
she knows she has her price to pay and lord knows i've got mine

and i think i've lost her will to let her know that i know
cause she thinks she's found the way that it won't show

and just like you i wish that he would save me
to see the day the south will rise again
daddy wore his purple heart so proudly
long before i turned into a man
and buried with our flag across his casket
i was still too young to understand
i still sing the old songs that you taught me...
mama spent her last days in the garden
while i took my turn behind a gun
lord i'd give my life to find the freedom
lost within the old songs that you sung
i still sing the old songs that you taught me..."

i wonder if you think i'd do the same by you
i take the chance of causing you to doubt my love
i take the chance to be with you
i know it's wrong for us to steal a kiss
and when you hold me in your arms i can't resist
i have a home and someone kind and true
i know i'd lose it all if i was seen with you
i take the chance to lose my soul my life my pride
i take the chance to be with you"
"written by merle haggard
once i lived a life of wine and roses
i drank a lot back then for one concern
success for me lay just around the corner
i thought my social friend would help me make the turn
but now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
a victim of the drunken life i chose
now all my social friends look down their noses
for i kept the wine and threw away the rose
i stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
the turn i made was not the one i planned
and i watched my social standings slip away from me
as i slowly watched the bottle take command
and now i'm paying for the days of wine and roses
a victim of the drunken life i chose
now all my social friends look down their noses"
"rivers turn to oceans and flow on to the sea, embers turn to ashes, and love to memories. rain turns to rainbows and gray skies turn to blue. but when the world turns on me i turn to you.
a thirsty man needs water. a bluebird needs the sky. a man needs his woman or he'll wither up and die. roses need sunshine. violets need the dew. but not half as much as i need you.
deep in my soul, and always on my mind, forever in my heart, you're the light that shines. someone to hold when no one else will do. when the world turns on me i turn to you. when the world turns on my i turn to you."

i remember wearin' straight leg levis and flannel shirts
even when they weren't in style
i remember singin' with roy rogers at the movies
when the west was really wild
and i was listenin' to the opry
when all of my friends were diggin' rock 'n roll
and rhythm & blues
i was country, when country wasn't cool
i remember circlin' the drive in, pullin' up
and turnin' down george jones
i remember when no one was lookin'
i was puttin' peanuts in my coke
i took a lot of kiddin'
'cause i never did fit in
now look at everybody tryin' to be what i was then
i was country, when country wasn't cool
i was country, when country wasn't cool
i was country, from my hat down to my boots
i still act, and look the same
what you see ain't nothin' new
i was country, when country wasn't cool
they call us country bumpkins
for stickin' to our roots
i'm just glad we're in a country
where we're all free to choose
i was country, when country wasn't cool"
"we both have a morning cup of coffee
and with tender love you reach and touch my hand
and my son comes in and says good morning daddy
and i say how's daddy's little man
then i woke up from dreaming i woke up from dreaming
i keep dreaming you're not gone but i'd found myself alone
when i woke up from dreaming
we're both making plans for the future
of the joy that we want to give our son
we'd say almost enough to buy a new home
a home filled with love and fun
then i woke up from dreaming...
then i woke up from dreaming"
"do you think i'll keep on waitin' for your love while you keep date
other fellows in this town that think you're free
i can't give something dear for nothing surely this time i'm not bluffing
i won't love you any more than you love me
you like worldly ways and riches pretty clothes and fancy stitches
and you think you're living best with all of these
but i know one thing for certain my old heart can't stand this hurtin'
it's not right to love you more than you love me
i can't run around with everyone to play with you
so why must i be the one who's always so confused
this love affair is far from even and i believe in even steven
i won't love you any more than you love me
it's not right to love you more than you love me"
"do you remember how you felt when you kissed your brand new bride
or the feeling that ran through you when you held your new born child
and when he called you daddy did you feel ten feet tall
well i heard about a man who must have had the greatest thrill of all
john was just an ordinary man like you and me
and he did lotta preaching near the sea of galilee
well he must have been a pretty good preacher he sure could tell the news
but he said there's a man coming after me and i can't tie his shoes
i wonder how john felt when he baptized jesus
hod did he feel when jesus came and said let it be done
i wonder how john felt when he led him in the water
don't you know it was a blessin' to baptize god's only son
john walked to a lot of people and many saw the light
but what about walking up and shaking hands with jesus christ
i wonder if he trembled when he first saw the man
don't you know he felt the spirit when he touched the master's hand
i wonder how john felt when he baptized jesus...
i wonder how john felt when he baptized jesus..."
"you're my always and forever.
you're the one that hung the moon.
after all these nights together
i still get lost in your perfume.
and if i could write a love song,
every line would tell the truth.
it would be a warm and soft one
and my heart would say to you
when you see me walk on water,
when the sea don't reach the shore
when the fires of hell freeze over,
i won't need you anymore
oh, the feelings lay so easy,
lyin' here the way we are.
no one else could ever hold me
like the heavens hold the stars.
when you see me walk on water,
when the sea don't reach the shore
when the fires of hell freeze over,
i won't need you anymore
i won't need you anymore"
"i been lonely much too long i'd give a yankee dime if you come back home
honey won't you let me hold you tight
tears keep a fallin' my eyes are blurred if i had the wings of a pretty little bird
i would fly right to your arms tonight
i'd jump the mississippi deep and wide if you was a waitin' on the other side
honey just to hug and hold you tight
i'd jump across and never get wet right there by your side i'd set
yes indeed everything would be alright
if you would come back home to me make me happy like i used to be
i'd start and meet you halfway
i'd leave here and never look back i'd run a mile in a minute flat
to get to you before the end of day
i'd jump the mississippi deep and wide...

"i'd rather die young than grow old without you
so don't ever leave me whatever you do
though others may tempt you and tell you they care

to see someone's picture where my picture hung
believe me my darling i'd rather die young
don't leave me never leave me please don't leave me never leave me

dying to be with me watching tv with me

well i'd rather have what we had

"you can take me to the top of the tallest buildin'
and push me off and watch me go
take me to a busy street tie my hands and my feet
and lay me where the heaviest trafic flows
take me out into the deepest part of the wild blue ocean
wrap me up in chains and drop me in
but i won't be gone long cause my love is just that strong
i'll come back and love you again
lock me inside a cage with the meanest kind of tiger
throw the key away and let me be
take me to a desert spot where the sun is oven hot
and leave me with no water there for me
take me to the north pole just as far as you can go
and dress me up in cloths that turn and bend
but there is nothin' you can do to keep me away from you
i'll come back and love you again
well who did it and who done it has never done the things i would do
before you count one two three turn around and you'll see
me standing there smilin' right at you
put me in a rocket ship on my way to the moon
and let the final count down begin
got me two railroad tracks but i'll find my way back

and if there's anything you owe me
darling i'll just take it out in love
i've been your friend when you were troubled
and i've stood by you when things went wrong
i've picked you up each time you stumbled
when you were weak then i was strong
but darling you don't need to thank me...

if i were your love then i wouldn't be lonely
wishful thinking in a world of fantasy yes someone you just forgot
and you only might as well believe for i can be something that i'm not
if i were your picture your love for me would always last
if i were your love then i wouldn't be just your past
if i were your love then i wouldn't be just your past
no if i were your love then i wouldn't be just your past"
"i kicked down the door in the middle of the night
and still you're right out of his bed
i'd do anything that i had to do
if only you'd love me again
i asked him to meet at the street at high noon
and i'd leave him to die in the sand
i should to kill i'd rob and steal
if only you'd love me again
i'd never swallow another drop from the bottle
i'd pour it off down the drain
i'd be the man that i should have been
if only you'd love me again
in my shining armor i'd ride to your resque
and fight till the dragon was slain
then i'd be you hero instead this zero
if only you'd love me again
i'd be the man that i should have been
if only you'd love me again"
"girl i can tell that you're thinking of leaving. but it'll hurt me so much you don't want me to know. you've done all you can to hide what you're feeling. oh but one part of you, it let's your feelings show.
chorus:
oh your fingertips tell me you'll stay. and your warm red lips say you won't go away. and your lovin' arms make me think you're still mine. whoa girl, if only your eyes could lie.
so i say what's wrong and darlin' you just say it's nothin'. i can almost believe it hun when i hold you like this. but i know in my heart that there's no tomorrow. so just for tonight hun i'll pretend that there is.
repeat chorus
whoa girl, if only your eyes could lie."
"oh the promise of tomorrow will banish all your sorrow
no need to grieve if you believe
there will be a brighter future and a way prepared
to suit your every need if you believe
if you believe so will it be it's true for you it's true for me
somewhere down that narrow road he'll relieve your heavy load
life's supreme reward receive if you believe
if your life is not inspiring and your days are long and tiring
rest receive when you believe
nothing here below can measure up to heaven's lasting treasure
be not deceived only believe
if you believe so will it be..."
"funny a woman can come on so wild and free
yet insist i don't watch her undress or watch her watch me
and stand by the bed and shiver as if she were cold
and just to lie down beside me and touch me as if i were gold
one night of love don't make up for six nights alone
but i'd rather have one than none lord i'm flesh and bone
though sometimes it seems she ain't worth the trouble at all
she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
but right or wrong a woman can own any man
she can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand
then leave him as weary and weak as a wet newborn child
fightin' to get his first breath and open his eyes
one night of love don't make up for six nights alone...
one night of love don't make up for six nights alone..."

wel all got together there under a tent
and listened to the man that jesus sent
for god put in his mouth these words to say

"you gave the heart you gave to me in person
you made the vows you made to me in person
then when your love has lost all its glow
you said your friend to let me know
i wish you would have told me so in person
i placed my ring upon your hand in person
i should have got it back again in person
but so afraid my tears would start
you said your friend to do your part
you really should have broke my heart in person
if love is gone then i can't understand
but it hurts so much to hear it second hand
i once appeared at your front door in person
but i won't appear there anymore in person
and though you send someone you knew
to tell me that our love was through
i know i'll still be missing you in person
i know i'll still be missing you in person"
"i come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses
and the voice i hear falling on my ear the son of god discloses
and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me i am his own

he speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds hush their singing
and the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing
and he walks with me and he talks with me..."

but as long as you can't buy the springtime in virginia
it ain't gonna worry it ain't gonna worry me no it ain't gonna worry my mind
love is all that ever made you richer if the truth be told
moonlight's been my only silver the sun my only gold
go on wishing go on praying go on saying i'll hit bitter times
but how in the world could she love me any better
lord it ain't gonna worry it ain't gonna worry lord no it ain't gonna worry my mind"

it breaks my heart to know how much i made you cry
and if you'll let me show you darling i'll right the wrongs i've done
and ease the heartaches i have caused in the days gone by
you told me that our love was cold and then you said goodbye
but i can't love another i'd be living a lie

first time i laid eyes on you i saw it
shining in your eyes was bright as day
and when i held you in my arms i felt it
oh but like a fool i let it slip away
we don't know what it was but we had it...
first time that we kissed i could taste it
sweet upon my lips like a song
the moment we made love i knew we found it
one day i woken up and it was gone
we don't know what it was but we had it...
if you had one more chance would you take it
and would you stand beside me from now on
the second time around could we make it
and would you be there with me hold it on
we don't know what it was but we had it...
no we don't know what it was but it sure was good"
"it's a sin my darling how i love you because i know our love can never be
it's a sin to keep this mem'ry of you when silence proves that you've forgotten me
the dream i built for us has tumbled each promise broken like my heart
it's a sin my darling how i love you so much in love and yet so far apart
i'm sure you're happy with another who shares the love i can't win
why pretend that i can't live without you when deep inside i know that it's a sin"
"darling i've loved you all of these years
and you've never once caused the heartbreak or tear
without you to love me oh what would i do it's been a beautiful life loving you
and darling i love you more every day and i'll stand beside you each step of the way
you've made it heaven my dreams have come true it's been a beautiful life loving you
if ever i need you you're always there life is much sweeter knowing you care
always together till life is through it's been a beautiful life loving you"
"it's been so long darling since i had to go away
it's been so long darling and i can't forget that day
although you never mentioned it you cried that whole day long
it's been so long darling but now i'm coming home
it's been so long darling since i gazed into your eyes
it's been so long darling do you really realize
that got the thought of seeing you it scares me through and through
it's been so long darling since i had a kiss from you
it's been such a long time darling but it won't be long now
it's been so long darling but i've kept every vow
i pray that you'll be waiting as you did in days gone by
it's been such a long time darling please don't blame me if i cry"
"it's so sweet to love you darling love we thought we'd never find
all the happiness you give me just to know your love is mine
love is such a happy feeling one can feel love through and through
when together there is nothing that can bother me and you
it's so sweet...
nothing tempts our love to woman for we love too much to stray
hold my hand if you should weaken love grows stronger day by day
it's so sweet..."

"i once was lost in sin but jesus took me in
and then a little light from heaven filled my soul
it bathed my heart in love and it wrote my name above
and just a little talk with my jesus made me whole
have a little talk with jesus tell him all about our troubles
hear our fainted cry answer by and by
feel a little prayer wheel turning know a little fire is burning
find a little talk with jesus makes it right
sometimes my path grows drear without a ray of cheer
and then a cloud of doubt may hide the day
the mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies
but just a little talk with jesus clears the way
have a little talk with jesus...
i may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
but jesus is a friend who watches day and night
i go to him in prayer he knows my every care
and just a little talk with my jesus makes it right
have a little talk with jesus...
find a little talk with jesus makes it right"

while doing without for my foolish dream
she found some rainbows i couldn't see
while she learn to do without so many things

while she learn to do without so many things

"i have found a friend in jesus, he’s everything to me,
he’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
the lily of the valley, in him alone i see,
all my needs to cleanse and make me fully whole.
in sorrow he’s my comfort, in trouble he’s my stay,
he tells me every care on him to roll;
he’s the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star,
he’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
he will never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,
while i live by faith and do his blessed will;
a wall of fire about me, i’ve nothing now to fear,
from his manna he my hungry soul shall fill.
then sweeping up to glory to see his blessed face,
where the rivers of delight shall ever roll;
he’s the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star,
he’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul..."
"won't you beckon to our lonely christmas call?
you left a year ago this christmas and we're wondering if you miss us.
don't know why you up and left and went away.
the kids are lonely here without you, even wrote old santa about you.
please don't leave them all alone this christmas day.
don't you miss their arms around you? do their memories surround you?
don't you know it's not their fault things are this way?
why not show consideration to the ones whose heart you're breaking?
give them your gift of love this christmas day.
if you could see their little faces, as round the tree they take their places,
they're looking for the biggest gift of all.

i'm lookin' for that lonely street
i've got a sad, sad tale to tell
i need a place to go and weep
where's this place called lonely street
a place where there's just loneliness
where dim lights bring forgetfulness
where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
where's this place called lonely street
perhaps upon that lonely street
there's someone such as i
who came to bury broken dreams
and watch an old love die
if i could find that lonely street
where dim lights bring forgetfulness
where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
where's this place called lonely street"

he said that he saw her by the neon lights
it's a lonesome old town tonight

they're too far away for me to see who they are
i'm gonna go down so they will be in sight

each way we look we see rainbow
my heart is yours and yours is mine
each way we turn we turn to happiness
in a world where we don't stand alone

over promises that i made
but for the first time in my life
i know now how it feels to be afraid
i don't know what i’d do if you go away
this would sure be one lonely old town
for a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
i remember all the times you told me
love's all that matters to you
and looking back now, wondering how i believed
i had things more important to do
i can see how i must have looked to you
like some fool on a merry go round
and that a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love going down
love going down
can't you see how everything i’ve learned
would just be wasted if you leave me
if you just give one more try
i swear i’ll always be here when you need me
if you can find it in your heart to forgive me
i'll try to keep both my feet on the ground

there ain’t no diamond
that ever has sparkled
there ain’t no star that shines

i’ve had some good friends
turn out to be strangers
funny how quickly they turn
and i’ve had some lovers

how easy it is to get burned
in this world of glitter
and cosmetic people
there’s one thing that’s real in my mind
it’s the love in your eyes
it’s the love in your eyes
there ain’t no diamond
that ever has sparkled
there ain’t no star that shines

and loose my direction
sometimes i go over the line
but it’s such a comfort
and it’s such a blessing
to know that you’re there all the time
and i feel i’m driftin’
on a sea of confusion
there’s a beacon that always shines
it’s the love in eyes
it’s the love in eyes
there ain’t no diamond
that ever has sparkled
there ain’t no star that shines

like the love in your eyes
it’s the love in your eyes
the love in your eyes"

to hold you to kiss you again
i thought that you were gone for ever but at last here we stand

to lose love then have love again
you look as warm as i remember come to me and take my hand
you bring happiness to my world and love lives again

there beneath the stars an indian maiden divine
the moon is on high and seems to see her there
in her eyes there's a light shining ever so bright
as she whispers a silent prayer
every word reveals an empty broken heart
broken by fate that's keepin' them so far apart
lonely there she kneels and tells the stars above
in her arms he belongs and her prayer is a song
her undying song of love
every word reveals an empty broken heart..."

there's too much at home to remind me that we're through

i'm not wishing for a bygone day

with his last breath he said i'm goin' to the promised land
that's when mama told us all that she had heard the call
and mama would be a preacher man
far as i can remember back mama was a woman that dressed in black
with the sould filled full of gospel and the bible in her hand
she would go from town to town spreading god's word all around
yes mama was a real strong preacher man
mama was a preacher man mama was god's right hand
mama really knew just how to reach way out
mama was a preacher man mama was god's right hand
mama knew what the holy word was all around
i sit there on the very first row as she pleaded to lost souls
tellin' them about jesus there in the holy land
although mama past away she still lives on today
yes mama was an old time preacher man
mama was a preacher man mama was god's right hand...

and daddy's hands lost everything to a hand of kings and three's
and daddy's hands they shook so bad that he turned to wine
but mama's hands were strong and calm as they held on to mine
yes mama's hands held on to mine to guide me day and night
and it took the schem of mama's hands to teach me wrong from right
when times were bad and money's slim she'd fold her hands in fray
ands somehow she would make the food hold out another day
now mama's hands they tremble when she prays
but her voice is strong as she thanks god for the bygone days
she looks at me and then she smiles she knows i understand
that everything i am today i owe to mama's hands
everything i am today i owe to mama's hands"

he looked down and grinned when i said i'm your biggest fan
and i was there the day when jfk rode into dallas
i walked up to the limousine and shook his mighty hand
i've met the famous and i've met the best

and the movie house is all boarded up where we sat side by side
and the sign that said state champions is covered up with dust

but then a third heart came along and now our love is gone
i count the many times i said i love no one but you

divide the tears by everytime a heart breaks
the answer only tells that it's too late
subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
subtract one love and multiply the heartaches...

don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
dry all the raindrops then hold back the sun

the mailman brings a letter just like he did before
they seem so busy all day long as though there's nothing wrong
don't they know the world has ended my baby's gone
hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still...
i'll wake up sometime in the night and realize you're gone
and then i toss upon my bed and wait for day to come
i try to tell my lonely heart it must go on alone
but it cries the world has ended my baby's gone
hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still...
my world has ended my baby's gone"

lately i don't even miss her
yes it's true, out of sight and out of mind
all my love, yesterday, it has faded away
i'd be lonely if i could find the time
helped her open the door when she left me
all i said was good luck and goodbye
now at last i am free like i've wanted to be
these are a few of my favorite lies
i'm surprised i'm still talking about her
for i can stop any time, and i will
but if you feel like asking me questions

growing in a field of love one day
when she told me that she love me then i knew that i must have her

i picked her from the field of love one day
well i loved her then and i love her still cross my heart i always will

we have faced the years together sharing all our joy and sorrow
she has been my pride along the way
through it all she has advantage never one time has she failed it
since i picked her as my heart's bouquet
she's my heart's bouquet...
when old ages crept upon us and the years show in our faces
and her golden hair has turned to grey
she'll still be my precious darling and i love her more than ever
just the same she'll be my heart's bouquet
she's my heart's bouquet..."

"my brand new car has a dent in the fender
i'm so mad i could shout
but there's no need for me to complain
for she'll do it the very next time out
just a while ago my banker told me
that again we were overdrawn
she writes to many checks but what the heck
my loving wife has never done me wrong
the food she prepares i know ain't the best
that's ever been put on a plate
and hour by hour she's by the telephone
that's her favorite gossip place
the house stays messed up most all of the time
it's a site for friends to come around
i know things aren't spick and span but on the other hand
my loving wife has never left me down
and she loves me that makes everything alright
she's alway there waiting for me when i come home at night
the clothes she buys cost me way to much
but i know that it's me she dresses for
she may not have perfect ways but i tell her everyday
my loving wife i love you like you are"

if you wanna see a heartbreak right in two in front of you
just hang around my tears are overdue
now there's not a way that i can say how much it really hurts
when a broken heart and guilty conscience starts to work
i hope you won't forget the sight you see today
just remember love i had then threw away
if you're not afraid my misery might rub off on you
just hang around my tears are overdue just hang around my tears are overdue"

accident'ly nailed my index finger to the wall
cut off all my toes and soaked my foot in alcohol
i've had my pelvis ruptued by an angry kangaroo
but nothing's ever hurt me half as bad as losing you

it's surely not because you own a chain of liquor stores
it's not because your daddy is the richest man in town
it's just that i've grown used to you and having you around
i've had my parents tell me son we don't love you at all
i've seen my sister's name written on a washroom wall
my best friend set my barn on fire burned my horse to death

she cried all the way to the chapel, like she really cared for ol' frank. she cried all the way to the grave where he lay. then she smiled all the way to the bank.
he had bought her big diamonds and long limousines as she taught him what happiness meant. lord he spent a fortune on his prized possession. and to him she was worth every cent. now ol' frank is gone and the whole town's still talkin'. they think what she did is a disgrace. there are many who think that she killed poor ol' frank but he died with a smile on his face.

"i remember them so clearly mom and dad loved them so dearly
old brush arbors by the side of the road
where i learned about salvation from the book of revelations
in an arbor by the side of the road
old brush arbors by the side of the road
where a sinner could lay down his heavy load
it was in those old brush arbors troubled souls found peaceful harbors
brush arbors by the side of the road
many times i have departed from the way of life i started
in an arbor by the side of the road
but each time the devil's caught me i remembered what they taught me
in brush arbors by the side of the road
old brush arbors by the side of the road
where the mighty light of god's great mercy flowed
there was prayin' shoutin' singin' till the country side was ringin'
brush arbors by the side of the road
old brush arbors by the of the road"

and on that hand i see no reason why it's wrong

to remind of someone who would not understand
on one hand i could stay and be your loving man
but the reason i must go is on the other hand

when i looked into your eyes i found myself
when i first kissed your lips i felt so alive

and one mistake don't mean you've failed the test
and as you lay beside me softly sleeping this i know
there's nothing better once you've had the best
within your arms i've had the best and i think the world should know
i don't care what you've said or done i'll always love you so
you've got more love in your little finger than all the rest

"what goes wrong with the mind of a man in a bar
who sits and keep drinking with his thoughts strayed so far
it's the same old sad story that has often been told
one drink then another till he's out of control
as he sits at a table with his hands on the glass
for him there's no future there's only the past
he reaches for the bottle but his hands don't take hold
his eyes just can't focus he's out of control
does he search for contentment that he might hope to find
from a honky tonk woman or the bottles of wine
he shakes and he trembles even though he's not old
like a leaf in a whirlwind he's out of control
yes i'm just like that fellow who sits there all alone
with no one to love me no family at home
i'm a picture of others with a future so cold
a life ain't worth livin' when it's out of control"

don't hang your head when you walk by honey let it show on you
so hold me close and don't let go darling even if you should
and don't you let yourself feel bad over something good
over something good i know you're feeling bad

keep yourself from feeling bad over something good
oh the things would be much better darling if you only could
keep yourself from feeling bad over something good"

and your disposition suits me to a t
and nothing gives me greater satisfaction than knowing that you feel the way you do
cause it makes my life worth living and i get a thrill from giving
all my love to you and only you
you and me together we're a perfect match
in each other we have found a perfect catch
like two ol' birds on the eggs of happiness knowin' they're gonna hatch
you and me together we're a perfect match
you know just what i need and when i need it
with you contentment it wasn't hard to find
and though we have our problems we let love and kindness solve 'em
you think that we could read each other's minds
sometimes i think that we should start all over
i'll bet we wouldn't want to change a thing
through the good times and the bad ones just a few real sad ones
we found happiness that only true love brings
you and me together...
you and me together we're a perfect match"
"imagine a world where no music was playing
then think of a church where nobody's praying
if you've ever looked up at a sky with no blue
then you've seen a picture of me without you
have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing
or stood by a river where nothing was flowing
if you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
then you've seen a picture of me without you
can you picture heaven with no angels singing
or a quiet sunday morning with no church bells ringing
if you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two
then you've seen a picture of me without you
then you've seen a picture of me without you"

good night angel, sleep tight darlin'
close your pretty brown eyes.
when the show is over,
your radio lover
will be home by your side.
she's laying in bed as her dj tells her that he loves her.
it would break his heart if he knew she wasn't there alone.
she knows when to cheat and when to tell her lover to leave her.
she knows they'll be safe just as long as his show goes on.
he planned a surprise for the night of their first anniversary.
he taped his show just so he could be home.
the radio was playing and, as he walked in on her and her lover,
he heard himself saying the last words that they ever heard."

my foot on the rail, just a thinkin' 'bout you

i know relief   is just a swallow away
well, i looked down the bar and what did i see
your sad lookin' face a lookin' back at me
wishin' you could turn time a few hours back
get off of that one way track

you're as close to me as i am to you

and settled me down with her charms
it's easy to see how she's done me
but right now i'd come back and melt in her arms
doing without her ain't easy time didn't make me forget
tonight i'm feeling so lonely cause i'm not over her yet
so many times she's hurt me when she never meant any harm
and i left what i thought was over

"written by bob wills
(as performed by ray price on
""san antonio rose   a tribute to the great bob wills"")
spoken intro:
hi, neighbors, this is our new album
and we've chosen songs from the great bob wills
who is a legend
as far as we in the business are concerned
and i know, people across the united states
you know, we finally call him the ""old man""
because to us, that's just what he is
you'll always know him by the lonesome fiddle
the white hat, the high heeled boots
the cigar smoke, and some of these wonderful songs
we hope you like our version of 'em
as we pay tribute to one of the greatest of all time bob wills
deep within my heart lies a melody
a song of old san antone
where in dreams i live with a memory
beneath the stars all alone
it was there i found beside the alamo
enchantment strange as the blue up above
a moonlit path that only she would know
still hears my broken song of love
moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
call back my rose, rose of san antone
lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
speak once again of my love, my own
broken song, empty words i know
still live in my heart all alone
and that moonlit pass beside the alamo
and rose, my rose of san antone"
"how many times have you heard someone say
if i had his money i could do things my way
but little they know that's so hard to find
one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
once i was waiting in fortune and fame
everything that i dreamed of to get a start in life's game
but suddenly it happened i lost every dime
but i'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
money can't buy back your youth when you're old
or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
the wealthiest person is a pauper at times
compared to the man with a satisfied mind
when my life's ended and my time has run out
my friends and my loved ones i'll leave there's no doubt
but one thing for certain when it comes my time
i'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind"
"darling there's talk around town bout a girl who spreads love around
with soft lips and eyes crystal blue darling please say it's not you
they say that she comes in alone and stays till self respect is gone
and each night she leaves with someone new darling say it's not you
then at first what they said didn't hurt me until they mentioned her name
then slowly the tears overtook me her name and yours is the same
each night till the breaking of dawn i'm prayin' that you're not the one
tell me lies but say it's not true darling say it's not you
darling say it's not you"
"searching i've spent a lifetime darling
searching looking for someone like you
dreaming in all my dreams i dream that someday
i'd find someone like you
other loves have come my way but they were not for me
tell me that you're here to stay don't ever set me free
cause i've been searching i've spent a lifetime darling searching
looking for someone just like you
other loves have come my way..."

"i was working in miami for a day or two
i decided i'd look up a girl that i once knew
i bought some flowers and went to see a girl i used to know
the lady at her door said she had married long ago
times will change and towns will change there i was alone
and suddenly i wondered would susie be at home
so with some flowers in my hand i walked toward her gate
someone touched me on the arm and said you'll have to wait
then i noticed there were people standing in the line
some of them were holding pretty flowers just like mine
they explained that susie had been in an awful crash
doctors said that she had just a little while to last
when i walked into her room i felt the sense of shame
but i heard susie whisper i'm awfully glad you came
she had been the girl that i had always gone to see
when someone that i cared for had been untrue to me
i handed her the flowers and she gently kissed my hand
she said don't be embarased for you know i understand
i said goodbye and as i bent to kiss her fevered brow
i heard her whisper thank you for the second handed flower"
"darling look what you've done to my life the change is plain to see
you took each part of this broken heart and made a new man of me
when i thought that all was lost just look at what i've found
you're living with what love can do the second time around
mistakes i made in my younger days and times that passed seemed high
but the bridge i've burned was a lesson i've learned and i get it right this time
i'll be the man you see in me and i'll never let you down
you gave my heart a brand new start the second time around
every dream i ever dreamed and my first one to come true
i've never heard more sweet words than when we said i do
and when it's all said and done if this old world let's me down
god above will bless our love the second time around
god above will bless our love the second time around"
"you may think she ain't been true all those things she's telling you
but believe me what she says is really true
cause i'm the one who left her there i'm the one who didn't care
and she know what she's crying about
she knows what she's crying about
she bears the pain though i'm to blame there's no doubt
i never even tried to say or acceptted love she gave
and she knows what she's crying about
she gave me her very best i was so wrong to give the rest
all the love that she so desperately tried to hold
i made her shade a million tears all i did was waste her years
and she knows what she's crying about
she knows what she's crying about...
yes she knows what she's crying about"
"she may not be the girl that i'll marry
but we still get together sometimes
i'll admit i don't like what she stands for
but she loves me right out of my mind
i'm looking for someone who's gentle
and someone who's so sweet and kind
but she sure feels devoid when i'm lonesome
and she loves me right out of my mind
she never claimed to be an angel and an angel she'll never be
but when we're alone and i hold her she brings out the devil in me
when i look into her eyes i see a woman
and even if she's not my kind
she's got something i need so i'll take it
and let her love me right out of my mind
she's the best thing the world has to offer
and she loves me right out of my mind"
"no i don't know the girl at the bar in the short red dress
i haven't had the chance to get acquainted with her yet
but i can tell that she's lonely by the sadness in her eyes
and she needs more than just a drink tonight
she needs me to give her love and understanding
some good old country love and nothing else
she needs me to throw my loving arms around her
and tonight i could use some love myself
it's time she turns up the glass she drinks a mem'ry from the past
and sadness becomes a teardrop in her eye
but she won't have to leave alone cause toning i'm takin' her home
wrapped up in these lonely arms of mine
for she needs me to give her love and understanding...
yes tonight i could use some love myself"
"a mayor gave me the keys to the city
no welcome wagons already appear
but again i'll be packing and leaving

cause she's love and love lives everywhere
could it be that i'll always be saying
i got to go for she once lived here
i see her face in the cool of the evening
i hear her voice in each breathe that care
oh there must be a town without memories
but not this one for she once lived here
i got to go now for she once lived here"

she's not a dancer and she don't drink at all
no i don't know her number if i were i wouldn't call
it's best you didn't know her and i'll tell you why
did you know she once made a romeo cry
she's just another girl that once told me goodbye
i called her juliet just a name out of the sky
pardon me for a moment i feel something in my eyes
did you know she once made a romeo cry
did you know she once made a romeo cry"
"well you asked me to tell you about her
since we have been friends for so long
well she's really an outstanding woman
more precious than any i've known
she's soft she's kind and she's gentle
she likes to be loved tenderly
she's the kind you won't ever get over
and she should belong to me
don't leave her at night she'll be frightened
she's afraid when the darkness sets in
and blue is her favorite color
and she prefers home loving men
she likes roses on special occasion
champagne makes her laugh and feel free
she wants to be held when she's lonely
and she should belong to me
she should be here with me in these two arms of mine
happy like we used to be
she no longer needs me i've run out of time
oh she should belong to me
oh she should belong to me"

and there's not one star in heaven and eight don't follow seven
but i'd believe it if she told me so

i won't say that i'm the only one who loves her

there's someone she can't forget
i know she never will, and yet
but as far as my heart's concerned, she's mine
she never once has told me that she needs me
and she forgets when i'm around her all the time
there are words i try to say
when she turns and walks away
but as far as my heart's concerned, she's mine
she's mine and yet i know someday i'll lose her
but she'll never take this happiness i've found
and i know it may sound foolish when i tell you
that i'm satisfied just having her around
even when she's in my arms i know she's lonely
i wish that i could take that someone from her mind

she's been daddy's little girl"
"i'm thinking of a little lady she bears her load without a friend
the one who rocked me in my cradle and through the years she loves me yet
the roses on her cheeks have faded and when they pass her on the street
would break my heart to see them mock her although she may not dress so neat
she was the first to ever love me the first to hold me to her breast
god bless her cause she is my mother and she'll be the last one i'll forget
her way may seem a bit old fashioned and some may laugh when passing by
i'm not ashamed to call her mother my love for her i'll not deny
she was the first to ever love me..."
"you tell me how she was when you once knew her
she played her games with many, many men
you tell me that you don't think i'd be with her

now that i know her wicked ways
well, i doubt that you could understand my thinking
but listen close to what i have to say
she?s the rock that i lean on
she?s the sunshine of my day
i don't care what you say about her
she took me in and made me everything i am today
she?s my rock and i ain't gonna throw her away

"he stands in the doorway his hands upon his hips
she stands by the plunge board a sweet smile on her lips
he slowly walks up to her she reaches out for him
it's almost like some magnet is pulling both of them
then he says and she says
silent partners they don't say a word she is the adjective and he is the verb
they speak with their bodies and they talk with their eyes
they don't make no promises so they don't tell no lies
silent partners silent partners
later in their love nest at half past ecstasy
they cling to each other and lie there silently
she would like to tell him what she feels in her heart
and he would like to bare his soul but don't know where to start
so he says and she says
silent partners they don't say a word...
they speak with their bodies...
silent partners silent partners silent partners"

in the days that used to be how i wish that you could see
silver dew on the blue grass tonight
star of love high above shining bright
knows the wish that i'm wishing tonight
and you'll bring him back i know to the one that loves him so

""i miss you so much,"" it went on
""and, mom, i didn't know that i loved you so
but i'll prove it when this war is won""

so don't scold if it isn't so neat
for you know as you did, when i was a kid
and would come home with mud on my feet""

and mom we will carry them through
i'll finish this letter the first chance i get

there's a stranger in the house no one will ever see
everybody says he looks like me

she still can't understand him when he says
there's a stranger in the house...
he looks like me"

if you're supposed tonight would be our last together
oh what a long and lonely night it would be

that's all it took to make me yearn to your embrace
i guess i might as well admit no one can take your place
i tell my friends i'm happy but they read me like a book
for when today i heard them say your name that's all it took
for when today i heard them say your name that's all it took"
"yes i'd still love you but i've got doubts about us still i don't know if it's in me to leave you it would be the worst break my heart ever had
we still have something though i feel we'd slipping but i'll try like to devil to save it i'd sure miss that ol' feeling we had
we thought of this love to last
we're falling apart and that's sad
we've got to get it back together we're losing our love
that's good that's bad
we could go to the bedroom it's been too long since we've been there we might break down this wall that's between us
and bring back the good love we had
we thought of this love to last..."

"im just a singer a natural born guitar ringer kind of a clinger to sad old songs
im not a walk behinder im a new note finder
but my name's a reminder of a blues man that's already gone
so i started drinkin' took some things that messed up my thinkin'
i was sure sinkin' when she came along
i was alone in the spot light not too much left in sight
she changed all that one night when she sang me this song
hey baby i love you hey baby i need you
hey baby you don't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho of man
you've wasted so much of your life runnin' through the dark nights
let me shine a little love light down on you blues man
i got so sick from speedin' all the things they said i was needing iff i was to keep on pleasing all of my fans i got cuffed on dirt roads i got sued over no shows she came and took all that old load down off this blues man and i sang hey baby i love you too hey baby i need you
hey baby i do get tired of this traveling band
i'm up in my years now nights would be cold now
if you hadn't stuck it out with this blues man
i'm up in my years now nights would be so cold now
if she hadn't hung around with this blues man."

" you don't know who i  am
but i know all about  you
i've come to talk to you  tonight
about the things i've seen you  do.
 i've come to set the record  straight
i've come to shine the light on  you
let me introduce my  self
i'm the cold hard  truth.
 there is a woman we both  know
i think you know the one i  mean
she gave her heart and soul to  you
you gave her only broken  dreams
 you say your not the one to  blame
for all the heartaches she's been  though
i say you're nothing but a  liar
and i'm the cold hard  truth.
 all your life that's how it's  been
lookin' out for number  one
takin' more than you  give
movin' on when you're  done.
 with her you could have had it  all
a family and love to  last
if you had any sense at  all
you'de go and beg her to come  back.
 you think that you're a real  man
but you're nothing but a  fool
the way you run away from  love
the way you try to play it  cool
 i'm gonna say this just one  time
time is running out on  you
you best remember me my  friend
i am the cold hard  truth.
you best remember me my  friend"
"intro: g
iã¢â‚¬?ve heard the sound of my dear old mama crying
and the sound of the train that took me off to war
the awful sound of a thousand bombs exploding
and i wondered if i could take it anymore
there were times when they almost drove me crazy
but i did my best and took it like a man
and who would think in my lonely room iã¢â‚¬?d hear it
the one sound in the world my heart canã¢â‚¬?t stand
to hear that sound and to know its really over
through tear stained eyes i watched her walk away
and of earthquakes storms and guns and war
lord nothing has ever hurt me more than that lonely sound
the closing of the door
and of earthquakes storms and guns and war
lord nothing ever hurt me more than that lonely sound"
"he’s living in that big old house that he knows was built by me
he’s playing with the baby that belongs to her and me.
at night he loves a woman that was held by these two hands
he must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man.
my name is in the side wall outside our bedroom door
he can’t help but see what’s too dare in me everywhere he goes.
he gladly walked through heaven to forget what he can’t stand
he must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man.
i don’t mean to haunt him when they turn out the lights
i’m there in the bedroom with both of them each night.
and he wonders if he just loved her
as good as i loved her back then
he must be leaving hell to live
with a ghost of another man."
"step right up, come on in
if you'd like to take the grand tour
of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
i have nothing here to sell you
just some things that i will tell you
some things i know will chill you to the bone
over there sits the chair
where she brang the paper to me
and sit down on my knee and whisper oh i love you
but now she's gone forever
and this old house will never be the same
without the love that we once knew
straight ahead that's the bed
where we lay and love together
and lord knows we had a good thing going here
see her picture on the table
don't it look like she'd be able
just to touch me and say good morning dear
there's her rings all her things
and her clothes are in the closet
just like she left them when she tore my world apart
as you leave you'll see the nursery
oh she left me without mercy
taking nothing but our baby and my heart
step right up, come on in"
"i came home the other night i've been out on a town
i searched talk through the house she was not around
i finally found her note it red this is goodbye to you
and that's the last town i painted and i painted it blue
now that i have lost her i don't want to live
i done all the takin' i didn't want to give
time has come it's plain to see the devil must pay his dues
and that's the last town i painted and i painted it blue
i still go to the tavern that i went to before
i search for the fun i had it's not there anymore
if i could have her back again i know i would be true
cause the last town i painted i painted it blue
now blue is not my favorite color cause it makes me sad
why i asked for all these blues when i'm usin' too much red
i've got a lotta troubles no one to tell it to
cause the last town i painted i painted it blue"

i'm tired of sitting home, sick of being all alone
thought i'd just go for a drive
i was headed downtown, when i did me a turnaround
when i saw the neon sign
happy hour two for one, sounded like a lot of fun
so i stopped and went inside
the next thing that i knew, i was sittin' on a barstool
having the time of my life
well, i had more silver bullets last night
than the lone ranger
i was shootin' 'em down like i didn't have a care
ignoring all the danger
bless my soul this morning i awoke
in the arms of a perfect stranger
i had more silver bullets last night than the lone ranger
did i fail to mention it wasn't my intention
to stay out all night long
i was gonna have a few but one round led to two
next thing i knew i was gone
well here's where i draw a blank, the band was playin' hank
she rode in to save the day
and all i remember were kisses sweet and tender
and hi yo silver away"
"there's a secret behind the smile you see
for this smile is just a part of me
but i know some can't see the signs
that show i'm hurtin' all the time
and the lonely know my secret they know you're on my mind
there's a secret behind the lies you tell
for inside is where the sorrow lies
cause i'm living like the lonely do
for they've lost someone they love too
and the lonely know my secret they know what i go through
there's a secret behind the smile you see...
yes the lonely know my secret they know i still love you"
"if you see a man in clothes that's old and ragged
and he walks from bar to bar in worn out shoes
if people point and whisper, ""god have mercy""
would you deny the man that you once knew
if on the street i meet you with your new love
and i walk right up and say, ""how do you do""
would you turn your back and tell him you don't know me
would you deny the love that you once knew
would you be ashamed to remember
i'm the same man who lost ev'rything for you
if tomorrow on the street i die a beggar
would you deny the man that you once knew
would you deny the love that you once knew"

i stopped off at the quicksack for some beer and cigarettes
this old man took my money as he stared at my corvette
he said, i had one just like her son, a 1963
'til the man down at the bank took her from me
i had one that was hotter than a two dollar pistol
she was the fastest thing around
long and lean every young man's dream
she turned every head in town
she was built in from the handles
son, i'm glad that you walked in
she reminds me of the one i loved back then
well i handed him my keys and said, here take her for a spin
the old man scratched his head, then he looked at me and grinned
he said son you just don't understand it ain't the car i want
it's the brunette in your 'vette that turns me on

"i feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
like my heart's sprung a big break
and the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
that i may never shake.
you might say i was taking it hard
oh, she wrote me off with a call
but don't you wager that i'll hide the sorrow
when i may break right down and bawl.
well, the race is on
and here comes pride up the backstretch
heartaches a going to the inside
my tears are holding back
and tryin' not to fall
my heart's out of the running
true love's scratched for another's sake
the race is on and it looks like heartaches
and the winner loses all.
one day i ventured in love, never once suspectin'
what the final results would be
how i lived in fear of waking up each mornin'
and finding that you're gone from me
there's aches and pain in my heart
for today was the one that i hated to face
somebody new came up to win her
i came up in second place.
well, the race is on
and here comes pride up the backstretch

"i've  cried a million tears, down through the years. searching  for
that special  one. and the vows i took before, where all forever more,
but no matter how i  tried they came undone.
then the good lord finally gave me the true love of a lady, someone who
believes in me. and she lets me know each day, that love is here to stay. i
finally found someone who'll never leave.

in my heart i hold the sweetest memory
and each time i gaze into your eyes that's heaven
i can see the same sweet girl so dear to me

who've loved and lost their hearts so many times

and the many dreams i had are torn apart

i've never known a day that sunshine wasn't there
i can't begin to tell you the joy you bring to me

what more could there ever be?

it's so strong that it controls us everyday

"i wandered in around midnight
like i've done so many times
she was sittin' at the table
there were no tears in her eyes
it seemed so much unlike her
to be so much at ease
she took a sip of coffee
and softly said to me
""there's the mantle where
we keep our wedding picture
there's the bedroom where
we make both love and war
and there's the ring that keeps
on slipping off your finger
there's no reason we should go on
anymore and there's the door""
so i'm back here on this bar stool,
my whole world gone to hel
behind the bottles there's a mirror
where a fool can see himself
if i was the man i should be
and not the one i am
i would go back there this minute
and beg for one more chance
there's the jukebox
where i wasted all those quarters
oh, there's a lady trying to
get me out on the floor
and there's a chance the one i love
would still forgive me
it's a step that i just never took before
there's the door
there's the door..."
"these hands aren't the hands of a gentleman these hands are calloused and old
these hands raised a family these hands built a home
now these hands raised to praise the lord
these hands won the heart of my loved one and with hers they were never alone
if these hands filled their task then what more could you ask
for these fingers have worked to the bone
now don't try to judge me by what you'd like me be
for my life hasn't been a success
some people have power but still they grieve
while these hands brought me happiness
now i'm tired and i'm old and i haven't much gold
maybe things ain't been all that i planned
lord above hear my plea when it's time to judge me
take a look at these hard working hands take a look at these hard working hands"
"the old man's hair was white and his eyes looked tired
he drank his beer at the table all alone
but he smiled when i spoke to him so i sat down for awhile
i wound up sitting there the whole night long
'cause i could see he had a lifetime on his mind
so i just sat there and listened, i was glad to take the time.
and he said..
i saw jimmy rodgers yodel on the stage
and i saw hank when the walked him to his grave
i saw a country boy from memphis
change the world with rock and roll
and these old eyes have seen it all.
then he said..
i saw friends of mine or foreign soil die proud
i saw things over there, son, that i still can't talk about
i saw a crazy man named hitler and his army rise and fall
yeah, these old eyes have seen it all.
these old eyes have seen it all
now the hands of time are writing on the wall
telling me i won't have long waiting for my jesus to call
these old eyes have seen it all.
i saw sweet mary love me, fifty years
with a trembling hand we wiped away a tear
he said my memories of mary are the sweetest i recall
and these old eyes have seen it all.
these old eyes have seen it all
they saw a man walk on the moon and come back home
i know it won't be long before i hear my jesus call
these old eyes have seen it all..."

there are pictures and some letters tied in blue

her side of the bed was cold
and layin' there beside me was her ring
with a note that she had left for me
layin' where she used to lay her head
and i felt the world fall in on me
for this is what she said
tied to a stone ain't no way to live
i can't go on livin' like this
i'd rather be lonely and face life alone
than to go on this way, day after day
tied to a stone
i always thought i gave her
everything that any girl could want
the diamonds on her fingers
a new car and a big two story home
home became a prison
and lookin' back now i can see it all
oh, i'd give the world if i could change the things
that made her climb that wall"

i won't believe a word, they say about you
send me a paper have it notarized, too
that still won't mean a thing, till i hear it from you.
draw up a picture, might as well paint it blue
that's how i know i'll feel, if i find hope that's true
write me a letter, address it afool
i won't believe it then, till i hear it from you.
they like me in pittsburgh, everywhere i go
the sudden conversation, he'll be the last to know
put it in the papers, make it headline news
i won't believe it then, till i hear it from you.
i won't believe it then, till i hear it from you..."

the dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again
yes time changes everything
the time has passed i forgot you mother nature does wonderful things
i guess that it's true for me and for you cause time changes everything
oh you change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing
i thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything
so goodluck to you may god bless you i can't say that we won't love again
you have gone your way and i'll go mine cause time changes everything"

you sealed it with a time lock to be locked eternally
you thought it's locked forever and i could never love anew
but today must be forever cause the light is shining through
and now the time lock has opened up the door to my heart
the seal you thought was so secure has shattered all apart
my heart has struck the lock and kept this hurt lock before you
and now somebody else is broken the time lock falling through
when you sealed the time lock you locked my heart up tight
inside the heart it's cold and dark without a sparkling light
another's love was strong enough to break the seal in two
this new love i feel is true and real at last i'm free from you
and now the time lock has opened..."
"don't the sun feel warm today don't our lives feel warm today
we have true love to be proud of
and we both understand it all and neither one demands it all
cause we know how it feels to live on love
don't the birds sing a lovely song don't our hearts sing a lovely song
there's only the good things to be thinking of
there's no trouble to be found strong enough to turn our world around
cause we know how it feels to live on love
yes we know how it feels just to wake up in the morning and be together every day
and to know we've been as close as two hearts could ever be
and there's more love on its way till it come to stay
don't the wind feel good today and don't our smile look good on our face

and i'm right back where i've really always been
i got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend

well i should have known the worst was yet to come
and that crying time for me had just begun

he watches football but she won't

together alone together alone
they're at the house and they're not at home
together alone
no angry words that they'll regret
they're never fuss or fighting yet
sleep side by side but seldom get all together
they wanna plod outside of time
with them the maples gathered round
someday they'll lie beneath the ground there together
together alone together alone
they're not unlike so many i've known
together alone together alone together alone"

that tomorrow we'll be married but tomorrow it is never there

a frosty mug of a cool one helps to beat the heat

well that baseball game on tv takes me back to when i was a kid
we proudly wore those uniforms just like the dodgers did
yeah we won a few and lost a few and for me it still goes on
it's too hot to fish too hot for golf and too cold at home
well i only planned on one or two i might stay for three

like the treasure of true love a love that won't die
so why should i worry what tomorrow will bring
for the treasure of love the treasure of love makes me a king

and if the blues don't leave me i'm gonna rock away from here
trouble in mind i'm blue my old heart is a beating slow
i never had so much trouble in my life before
my good gal she done quit me and it sure did dread my mind

"we always wanted a big two story house
back when we lived in that little two room shack
we wanted fame and fortune
and we'd live life the way the rich folks do
we knew some how we'd make it, together me and you
with dreams and hopes of things to come
we worked and never stopped
not much time for you and me
we had to reach the top
we bought that big two story house
and soon became the envy of the town
with all our work behind us
we'd finally settled down
now we live  in a two story house
whoa, what splendor
but there's no love about
i've got my story
and i've got mine, too
how sad it is, we now live, in a two story house
the house is filled with rare antiques
there's marble on the floor
beauty all around us
like we've never seen before
there's chandeliers in every room
imported silks and satin all about
we filled the house with everything
but somehow left love out
now we live  in a two story house
oh what splendor
but there's no love about
i've got my story
and i've got mine, too
how sad it is, we now live, in a two story house"
"i know i was a fool to let you go
i know it's true because my heart tells me it's so
my only chance at happiness is someday when
i'll win you back but i'll be blue until then
you mean the world to me my life my destiny
your true love means everything to me
i try to lose the thought of loving you again
but memories are just a story with an end
for you the flame of love will burn till someday when
i'll win you back but i'll be blue until then
i try to lose the thought of loving you again..."
"sorry i’m so late
but i’ve been out a walkin’
tryin’ to find a way to tell you

i never want to hurt you
‘cause darlin’ i still love you
but things aren’t like they used to be
it’s time for lettin’ go
i wasn’t out there lookin’
but a month ago last sunday
i met someone just like you
in line at the grocery store
we’ve been spendin’ time together
yea, she knows all about you
the truth is
she can give me
what you can’t anymore
i know i promised you forever
i never thought i’d see this day
if only i could write the pages
our story wouldn’t end this way
i feel so much better
knowing we could have this moment
but it looks like
it’s may rain soon
and it’s getting’ kinda late
hon’ i’ll always bring you roses
every time i come to visit
the caretaker’s waiting
they want to close the cave
i know i promised you forever
i never thought i’d see this day
if only i could write the pages
our story wouldn’t end this way
it wouldn’t end this way"
"wait a little longer please jesus there are so many still wandering out in sin
just a little longer please jesus a few more days to get our loved ones in
here the labor is so hard and the workers are so tired
and their weary hearts are yearning for a rest
and they find they're getting anxious to be in that happy land
where they'll receive such peace and happiness
wait a little longer please jesus...
we look into the skies and tears will fill our eyes
and our weary hearts grow heavier with each day
we cry oh lord please come, come and take your children home
but then we look around us and we say
wait a little longer please jesus..."

"written by b. bouton, f. dycus & b. yates
i once stood in the darkness i couldn't see a light
backed up against the wall i built around my life
i'd run out of reasons to ever love again
but somehow you found a door and you came waltzing in
walls can fall, storms can end
skys can clear, hearts can mend
all it took was your sweet love to rise above it all
you can build 'em strong and tall, but walls can fall
here we stand together with stones enough to build
a bridge into forever beyond the highest hill
the past will fade behind us if we let the future shine
not a thing can come between us if we always keep in mind that"
"the waltz of the angels i hear each time
i hold you tightly in these arms of mine
it's surely from heaven this music i hear
when your lips say i love you in waltz time my dear
there must be a power much higher than i
a writer of love songs way up in the sky
the maker of roses of love sweet and true
and the waltz of the angels he wrote just for you
there must be a power...
oh hurry my darling to my waiting arms
i'll love you forever and keep you from harm
they say love is endless our hearts have been kissed
by the waltz of the angels and far beyond this"
"put a nickel in the jukebox and let it play for my heart is cold with pain
take the cork from the bottle of the warm red wine and fill my glass up again
fill my glass to the brim till it flows o'er the rim
like the tears flow in this heart of mine
then i'll say so long to the dreams that are gone on account of the warm red wine
oh the prison of stone with its cold iron bars is no more than a prison than mine
i'm a prisoner of drink who will never escape from the chains of the warm red wine
oh the wine is red so warm and red like the ruby its sparkles and glows
but i fade for the wine yeah that warm red wine
with all of my hopes and my dreams"
"the wasted words about an old love affair
you don't love me you don't care
i tried so hard to forget the thing that used to be
bit it's so easy to remember a few old memories
just when i think i'm doing fine someone speaks your name
and i have to talk about though i know it's all in vain

to tie it down's a price you'd never pay
and i'll admit there's times when you got restless

hand in hand love grew more everyday
when trouble came we held on to each other
and in each other's arms we loved it away"

i knew someday that you would wed another but wedding bells will never ring"

""there is a fountain"", was her favorite one
and i've seen tears run down the cheeks of sinners
by the time my mama's song was done.
when mama sang the angels stopped to listen
you could see the love light shinin' in her face
when mama sang the angels stopped to listen
now in heaven' choir she had a special places.
you know my daddy wanted me to sing a song
the day that mama left us
and you know that little church

and when she found out someone cared it changed her ways in her mind

little things like this just make things that much worse

"with dolly parton and emmylou harris and trisha yearwood ]
the dirt was clay and was color of the blood in me
a twelve acre farm on a ridge in south tennessee
we left our sweat all over that land behind a mule we watched grow old
row after row
tryin' to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
there was one old store in the holler we all called town
it belonged to a gentle old man named henry brown
he gave us credit in the winter time o we could live through the cold
when the winds brought snow
tryin' to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
oh the one i loved walked through those fields with me
she was a hard workin' woman true as one could be
oh but then one year death was goin' round and swiftly took it's toll
janie had to go
now she lies asleep under ground so poor that grass won't grow
as i stand here looking over this part of tennessee
the fields are bare as far as the eye can see

to tear your heart out when they sing
imagine life without them
all your, radio heros

no, there will never be another
red headed stranger
a man in black and folsom prison blues
the okie from muskogee
or hello darling
lord i wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes
who's gonna fill their shoes
who's gonna stand that tall
who's gonna play the opry

who's gonna give their heart and soul
to get to me and you
lord i wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes
god bless the boys from memphis
blue suede shoes and elvis

they tore up the fifties

this is true for i've been watching from the window up above
you must have thought that i was sleeping and i wish that i had been
but it's best to get to know you and the way your heart can sin
i thought we belonged together and our hearts fit like a glove
but i was wrong for i've been watching from the window up above
from my eyes the teardrops started as i listened on and on
heard you whisper to him softly that our marriage was all wrong
but i hope he makes you happy and you will never lose his love
i lost my mind while i was watching from the window up above
now i wished i could be dreaming and wake up to a love that's true

and on my own i could always find your will to stand
but my weakness and your power made me play too rough

for the first time in my life i'm really proud of me
and without you i can't be the way i wanna be
you you changed and rearranged my life too much
i don't love you anymore i had enough
i'm so proud to know i finally got control of me

she asked if i had quit drinkin'
like i promised her long ago
the words wouldn't come
when i called and she answered
oh, but i found a way to say no
i sent her some wine colored roses
the color of grapes on the vine
when she sees the wine colored roses
they'll tell her i'm still on the wine
the roses will say i still love her
and the color will cause her to cry
one dozen reasons to tell her i'm sorry
and twelve pretty flowers don't lie"

a sign from above on the wings of a dove
when troubles surround us and evils come
the body grows weak and the spirits grow numb
when these things beset us he doesn't forget us

on the wings of a snow white dove...
when noah has drifted in the flood many days
he searched for land in various ways
troubles he had some but wasn't forgotten

he lost all his will to live
and he had no use for pride.
not even all his children's love

now after you've gone all alone i've pined for all that i've got was a worried mind
i gave you a ring i gave you a home you promised me love that you'd never wrong
i bought you fine clothes and i bought you wine but all that i got was a worried mind

and it gets a little tighter every day
it would break my heart to think that i would lose her
so i’ll do anything i can to make her stay
if she could understand how much i need her
then i know that she would never go away
for she’s got me wrapped around her little finger
and it gets a little tighter every day
let me tell you just how much i love my baby
take the world and everything one may desire
for there’s only room in my heart for this lady
who keeps the burning in my heart as hot as fire
she’s the one who’s always lying here beside me
but her mother’s never very far away
yes she’s got me wrapped around her little finger
and it gets a little tighter every day
she pulls the string a little tighter every day."

as i packed up the last few years
and said i'm tired of being so tied down
i'm sure the kids will understand
that daddy's making other plans
i grabbed my bags and i was free and bound
and then i saw the writing on the wall
it said we love you daddy most of all
there in purple crayons scrabbled knee high in the hall
i saw the writing on the wall
in the new world of being free
their mem'ries starting haunting me
i headed home as fast as i could
i still picked the same old door
but no one live there anymore
and that tender message made my teardrops flow
and then i saw the writing on the wall...
i saw the writing on the wall"

you're the best living that i have ever done
a world of loving pleasures that's what one might become
loving you is living my life has just begun
you're the best living that i have ever done
yes you're the best living that i have ever done"
"it wasn't long ago when i first met you
but it didn't take me long to want you near
and the short time that i known you i grown to love you
and i can't stand the thought that you're not here.
why, oh why why, did you do it
you made me become someone which i'm shamed
why, oh why, why did you do it
why you've become my everything.
the beginning of each day i'm a new man but by noon
i begin to feel the fall
and by night i know i just got to have you
and i know that i must answer to your call.
why, oh why why, did you do it
you made me become someone which i'm shamed
why, oh why, why did you do it
why you've become my everything..."
"if the one you'd think is true ever turns his back on you
baby you've still got a place in my heart
if the years should make you cry darling give me one more try
for you've still got a place in my heart
if i'm a fool to pray that you'll come back some day
then i'll know of million fools that love has made that way
so darling don't forget i've been your fool since we first met
and since you've still got a place in my heart
so darling don't forget i've been your fool since we first met
baby you've still got a place in my heart
darlin' you've still got a place in my heart"
"your cheatin' heart
will make you weep
you'll cry and cry
and try to sleep.
but sleep won't come
the whole night through
your cheatin' heart
will tell on you.
when tears come down
like fallin' rain
you'll toss around
and call my name.
you'll walk the floor
the way i do
your cheatin' heart
will tell on you.
    instrumental    
your cheatin' heart
will pine someday
and crave the love
you threw away.
the time will come
when you'll be blue
your cheatin' heart
will tell on you.
when tears come down
like fallin' rain
you'll toss around
and call my name.
you'll walk the floor
the way i do
your cheatin' heart
is gonna tell on you..."
"chorus:
your heart turned left and i was on the right
you couldn't have hurt me more with dynamite
thought i was your destiny, but just before you got to me
your heart turned left and i was on the right.
i almost had the battle won, what could i have said and done
that put you in another's arms tonight?
i don't know where i lost out, i just know without a doubt,
your heart turned left and i was on the right.
chorus:
your heart turned left and i was on the right
you couldn't have hurt me more with dynamite
thought i was your destiny, but just before you got to me
your heart turned left and i was on the right.
    instrumental    
now my poor heart just moans and groans,
i walked around just kicking stones
oh, cupid sure won't get another bite
honey, why'd you lead me on
without a warning you were gone.
your heart turned left and i was on the right.
chorus:
your heart turned left and i was on the right
you couldn't have hurt me more with dynamite
thought i was your destiny, but just before you got to me
your heart turned left and i was on the right.
yeah, your heart turned left and i was on the right.
your heart turned left and i was on the right.
yourheart turned left and i was on the right..."
"your lying blue eyes used to charm me hypnotize me through and through
like a fool lord i've been dreaming your lying blue eyes just told on you
your lying blue eyes used to charm me...
all those stories i've been hearing i wouldn't believe that they were true
but just this morning over coffee your lying blue eyes just told on you
for a long time i have loved you and i've thought you loved me too
now all questions have been answered your lying blue eyes just told on you
your lying blue eyes used to charm me...
your lying blue eyes just told on you"
"written by jim eanes & wade perry
a shoulder to cry on is all you want from me
someone to share your heartaches when you cry
someone you can depend on, who will always be around
i'm nothing more than just your old standby
if you could call me darlin, if you could call me dear
if you could learn to love me by and by
i wouldn't mind this waiting, for i could stand the pain
i'd be more to you than just your old standby
you wouldn't call me darlin and you wouldn't call me dear
i wonder if you'll miss me when i die
you have no consideration, you show no sympathy
i'm nothing more than just your old standby"
