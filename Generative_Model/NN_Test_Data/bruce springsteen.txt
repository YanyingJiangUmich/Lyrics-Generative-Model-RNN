"i get up in the evening
and i ain't got nothing to say
i come home in the morning
i go to bed feeling the same way
i ain't nothing but tired
man i'm just tired and bored with myself
hey there baby i could use just a little help
you can't start a fire
you can't start a fire without a spark
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark
message just keeps getting clearer
radio's on and i'm moving 'round the place
i check my look in the mirror
i wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
man i ain't getting nowhere just living
in a dump like this
there's something happening somewhere
baby i just know that there is
you can't start a fire
you can't start a fire without a spark
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark
you sit around getting older
there's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
i'll shake this world off my shoulder
come on baby the laugh's on me
stay on the streets of this town
and they'll be carving you up all right
they say you gotta stay hungry
hey baby i'm just about starving tonight
i'm dying for some action
i'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write
this book
i need a love reaction
come on now baby gimme just one look
you can't start a fire sitting 'round crying
over a broken heart
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark
you can't start a fire worrying about
your little world falling apart
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark
even if we're just dancing in the dark"
"i was bruised and battered
and i couldn't tell what i felt
i was unrecognizable to myself
i saw my reflection in a window
i didn't know my own face oh brother
are you gonna leave me wastin' away
on the streets of philadelphia
i walked the avenue till my legs felt like stone
i heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
at night i could hear the blood in my veins
just as black and whispery as the rain
on the streets of philadelphia
ain't no angel gonna greet me
it's just you and i my friend
my clothes don't fit me no more
i walked a thousand miles
just to slip the skin
the night has fallen, i'm lyin' awake
i can feel myself fadin' away
so receive me brother with your faithless kiss
or will we leave each other alone like this
on the streets of philadelphia?"
"born down in a dead man's town
the first kick i took was when i hit the ground
you end up like a dog that's been beat too much
till you spend half your life just covering up
born in the u.s.a., i was born in the u.s.a.
i was born in the u.s.a., born in the u.s.a.
got in a little hometown jam
so they put a rifle in my hand
sent me off to a foreign land
to go and kill the yellow man
born in the u.s..a....
come back home to the refinery
hiring man said ""son if it was up to me""
went down to see my v.a. man
he said ""son, don't you understand""
i had a brother at khe sahn
fighting off the viet cong
they're still there, he's all gone
he had a woman he loved in saigon
i got a picture of him in her arms now
down in the shadow of the penitentiary
out by the gas fires of the refinery
i'm ten years burning down the road
nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go
born in the u.s.a., i was born in the u.s.a.
born in the u.s.a., i'm a long gone daddy in the u.s.a.
born in the u.s.a., born in the u.s.a.
born in the u.s.a., i'm a cool rocking daddy in the u.s.a."

"in the day we sweat it out on the streets
of a runaway american dream
at night we ride through mansions of glory
in suicide machines
sprung from cages on highway 9
chrome wheeled, fuel injected
and steppin' out over the line
oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
it's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
we gotta get out while we're young
'cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
wendy, let me in, i wanna be your friend
i wanna guard your dreams and visions
just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
and strap your hands 'cross my engines
together we could break this trap
we'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
oh, will you walk with me out on the wire
'cause baby i'm just a scared and lonely rider
but i gotta know how it feels
i wanna know if your love is wild
baby, i wanna know if love is real
beyond the place hemi powered drones
scream down the boulevard
girls comb their hair in rear view mirrors
and the boys try to look so hard
the amusement park rises bold and stark
and kids are huddled on the beach in the mist
i wanna die with you wendy on the streets tonight
in an everlasting kiss
one, two, three, four
highway's jammed with broken heroes
on a last chance power drive
everybody's out on the road tonight but
there's no place left to hide
together wendy we can live with the sadness
i'll love you with all the madness in my soul
oh, someday girl i don't know when
we're gonna get to that place where really wanna go
and we'll walk in the sun
but till then tramps like us, baby we were born to run
tramps like us, baby we were born to run
come on wendy, tramps like us
baby we were born to run
whoa, ooh
oh, oh, oh, oh
whoa, whoa, whoa
ooh

"she'll let you in her house
if you come knockin' late at night
she'll let you in her mouth
if the words you say are right
if you pay the price
she'll let you deep inside
but there's a secret garden she hides
she'll let you in her car
to go drivin' 'round
she'll let you into the parts of herself
that'll bring you down
she'll let you in her heart
if you got a hammer and a vise
but into her secret garden, don't think twice
you've gone a million miles
how far'd you get
to that place where you can't remember
and you can't forget
she'll lead you down a path
there'll be tenderness in the air
she'll let you come just far enough
so you know she's really there
she'll look at you and smile
and her eyes will say
she's got a secret garden
where everything you want
where everything you need
will always stay
a million miles away"

i'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
gonna chase the clouds away
waitin' on a sunny day
without you i'm workin' with the rain fallin' down
half a party in a one dog town
i need you to chase the blues away
without you i'm a drummer girl that can't keep a beat
and ice cream truck on a deserted street
i hope that you're coming to stay
i'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
gonna chase the clouds away
waitin' on a sunny day
hard times baby, well they come to tell us all
sure as the tickin' of the clock on the wall
sure as the turnin' of the night into day
your smile girl, brings the mornin' light to my eyes
lifts away the blues when i rise
i hope that you're comin' to stay"

"men walkin' 'long the railroad tracks
goin' someplace there's no goin' back
highway patrol choppers comin' up over the bridge
hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
shelter line stretchin' 'round the corner
welcome to the new world order
families sleepin' in their cars in the southwest
no home no job no peace no rest
the highway is alive tonight
but nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes
i'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
searchin' for the ghost of tom joad
he pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
waitin' for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
in a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
got a one way ticket to the promised land
you got a hole in your belly and gun in your hand
sleepin' on a pillow of solid rock
bathin' in the city aqueduct
the highway is alive tonight
where it's headed everybody knows
i'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
waitin' on the ghost of tom joad
now tom said ""mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guy
wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
look for me mom i'll be there
wherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand
or a decent job or a helpin' hand
wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free
look in their eyes mom you'll see me.""

"the screendoor slams, mary's dress waves
like a vision she dances across the porch
as the radio plays
roy orbison singin' for the lonely
hey that's me and i want you only
don't turn me home again i just can't face myself alone again
don't run back inside, darlin' you know just what i'm here for
so you're scared and you're thinkin' that maybe we ain't that young anymore
show a little faith, there's magic in the night
you ain't a beauty, but hey, you're all right
oh, and that's all right with me
you can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
waste your summer prayin' in vain for a savior to ride from these streets
well now i'm no hero, that's understood
all the redemption i can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood
with a chance to make it good somehow
hey what else could we do now
except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
well the night's bustin' open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
we got one last chance to make it real
to trade in these wings on some wheels
climb in back heaven's waitin' down on the tracks
oh, oh come take my hand
we're ridin' out tonight to case the promised land
oh, oh thunder road
oh, thunder road
oh, thunder road
lyin' out there like a killer in the sun
hey i know it's late, we can make it if we run
oh, oh thunder road
sit tight, take hold
thunder road
well i got this guitar and i've learned how to make it talk
and my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
from the front porch to my front seat
the door's open but the ride ain't free
and i know you're hungry for words that i ain't spoke
but tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken
there were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
they haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned out chevrolets
they scream your name at night in the streets
your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
and in the lonely cool before dawn
you hear their engines roarin' on
but when you get to the front porch, they're gone
on the wind
so mary climb in
it's a town full of losers
and i'm pullin' outta here to win"
"you meet me in the night
with tears falling down
come let me dry them for you
i wish i could tell a story
chase away all those ghosts
you got inside of you
a story of heroes who fight on at any cost
of a kingdom of love
to be won or lost
we'll fight here together
'til victory is won
come take my hand 'til morning comes
just close your eyes
i'll stand by you always, always, always
i'll stand by you always, always, always
i know that here in the dark
tomorrow can seem so very far away
here the ghosts and the goblins
can rise from your dreams
to steal your heart away
together we'll chase those thieves
that won't leave you alone
out from under the bed
out from over our home
and when the light comes we'll laugh, my love
at the things that the night
had us so frightened of
and until then
i'll stand by you always, always, always
i'll stand by you always, always, always
now i know it can feel like you're slipping away
at night you'll get lost in that deep dark place
we'll let the night come and do what it may
together we'll find the courage, we'll find faith
until you awake
i'll stand by you always, always, always
i'll stand by you always, always, always
i'll stand by you always
i'll stand by you always
i'll stand by you always, always, always
i'll stand by you always, always, always
i'll stand by you always, always, always
i'll stand by you always, always, always"
"it was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well
you could see that pierre did truly love the madamoiselle
and now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell
c'est la vie, say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell
they furnished off an apartment
with a two room roebuck sale
the coolerator was crammed
with tv dinners and ginger ale
but when pierre found work
the little money comin' worked out well
c'est la vie, say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell
they had a hi fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz
but when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell
c'est la vie, say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell
they bought a souped up jitney, 'twas a cherry red '53
they drove it down to orleans
to celebrate the anniversary
it was there that pierre
was married to the lovely madamoiselle
c'est la vie, say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell"
"big black train comin' down the track
blow your whistle long and long
one minute you're here
next minute you're gone
i lay my penny down on the rails
as the summer wind sings its last song
one minute you're here
next minute you're gone
baby baby baby
i'm so alone
baby baby baby
i'm coming home
autumn carnival on the edge of town
we walk down the midway arm in arm
one minute you're here
next minute you're gone
i thought i knew just who i was
and what i'd do but i was wrong
one minute you're here
next minute you're gone
red river running along the edge of town
on the muddy banks
i lay my body down
this body down
footsteps cracklin' on a gravel road
stars vanish in a sky as black as stone
one minute you're here
next minute you're gone
one minute you're here
next minute you're gone
one minute you're here"
"well janey's got a doctor who tears apart her insides
he investigates her and silently bates her sighs
he probes with his fingers
but knows her heart only through his stethoscope
his hands are cold and his body's so old
janey turns him down like dope
janey needs a shooter now
a shooter like me on her side
janey needs a shooter now
a shooter man who knows her style
the way that i know her style
well janey's got a priest
from his marble pulpit he smiles
he provides consolation and he hears her confession
at any time
in the pages of his bible
he holds from what janey hides
and with her doors open wide she begs, ""come inside""
but he's been frozen so long on the outside
janey needs a shooter now
a shooter like me on her side
janey needs a shooter now
a shooter man who knows her style
the way that i know her style
well janey's got a cop who lives 'round the block
and checks on her every night
the skin turn pale as the siren he'd wail outside
when he knew i was inside
janey's small and sometimes he scared her
so i held her real close
she was more saint than a ghost
and told her i so long had been prepared for her
janey needs a shooter now
a shooter like me on her side
janey needs a shooter now
a shooter man who knows her style
janey needs a shooter now
a shooter like me on her side
janey needs a shooter now

"i was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
into the bus stop
to pick up a paper for my old man
i'd sit on his lap in that big old buick and
steer as we drove through town
he'd tousle my hari and say son take a
good look around this is your hometown
this is your hometown
this is your hometown
this is your hometown
in '65 tension was running high, at my high school
there was a lot of fights between the black and white
there was nothing you could do
two cars at light on a saturday night,
in the back seat there wasa gun
words were passed, in a shotgun blast
troubled times had come, to my hometown
my hometown
my hometown
my hometown
now main street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
seems like there ain't nobody
wants to come down here no more
they're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
foreman says these jobs are going boys
and they ain't coming back to your hometown
your hometown
your hometown
your hometown
last night me and kate we laid in bed talking about getting out
packing up our bags and maybe heading south
i'm 35, we got a boy of our own now
last night i sat him up, behind the wheel
and said son take a goold look around,
this is your hometown"

i been watching you awhile
maybe you been watching me too

left somebody's heart in a mess

some girls they want a handsome dan
or some good lookin' joe on their arm
some girls like a sweet talkin' romeo

i learned you get what you can get
so if you're rough enough for love
honey i'm tougher than the rest
the road is dark
and it's a thin thin line
but i want you to know i'll walk it for you any time
maybe your other boyfriends
couldn't pass the test
well if you're rough and ready for love
honey i'm tougher than the rest
well it ain't no secret
i've been around a time or two
well i don't know baby maybe you've been around too

i wrote 'em all out in ink and blood

sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
edgy and dull and cut a six inch valley
through the middle of my soul

and a freight train running through the
middle of my head
only you can cool my desire

badlands, you gotta live it everyday

as the price you've gotta pay
we'll keep pushin' till it's understood

a notion deep inside
that it ain't no sin
to be glad you're alive

i wanna find one place,
i wanna spit in the face of these badlands"
"i'm driving in my car, i turn on the radio
i'm pulling you close, you just say no

`cause when we kiss, fire
late at night i'm takin you home
i say i wanna stay, you say you wanna be alone
you say you don't love me, girl you cant hide your desire
`cause when we kiss, fire
you had a hold on me, right from the start
a grip so tight i couldnt tear it apart
my nerves all jumpin actin like a fool
well your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool
romeo and juliet, samson and delilah

"well papa go to bed now it's getting late
nothing we can say is gonna change anything now
i'll be leaving in the morning from st. mary's gate
we wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow

there's a darkness in this town that's got us too
but they can't touch me now and you can't touch me now
they ain't gonna do to me what i watched them do to you
so say goodbye it's independence day
it's independence day all down the line
just say goodbye it's independence day
it's independence day this time
now i don't know what it always was with us
we chose the words and yeah we drew the lines
there was just no way this house could hold the two of us
i guess that we were just too much of the same kind
well say goodbye it's independence day
all boys must run away come independence day
so say goodbye it's independence day
all men must make their way come independence day
now the rooms are all empty down at frankie's joint
and the highway she's deserted down to breaker's point
there's a lot of people leaving town now
leaving their friends their homes
at night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone
well papa go to bed now it's getting late
nothing we can say can change anything now
because there's just different people coming down here now
and they see things in different ways
and soon everything we've known will just be swept away
so say goodbye it's independence day
papa now i know the things you wanted that you could not say
but won't you just say goodbye it's independence day
i swear i never meant to take those things away"
"i come from down in the valley
where mister, when you're young
they bring you up to do like your daddy done
me and mary we met in high school
when she was just seventeen
we'd drive out of this valley
down to where the fields were green
we'd go down to the river
and into the river we'd dive
oh down to the river we'd ride
then i got mary pregnant
and, man, that was all she wrote
and for my 19th birthday
i got a union card and a wedding coat
we went down to the courthouse
and the judge put it all to rest
no wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
no flowers, no wedding dress
that night we went down to the river
and into the river we'd dive
oh down to the river we did ride
i got a job working construction for the johnstown company
but lately there ain't been much work
on account of the economy
now all them things that seemed so important
well mister they vanished right into the air
now i just act like i don't remember
mary acts like she don't care
but i remember us riding in my brother's car
her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
at night on them banks i'd lie awake
and pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
now those memories come back to haunt me
they haunt me like a curse
is a dream a lie if it don't come true
or is it something worse
that sends me down to the river
though i know the river is dry
that sends me down to the river tonight
down to the river
my baby and i
oh down to the river we ride"
"i see you walking, baby, down the street
pushing that baby carriage at your feet
i see the lonely ribbon in your hair
tell me i am the man for whom you put it there
you never smile girl, you never speak
you just walk on by, darlin' week after week
raising two kids alone in this mixed up world
must be a lonely life for a working girl
little girl, i wanna marry you
oh yeah, little girl, i wanna marry you
yes i do
little girl, i wanna marry you
now honey, i don't wanna clip your wings
but a time comes when two people should think of these things
having a home and a family
facing up to their responsibilities
they say in the end true love prevails
but in the end true love can't be no fairytale
to say i'll make your dreams come true would be wrong
but maybe, darlin', i could help them along
my daddy said right before he died
that true, true love was just a lie
he went to his grave a broken heart
an unfulfilled life, makes a man hard
oh, darlin'
there's something happy and there's something sad
'bout wanting somebody, oh so bad,
i wear my love darlin', without shame
i'd be proud if you would wear my name"
"spanish johnny drove in from the underworld last night with bruised arms and broken rhythm and a beat up old buick but dressed just like dynamite,
he tried sellin' his heart to the hard girls over on easy street,
but they said, ""johnny, it falls apart so easy and you know hearts these days are cheap.""
and the pimps swung their axes and said, ""johnny, you're a cheater.""
well, the pimps swung their axes and said, ""johnny, you're a liar.""
and from out of the shadows cam e a young girl's voice, said: ""johnny don't cry.""
puerto rican jane, oh won't you tell me what's your name.
i want to drive you down to the other side of town where paradise ain't so crowded and there'll be action goin' down on shanty lane tonight
all the golden heeled fairies in a real b**** fight pull thirty eights and kiss their girls goodnight.
goodnight, it's alright, jane
now let them black boys in to light the soul flame,
we may find it out on the street tonight, baby,
or we may walk until the daylight, maybe.
well, like a cool romeo he made his moves, oh she looked so fine
like a late juliet she knew she'd never be true but then she really didn't mind,
upstairs a band was playin' and the singer was singin' something about going home,
she whispered, ""spanish johnny, you can leave me tonight, but just don't leave me alone.""
and johnny cried, ""puerto rican jane, word is down the cops have found the vein.""
them bare foot boys left their homes for the woods
them little barefoot street boys, they said their homes ain't no good,
they left the corners, threw away their switchblade knives and kissed each other goodbye.
johnny was sittin' on the fire escape watchin' the kids playin' down the
street,
he called down, ""hey little heroes, summer's long but i guess it ain't very sweet around here anymore,
janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat, johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on,
and the sister prays for lost souls then breaks down in the chapel after everyone's gone.
jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see johnny up and putting his clothes on,
she says, ""those romantic young boys, all they ever want to do is fight,
those romantic young boys, they're callin' through the window:
hey, spanish johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?""
and johnny whispered, ""goodnight, it's all tight jane,
i'll meet you tomorrow night on lover's lane
we may find it out on the street tonight now baby
or we may walk until the daylight, baby.""
goodnight, it's alright jane, i'm gonna meet you tomorrow night on lover's lane,
we can find it out on the street tonight, baby,
or we may walk until it's daylight, maybe."
"we fell in love and i made you the world
i spent all my time tryin' to satisfy you, girl
just one thing that i can't figure out closer i get, farther baby i am out 
30 days, 30 days out
well i'm six days runnin' but i'm 30 days out
30 days, 30 days out
with every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt
the roof was leakin' honey where we live
and i'm wonderin' what's that something that you won't give
i started loving you but i gotta stop
you got me mostly waitin' for that other shoe to drop
30 days, 30 days out
you keep me six days runnin' but i'm 30 days out
30 days, 30 days out
with every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt
tried to talk about what's goin' on
you just smile and tell me ""baby there ain't nothin' wrong""
in your smile there's a sign in red
it said ""thousand miles of hard road dead ahead""
30 days, 30 days out
yeah i'm six days runnin' but i'm 30 days out
30 days, 30 days out
with every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt
30 days, 30 days out
well i'm six days runnin' but i'm 30 days out
30 days, 30 days out
with every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt"
"sandy the fireworks are hailin' over little eden tonight
forcin' a light into all those stoned out faces left stranded
on this fourth of july
down in town the circuit's full with switchblade lovers so fast
so shiny so sharp
and the wizards play down on pinball way on the boardwalk way past dark
and the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like latin
lovers along the shore
chasin' all them silly new york girls
sandy the aurora is risin' behind us, the pier lights our carnival
life forever
love me tonight for i may never see you again, hey sandy girl
now the greasers they tramp the streets or get busted for trying to
sleep on the beach all night
them boys in their spiked high heels ah sandy their skins are so white
and me i just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades bangin' them
pleasure machines
chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they promise
to unsnap their jeans
and you know that tilt a whirl down on the south beach drag
i got on it last night and my shirt got caught
and that joey kept me spinnin' i didn't think i'd ever get off
oh sandy the aurora is risin' behind us
the pier lights our carnival life on the water
runnin' down the beach at night with my boss's daughter
well he ain't my boss no more sandy
sandy the angels have lost their desire for us
i spoke to `em just last night and they said they won't set
themselves on fire for us anymore
every summer when the weather gets hot they ride that road down from
heaven on their harleys they come and they go
and you can see `em dressed like stars in all the cheap little seashore
bars parked making love with their babies out on the kokomo
well the cops finally busted madame marie for tellin' fortunes better
than they do
this boardwalk life for me is through
you know you ought to quit this scene too
sandy the aurora's rising behind us, the pier lights our
carnival life forever
oh love me tonight and i promise i'll love you forever"
"i bought a bourgeois house in the hollywood hills
with a truckload of hundred thousand dollar bills
man came by to hook up my cable tv
we settled in for the night my baby and me
we switched 'round and 'round 'til half past dawn
there was fifty seven channels and nothin' on
well now home entertainment was my baby's wish
so i hopped into town for a satellite dish
i tied it to the top of my japanese car
i came home and i pointed it out into the stars
a message came back from the great beyond
there's fifty seven channels and nothin' on
well we might'a made some friends with some billionaires
we might'a got all nice and friendly if we'd made it upstairs
all i got was a note that said ""bye bye john
our love is fifty seven channels and nothin' on""
so i bought a .44 magnum it was solid steel cast
and in the blessed name of elvis well i just let it blast
'til my tv lay in pieces there at my feet
and they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace
judge said ""what you got in your defense son?""
""fifty seven channels and nothin' on""
i can see by your eyes friend you're just about gone
fifty seven channels and nothin' on..."
"it's cloudy out in pittsburgh
it's rainin' in saigon
snow's fallin' all across the michigan line
well she sits by the light of her christmas tree
with the radio softly on
thinkin' how a good man is so hard to find
well once she had a fella
once she was somebody's girl
and she gave all she had that one last time
now there's a little girl asleep in the back room
she's gonna have to tell about the meanness in this world
and how a good man is so hard to find
well there's pictures on the table by her bed
him in his dress greens and her in her wedding white
she remembers how the world was the day he left
and now how that world is dead
and a good man is so hard to find
she got no time now for casanovas
yeah those days are gone
she don't want that anymore, she's made up her mind
just somebody to hold her
as the night gets on
when a good man is so hard to find
well she shuts off the tv
and without a word
into bed she climbs
well she thinks how it was all so wasted
and how expendable their dreams all were

"tonight my bag is packed
tomorrow i'll walk these tracks
that will lead me across the border
tomorrow my love and i will sleep 'neath auburn skies
somewhere across the border
we'll leave behind my dear
the pain and sadness we found here
and we'll drink from the bravo's muddy water
where the sky grows grey and wide
we'll meet on the other side
there across the border
for you i'll build a house
high upon a grassy hill
somewhere across the border
where pain and memory
pain and memory have been stilled
there across the border
and sweet blossoms fill the air
pastures of gold and green
roll down into cool clear waters
and in your arms 'neath open skies
i'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes
there across the border
tonight we'll sing the songs
i'll dream of you my coraz_n
and tomorrow my heart will be strong
and may the saints' blessing and grace
carry me safely into your arms
there across the border
for what are we
without hope in our hearts
that someday we'll drink from god's blessed waters
and eat the fruit from the vine
i know love and fortune will be mine
somewhere across the border"
"well don't move
why don't you listen to what i'm saying
and hey you

at school

"in the summer that i was baptized my father held me to his side
as they put me to the water he said how on that day i cried
we were prisoners of love a love in chains
he was standin' in the door i was standin' in the rain
with the same hot blood burning in our veins
adam raised a cain
all of the old faces ask you why you're back
they fit you with position and the keys to your daddy's cadillac
in the darkness of your room your mother calls you by your true name
you remember the faces the places the names
you know it's never over it's relentless as the rain
adam raised a cain
in the bible cain slew abel and east of eden he was cast
you're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past
daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain
now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame
you inherit the sins you inherit the flames
adam raised a cain
lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream
adam raised a cain"
"an echo fades of sounds once heard
by thousands brought together for
his ringing voice, a soul that stirred
the faithful to a mighty roar.
for twenty years upon the stage
for twenty years upon the stage
the passion deep within his soul
brought forth the anger and the rage
his vision locked upon one goal.
the promises of rock and roll could
break the chains upon his life,
guitar in hand he vowed he would
be free from pain and inner strife.
he shook the rafters in the halls
and brought the faithful to their feet,
his river coursed through mighty walls
across this land, down every street.
with flag unfurled he took the word
across the seas to hungry youth
who raised their hands when e'er they heard
his cries for faith, and hope, and truth.
today he stands with inner peace
a man content with home and health,
upon his brow a jagged crease
a symbol of success and wealth.
the thunder of his younger days
has passed, and now his words reveal
a calmer soul in many ways
fulfilled with satisfactions real.
his arms upraised against the light
he stands alone, his eyes look toward
the ground below, a bird in flight
still searching for his true reward.
his mission done, he finds retreat
with children and a loving wife,
his body tired from the heat
the price he pays for touring life.
but deep within the longings stir
the music runs within him still,
his passions for the times that were
are stronger than his iron will.
and all of us who know the man
will come together when he cries
the message we all understand
the thunder in us never dies."
"well you don't like, don't like the way i walk

we're in the high grass, my finger in your hemline
boot heels click clacking, honey, when you shine
all them blue skies
american beauty wherever you'd sigh

your hand cups your breast pledging your time
the things we carried, shining skylines
falling sparrow, sky torn apart
dark shining arrow, your kiss pierces my heart
american beauty forever mine

they died in the fields and factories, names scattered in the wind
they died to get here a hundred years ago, they're dyin' now
the hands that built the country we're all trying to keep down
there's diamonds in the sidewalk, there's gutters lined in song
dear i hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
there's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
who will make his home in the american land
who will make his home in the american land
who will make his home in the american land"

"the moon hung like a shadow on a rung over shangai
them soldier boys were returning home screaming ""banzai""
and the kids are still playing their games
gettin hustled and rustled out in the rain
as i sat inside listening to the broadcast
oh save my soul sweet rock'n'roll 'cause i'm sinkin' fast
and then the band played
out of nowhere, it was alright
well now the legendary chaplain of the fightin' 51st was gettin' ready to go
i said: padre, do you know a cheap virgin who like to tango?
he said: you can try linda lee,
around the corner and across the sea
oh word is out word is out she's fast
oh blow me down linda 'cause i'm sinkin' fast
yes and them cats are sure getting fat
down in the train yard
and the sandman brings them dreams
to ship out in boxcars
the union says hold, break out the dice, break out the gold
it's lunchtime at last
and old big mama said: ""georges raft's tonight on the late show""
she sits straddlin' a kitchen chair, really gung ho
she shivers with chills, wet with her slot card thrills
hypnotically lost in the glass
and we all sigh with the sunrise
as we watch the credits pass
and the little blue dot went away
and then the morning cloak fell down
like a hoax over sleepytown
them garbage truck vigilantes out making their last rounds
the inheritor he sipped his beer
and poked fun at the queer
and threatened to kick his ass
and the bell rings, a horn blows
and he's outside pumpin' gas
but the things were movin' so slow tonight
so the kid goes back inside the station
and turns on his radio to his local am station
and then the band played
right on the radio, it was alright
and the boys in the band sung
and the band played, everybody"
"he was a bouncer in a joint called tony's body shop
she was a night cashier down at the stop 'n' shop
he was kinda good lookin'
and she was kinda fun
they met 'neath that big oak tree
out where the river runs
little angelyne, little angelyne
as the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
just big bill and little angelyne
she was just in from texas, didn't know her way around
so he took her to a roadhouse on the edge of town
in the beerhall light she looked so fine
and so he popped the question that was on his mind
it was a simple affair, only a friend or two
preacher asked if they did, they said they do
she bought two tickets with her daddy's american express
and hopped a greyhound bus in her wedding dress
little angelyne, little angelyne
as the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
just big bill and little angelyne
in a six dollar motel with the honey bun
with seven glorious days in the nevada sun
he played the tables, she pumped the slots full of dimes
they came back broke but they had a good time
now many fell apart in the years come and gone
but big bill and little angel they'd last on and on
they held together when the times grew thin
a little boy that looked like her, and a girl that looked like him
so mister don't you pay it no mind
let the sun go down and the moonlight shine
back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
just big bill and little angelyne
little angelyne, little angelyne
as the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
just big bill and little angelyne
little angelyne, little angelyne
as the sun goes down and the moonlight shines
back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
just big bill and little angelyne"
"shrieks of sheiks as they run across the movie screen
a thousand sand dune soldiers led by an arabian queen
and the harem girls move like fancy  dancers
in my dirty dreams
and i wake up on the floor clutching the bed lamp
and mama comes in, she screams
""hey you been out with that tramp again last night
you know that silver sequined arab black b****
the one that mama don't like ?""
but mama she sings me moontime melodies
with this great top 40 hook
she shrugs her shoulders, she don't care
papa just stares and says ""mary, look the girl's alright
the girl's alright""
and there's a tenseness in the air he turns and says
don't you know, can't you feel it ""tell me son, what's the word ?""
because there's something hanging there 'cos you know he can't hear it
pull back the mist and reveal it but don't go near it
and even if you fear what you near it's criticized as too absurd
don't conceal it even the animals fear it
'cos if what mama feels is too real papa says ""fetch me my flashlight,
son""
she just claims she don't feel it and she stumbles out the front door
so come out from behind your bunkers
'cos the lift off's been a bust
oh papa's gone and mama's dead
and buried in my rocket dust
you're alone now for the first time
don't worry, 'cos that's all right
all fear will completely disappear
come the arabian night
well the soundman smiles and turns the dials
to set the meter readin' rising
he pulls the singer's voice from out of his pocket
to see if the audience likes it
oh and in the very first row sits sweet jenny rue
with a bell on her shoe and she wants him to make it
he flicks a switch but jenny moves too fast
and the audience sways to the sound of her shotgun blast
the manager comes running out from behind stage and says
check the band's arms for bullet holes
make that man roll up his sleeves""
the drummer shoots himself with cyanide
and then asks to be relieved
and me, i say ""well, it's too crazy in here
which is the stage door out, i gotta get up tomorrow morning for work""
and the promoter says ""man, once you're in they all lead out
what's the matter man, ain't you heard ?
there's a war going on on the outside
and i'm paying you to sing like a bird
so get in and get tough or get up and get out
because things aren't too tight""
i said ""don't worry, man, everything's gonna loosen up
come the arabian night""
come the arabian night
so i get back in my bed
but outside my window i hear another gang fight
it's duke and the boys against the devil's best man
and both sides have drawn their knives
and duke he's a well known knife fighter
and with one quick jab he brings the devil down
he smiles 'cos he knows there's a high bounty on devils
in any god fearin' town
well they say duke sold the devil to some priest in pennsylvania
to exhibit on his altar christmas night
but the devil's eyes they still burn red with fire
as long as duke walks upright
and he swears there's a going to be a showdown
come sundown on the arabian night"
"well, they blew up the chicken man in philly last night
now, they blew up his house, too

and the d.a. can't get no relief

oh baby doll
they tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb
but i knew they were wrong
you're just a silent one
oh baby doll
they tried to tell me you could not feel
but i found out they tried to conceal
from you, that you were a woman
well they brought you into their laboratory
and tried to get you to show and tell
they wanted to hear you say that you were sorry
and then they told you that you were conceived in hell
but baby doll, you knew
you knew that wasn't true
you knew that it was them
it wasn't you
oh baby doll
it was so hard to know you
i could not tell, i couldn't show you
but i didn't have to, 'cause you already knew
oh baby doll
they had to see by touching hands
we had to dance to a silent band
and you surprised me, being so graceful
i know you can't hear these songs i sing
but then they're more for me than they are for you
because you don't need these songs, babe, like i do
yeah, you knew the first time that i held you babe
you didn't have to hear how i love
oh baby doll
they tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb

"in my dream our love was lost, i lived by luck and fate
i carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn't be too late
now i'm standin' on this empty road where nothin' moves but the wind
and honey i just wanna be back in your arms
back in your arms again
back in your arms
back in your arms again
once i was your treasure and i saw your face in every star
but the promises we make at night, oh that's all they are
unless we fill them with faith and love they're empty as the howlin' wind
and honey i just wanna be back in your arms
back in your arms again
back in your arms
back in your arms again
back in your arms
back in your arms again
you came to me with love and kindness
but all my life i've been a prisoner of my own blindness
i met you with indifference and i don't know why
now i wake from my dream, i wake from my dream to this world
where all is shadow and darkness andabove me a dark sky unfurls
and all the love i've thrown away and lost i'm longin' for again
now darlin' i just wanna be back in your arms
back in your arms again
back in your arms
back in your arms again
back in your arms
back in your arms again

"one soft infested summer me and terry became friends
trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in
catching rides to the outskirts tying faith between our teeth
sleeping in that old abandoned beach house getting wasted in the heat
and hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
with a love so hard and filled with defeat
running for our lives at night on them backstreets
slow dancing in the dark on the beach at stockton's wing
where desperate lovers park we sat with the last of the duke street kings
huddled in our cars waiting for the bells that ring
in the deep heart of the night to set us loose from everything
to go running on the backstreets, running on the backstreets
we swore we'd live forever on the backstreets we take it together
endless juke joints and valentino drag where dancers scraped the tears
up off the street dressed down in rags running into the darkness
some hurt bad some really dying at night sometimes it seemed
you could hear the whole damn city crying blame it on the lies that killed us
blame it on the truth that ran us down you can blame it all on me terry
it don't matter to me now when the breakdown hit at midnight
there was nothing left to say but i hated him and i hated you when you went
away
laying here in the dark you're like an angel on my chest
just another tramp of hearts crying tears of faithlessness
remember all the movies, terry, we'd go see
trying to learn how to walk like heroes we thought we had to be
and after all this time to find we're just like all the rest
stranded in the park and forced to confess
to hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
we swore forever friends on the backstreets until the end
hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets"
"he lay his blanket underneath the freeway
as the evening sky grew dark
took a sniff of toncho from his cocaine
and headed thru balboa park
where the men in their mercedes
come nightly to employ
in the cool san diego evening
the services of the border boys
he grew up near the zona norte
with the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with
he swallowed their balloons of cocaine
brought them across to the 12th streetstrip
sleepin' in a shelter
if the night got to cold
runnin' from the migra
of the border patrol
past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks
and in thru the storm drain
they stretched their blankets out 'neath the freeway
and each one took a name
there was x man and cochise
little spider his sneakers covered in river mud
they come north to california
end up with the poison in their blood
he did what he had to for the money
sometimes he sent home what he could spare
the rest went to high top sneakers and toncho
and jeans like the gavachos wear
one night the border patrol swept 12th street
a big car came fast down the boulevard
spider stood caught in its headlights
got hit and went down hard
as the car sped away=20
spider held his stomachlimped to his blanket 'neath the freeway
lay there tasting his own blood on his tongue
closed his eyes and listened to he cars
rushin' by so fast"

"father, i have come.

we rolled down into the town
from where the black throats come.
and you know there was a robb'ry.
there was a holdup.
ooh, there was a shootout.
and there was a killin'.
and there's blood on my hands.
today i killed a man.
well now, sister, you know me well.
and you ask me well, how it was i felt.
well, she had an appetite for lovin'
only a fadin' beauty could posses.
she knew just what she wanted
and she wouldn't take less.
i figured it was a small town.
it was at sundown.
it was just a small crowd of people around.
oh! but he wouldn't put his guns down.
no, he wouldn't put his guns down.
oh, he wouldn't put his guns down.
now his blood's on my hands.
today i killed a man.
and, papa, you showed me the beauty of buckshot.
well, that song a bullet sings as she whistles.
and showed me the story of the self loading pistol.
well now, father. i have come.
to tell you about somethin' i done.
he had a widow, runnin' through town screamin'.
he had a brother, and his tears were streamin'.
now i'm movin' on the border

but in the morning you end up with second thoughts that came from your
actions
and another cameo roll with some big player your befriending
your gonna go broken hearted looking for that happy ending
well girl your gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold
crying alone in the theater as the credits roll
you see i won't be like those other guys

yeah there's better days shining through
these are better days baby
better days with a girl like you
well i took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss
it's like eatin' caviar and dirt
it's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending
a rich man in a poor man's shirt
now my ass was draggin' when from a passin' gypsy wagon
your heart like a diamond shone
tonight i'm layin' in your arms carvin' lucky charms
out of these heard luck bones
these are better days baby
these are better days it's true
these are better days
there's better days shining through
now a life of leisure and a pirate's treasure
don't make much for tragedy
but it's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin
and can't stand the company
every fool's got a reason to feelin' sorry for himself
and turn his heart to stone
tonight this fool's halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell
and i feel like i'm comin' home

there's better days shining through
these are better days
better days with a girl like you
these are better days baby
these are better days it's true
these are better days
better days are shining through"

"raney william's playground was among haven's streets
where he ran past melted candles and flower wreaths
names and photos of the young black faces
whose death and blood consecrated these places
raney's mother said raney stay at my side
for you are my blessing, you are my pride
it's your love here that keeps my soul alive
i want you to come home from school and stay inside
raney'd do his work and put his books away
there was a channel showed a western movie everyday
and that brought him home books on the black cowboys of the oklahoma range
the seminole scouts that fought the tribes of the great plains
summer come and the days grew long
raney always had his mother's smile to depend on
along the street of stray bullets he made his way
to the warmth of her arms at the end of each day
come the fall, the rain flooded these homes
in ezekiel's valley of dry bones
it fell hard and dark to the ground
it fell without a sound
and they took up with a man whose business was the boulevard
whose smile was fixed in a face that was never off guard
in the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink his secrets are kept
in the day, behind drawn curtains in the next bedroom he slept
and she got lost in the days
the smile raney depended on dusted away
the arms that held him were no more his own
he lay at night his head pressed to her chest listening to the ghost in her bones
in the kitchen, raney slipped his hand between the pipes
from a brown bag pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side
stood in the dark at his mother's bed
brushed her hair and kissed her eyes
in the twilight raney walked to the station on streets of stone
through pennsylvania and ohio his train drifted on
through the small towns of indiana the big train crept
as he lay his head back on his seat and slept
he woke and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green
corn and cotton and endless nothing in between
over the rutted hills of oklahoma the red sun slipped and was gone
the moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone"

he said take a right at the light, keep going straight until right, and then boy you're on your own
and now in zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune
yes, and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
and some kidnapped handicap was complaining that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
well i unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears i saw a gap but he'd figured he'd be all right
he was just blinded by the light. cut loose like a deuce
another runner in the night. blinded by the light
mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
oh but mama that's where the fun is"
"we played king of the mountain out on the end
the world come chargin' up the hill
and we were women and men
now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away
we got our own roads to ride
and chances we gotta take
we stood side by side each one fightin' for the other
we said until we died we'd always be blood brothers
now the hardness of this world
slowly grinds your dreams away
makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make
and what once seemed black and white
turns to so many shades of gray
we lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay
and it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover
with no one runnin' by your side my blood brother
on through the houses of the dead past
those fallen in their tracks
always movin' ahead and never lookin' back
now i don't know how i feel, i don't know how i feel tonight
if i've fallen 'neath the wheel, if i've lost or i've gained sight
i don't even know why, i don't know why i made this call
or if any of this matters anymore after all
but the stars are burnin' bright like some mystery uncovered
i'll keep movin' through the dark with you in my heart
my blood brother"
"well i came by your house the other day
your mother said you went away
she said there was nothing that i could have done
there was nothing nobody could say
me and you we've known each other
ever since we were sixteen
i wished i would have known
i wished i could have called you
just to say goodbye bobby jean
now you hung with me
when all the others turned away turned up their noise
we liked the same music
we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes
we told each other that we were the wildest
the wildest things we'd ever seen
now i wished you would have told me
i wished i could have talked to you
just to say goodbye bobby jean
now we went walking in the rain
talking about the pain from the world we hid
now there ain't nobody nowhere
nohow gonna ever understand me the way you did
maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere
in some bus or train traveling along
in some motel room there'll be a radio playing
and you'll hear me sing this song
well if you do you'll know
i'm thinking of you and all the miles in between
and i'm just calling one last time not to change your mind
but just to say i miss you baby
good luck goodbye, bobby jean"
"i'm standing in the backyard
listening to the party inside
tonight i'm drinkin' in the forgiveness
this life provides
the scars we carry remain but the pain slips away it seems
oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams
i'm watchin' you through the window
with your girlfriends from back home
you 're showin' off your dress
there's laughter and a toast
from your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen
oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams
in the darkness my fingers slip across your skin
i feel your sweet reply
the room fades away and suddenly i'm way up high
just holdin' you to me
as through the window the moonlight streams
oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams
now the ritual begins
'neath the wedding garland we meet as strangers
the dance floor is alive with beauty
mystery and danger
we dance out 'neath the stars' ancient light into the darkening trees
oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams"
"border guard
bless on the border guard so cold and alone
bless on the child so far from his home
pity the border guard who feels like a woman to cry
pity the border guard whose life guards the line
a light is a funny thing
a border sometime
a light is a hurting thing
use only to divine
i pity the refugee whose home lies behind
i pity the border guard and his border line
he keeps his machine gun nose pointed to the sky
the night time is his master
and you know the dawn light brings his captor
and i pity the border guard as he walks, well as he walks his own
the echo of his foot steps is all a friend would know
a home is a funny thing
you get tied to the earth
like a love is a crazy thing
in the eye of a child
i pity the border guard whose soul taken captive at birth
may the sweet brace of his grief and show him how to be so wild
yes a light is a funny thing
a border sometimes
a light is a hurting thing
used only to divine
he who made the open plains and the world one and all
could not have conceived with a barbed wire brain
for the building of the wall and at night i keep my fire bright
so that i may be safe when i sleep
till i wake on that wonderful morning with no more light well ooh"

as the band plays
what are those words whispered baby
just as you turn away
i saw you last night
out on the edge of town
i wanna read your mind
to know just what i´ve got in
this new thing i´ve found
so tell me what i see
when i look in your eyes
is that you baby
or just a brilliant disguise
i heard somebody call your name
from underneath our willow
i saw something tucked in shame
underneath your pillow
well i´ve tried so hard baby
but i just can´t see
what a woman like you
is doing with me
so tell me who i see
when i look in your eyes
is that you baby
or just a brilliant disguise
now look at me baby
struggling to do everything right
and when it all falls apart
when out go the lights
i´m just a lonely pilgrim
i walk this world in wealth
i wanna know if it´s you i don´t trust
´cause i damn sure don´t trust myself
now you play the loving woman
i´ll play the faithful man
but just don´t look too close
into the palm of my hand
we stood at the altar
the gypsy swore our future was right
but come the wee wee hours
well maybe baby the gypsy lied
so when you look at me
you better look hard and look twice
is that me baby
or just a brilliant disguise

i´m lost in the darkness of our love

who doubts what he´s sure of."

"bill horton was a cautious man of the road
he walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code
when something caught his eye he'd measure his need
and then very carefully he'd proceed
billy met a young girl in the early days of may
it was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away
in their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim
he'd lay back in her arms and laugh what had happened to him
on his right hand billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear
and in which hand he held his fate was never clear
come indian summer he took his young lover for his bride
and with own hands built a great house down by the riverside
now billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right
he worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights
alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray
for he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay
one night billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name
she lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep a thousand miles away
he got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode
when he got there he didn't find nothing but road
billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name
just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain
at their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on her skin so white
filling their room with the beauty of god's fallen light"

rambling through the town

lovers walking through the mist, romeo he steal a kiss
caught up in the moment of chain lightning

but baby it's the latest thing

i lie awake at night and wonder if i'm tough enough
to win back the hand of chevrolet deluxe.
......
they shut the power off down at the mill and these days when you ride down main street
it's just whitewashed windows and vacancy signs
did you ever think til the end your kids you would never believe
that if you would leave this old town, that it would leave me.

"when i was a little kid
i never liked to eat
mom would put things on my plate
and i'd dump 'em on her feet
but then one day she made this soup
i ate it all in bed
i asked her what she put in it
and this is what she said:
""oh, chicken lips and lizard hips
and alligator eyes
monkey legs and buzzard eggs
and salamander thighs
rabbit ears and camel rears
and tasty toenail pies
stir 'em all together
and it's mama's soup surprise""
i went into the bathroom
and i stood beside the sink
i said, ""i'm feeling slightly ill
and i think i'd like a drink""
mama said, ""i've just the thing
i'll get it in a wink
it's full of lots of protein
and vitamins, i think""

"well, far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll
we ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashin'
as majestic bells of boats struck shadows in the sun;
sayin', it may be the chimes of freedom flashin'
flashin' for the warriors whose strength is not to fight;
flashin' for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight.
and for each and every underdog soldier in the night
we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'
well, in the city's melted furnace unexpectedly we watched
with faces hidden here while the walls were tightenin'
as the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain;
dissolved into the wild bales of lightnin'
yeah, tollin' for the rebel, yeah, tollin' for the raked
tollin' for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked.
yeah, tollin' for the outcasts burnin' constantly at stakes
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'
oh yeah! 
and then through a cloud like curtain in a far off corner flashed
there's a hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly liftin'
well, electric light still struck like arrows
fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'
well, tollin' for the searching ones on this speechless, secret trail
for the lonesome haunted lovers with too personal a tale.
and for each young heart for each channeled soul misplaced inside a jail
yeah, we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'
well, starry eyed and laughin' i recall when we were caught,
trapped by an old track of vows for the hands suspended
as we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look
spellbound and swallowed ""has the tollin' ended?""
yeah, tollin' for the achin' ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
for the countless, confused, accused, misused strung out ones at worst.
and for every hung out person in the whole wide universe
we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'
uh uh uh... "

no armies stormed the shores for which we'd die
no dictators were crowned

marauders raided in the dark and
brought death to my hometown
they brought death to my hometown
they destroyed our families' factories
and they took our homes
they left our bodies on the plains,
the vultures picked our bones

for they'll be returning sure as the rising sun
get yourself a song to sing and sing it 'til you're done

the greedy thieves who came around

the worms in the barrel, the hanging sun
those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin

the rush of your lips, the feel of your name
the beat in your heart, the devil's arcade
you said ""heroes are needed, so heroes get made""
somebody made a bet, somebody paid
the cool desert morning and nothing to save
just metal and plastic where your body caved
the slow games of poker with lieutenant ray
in the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name
where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade
you sleep and you dream, your buddies charlie and james
and wake with a thick desert dust on your skin
voice says ""don't worry, i'm here
just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear""
house on a quiet street, a home for the brave
a glorious kingdom with the sun on your face
rising from a long night as dark as the grave
on a thin chain of next moments and something like faith
on a morning to order a breakfast to make
a bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits
for the touch of your fingers, the end of the day
the beat of your heart, the beat of your heart
the beat of your heart, the beat of your heart
the beat of your heart, the beat of her heart
the beat of your heart, the slow burning away
of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade"

girl we're living in a dollhouse
we may feel safe and sound
but our dollhouse, girl, is falling down
everything's as you dreamed it would be
but there's something wrong that you can't see
room by room you keep looking for some little flaw
a crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall
something, girl, that will explain away
the hurt you feel, darling, when we play
your little dolls they got a grip on you
until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too
we're living in a dollhouse
girl, we're living in a dollhouse
oh we're living in a dollhouse
we may feel safe and sound
but our dollhouse, girl, is falling down
oh we're living in a dollhouse
girl, we're living in a dollhouse
yeah we're living in a dollhouse"
"cold rain running down the front of my shirt
i'm flat on my back wheels in the dirt
angel makes her face up out on baker street
she's straddlin; the shifter in my front seat
there's nothing to lose
it's a set up the deck's stacked
so put your foot to the floor
and darling don't look back
well making night tracks through the blazing rain
blow them pistons, work  in the fast lane
white line burning, pockets full of cash
angel writes her name in lipstick on my dash
there's nothing to lose
it's a set up  the deck's stacked tonight we'll blow off the doors and honey we won't look back 
we held it in our hearts in the pouring rain
we made it through the heart of a hurricane
we tore it apart and put it together again
we'll wash out sins, girl down in the sea
angel won't you believe in love for me
we'll move with the city in the dark
you got to walk it talk it in your heart
there's nothin' to lose
it's a set up the deck's stacked
so put your foot to the floor  darling
tonight we'll blow out  the doors darling put your foot to the floor and darling don't look back don't look back
ah, baby, don't look back"
"sun comes every morning, but it ain't no friend
i get dressed and i go back again
the rain keeps on falling on twisted bones and dirt
i'm buried to my heart here in this hurt
the fire keeps on burning, you're waiting in the cold
down in the hole, down in the hole
dark and bloody autumn pierces my heart
the memory of your kiss tears me apart
the sky above is turning, the world below's gone gray
i thought that i could turn and walk away
but the fire keeps on burning, and i'm working in the cold
down in the hole, down in the hole
radio's crackling with the headlines
wind in the phone lines
the sun upon your shoulder
empty city skylines
the day rips apart, a dark and bloody pierced my heart
i got nothing but heart and sky and sunshine
the things you left behind
i wake to find my city's gone to black
days just keep on falling
your voice keeps on calling
i'm going to dig right here until i get you back
the fires keep on burning
i'm here with you in the cold
down in the hole, down in the hole"
"i had a job, i had a girl
i had something going mister in this world
i got laid off down at the lumber yard
our love went bad, times got hard
now i work down at the carwash
where all it ever does is rain
don't you feel like you're a rider on a downbound train
she just said ""joe i gotta go
we had it once we ain't got it any more""
she packed her bags left me behind
she bought a ticket on the central line
nights as i sleep, i hear that whistle whining
feel her kiss in the misty rain
and i feel like i'm a rider on a downbound train
last night i heard your voice
you were crying, crying, you were so alone
you said your love had never died
you were waiting for me at home
put on my jacket, i ran through the woods
i ran till i thought my chest would explode
there in the clearing, beyond the highway
in the moonlight, our wedding house shone
i rushed through the yard, i burst through the front door
my head pounding hard, up the stairs i climbed
the room was dark, our bed was empty
then i heard that long whistle whine
and i dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried
now i swing a sledge hammer on a railroad gang
knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain
now don't it feel like you're a rider on a downbound train"

and to taste your tender charms

don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
just drive fast, fall hard
at nineteen, i was the king of the dirt
down at the remington draw
i liked the pedal and i didn't mind the wall
'midst the roar of the metal i never heard a sound
i was looking for anything
any kind of drug to lift me up off this ground
drive fast, fall hard, i'll keep you in my heart
yeah, don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
just drive fast, fall hard
we met on the set of this b picture that she made
she liked her guys a little greasy and 'neath her pay grade
we headed down to baja in the desert
we made our stand of it
figured maybe together we could get the broken pieces to fit
drive fast, fall hard, keep me in your heart

is dry lightning on the horizon line
just dry lightning and and you on my mind
i chased the heat of her blood
like it was the holy grail
descend beautiful spirit
into the evening pale
her appaloosa's
kickin' in the corral smelling rain
there's a low thunder rolling'cross the mesquite plain
but there's just dry lightning on the horizon line
it's just dry lightning and and you on my mind
i'd drive down to alvarado street
where she'd dance to make ends meet
i'd spend the night over my gin
as she'd talk to her men
well the piss yellow sun
comes bringin' up the day
she said 'ain't nobody can give nobody
what they really need anyway.'
well you get so sick of the fightin'
you lose your fear of the end
but i can't lose your memory
and the sweet smell of your skin

i don't get no sleep
so i turn on the radio
but, lord, the only thing i hear
is you whisperin' in my ear
the words that you used to say
well, now the days grow longer
my love grows stronger
and the fever gets worse every day
i got a fever for a girl

oh, he's got the fever
nothing that a boy can do
when he's got the fever for a girl
he's got the fever
oh, he's got the fever
left this little boy blue
i can remember comin' home
see you standin' at the stove
with the dishes on the table
dinner ready to go
or maybe out to a movie show
something that you'd like to see
oh, you were my sun in the morning
and my moon at night
when you put your arms around me
made me fell alright
well, now the days grow longer
and my love just grows stronger
and the fever gets so bad at night
i got a fever for a girl

if i can make it to the morning
i'm gonna be alright, now
if i can just make it to the morning
it's just this long and lonely nights
everytime i close my eyes
all i see is her face
everytime i shut my eyes
all i see is her face
but i'm gonna be alright, now
i'll be alright, now
when i shut down all the lights
when i turn off all the lights
when i turn down all the lights
and when i lay my head on the pillow
i can't stop myself in thinking
""baby, where are you tonight?""
""where is she tonight?"""

"princess cards she sends me with her regards
barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard
wounded deep in battle, i stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted
to her cheshire smile. i'll stand on file, she's all i ever wanted
but you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts
honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back
you wouldn't even give me time to cover my tracks
you said ""here's your mirror and your ball and jacks""
but they're not what i came for, and i'm sure you see that too
i came for you, for you, i came for you, but you did not need my urgency
i came for you, for you, i came for you, but your life was one long
emergency
and your cloud line urges me, and my electric surges free
crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak
reveal yourself all now to me girl while you've got the strength to speak
`cause they're waiting for you at bellevue with their oxygen masks
but i could give it all to you now if only you could ask
and don't call for your surgeon even he says it's too late
it's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate
don't give me money, honey, i don't want it back
you and your pony face and your union jack
well take your local joker and teach him how to act
i swear i was never that way even when i really cracked
didn't you think i knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive
able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?
and your chelsea suicide with no apparent motive
you could laugh and cry in a single sound
and your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds
remember how i kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god?
you were not quite half so proud when i found you broken on the beach
remember how i poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach
and the band they played the homecoming theme as i caressed your cheek
they ragged, jagged melody she still clings to me like a leach
but that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way
like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way
we were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar
of some metal tempered engine on an alien, distant shore
so you, left to find a better reason than the one we were living for
and it's not that nursery mouth i came back for
it's not the way you're stretched out on the floor
`cause i've broken all your windows and i've rammed through all your doors
and who am i to ask you to lick my sores? and you should know that's true
i came for you, for you, i came for you, but you did not need my urgency
i came for you, for you, i came for you, but your life was one long
emergency
and your cloud line urges me, and my electric surges free"

then all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight
don't worry about me baby, i'll be alright
there's machines and there's fire
on the outside of town
young boys for hire
waiting to blow us all down
there are strange flashes in the sky up above
i'll spend the night at the movies
with my secret love
at dusk the stars all appear on the screen
just like they do each night in my dreams
but tonight's no dream, frankie
i can feel myself move
living and dying
like i was born to do
walk softly tonight little angel
i wanna be alone with you
talk softly to me tonight angel
make all my dream world come true
i remember standing in the freezing rain
reading them ""want"" ads out on chelsea row
winging down the street in search of new games
hustling through the night packs where the actors go
frankie they are crazy, let's run and hide
in the darkness there'll be hidden worlds that shine
when all of the glory in this desperate land
will rise like raindrops in the palm of our hands
rise like the rain
let your sadness rise
walk softly tonight little angel
into the shadows where the lovers go
talk softly tonight angel
whisper your secrets so soft and low"

he worked as a machinist, put his money away
and bought a shrimp boat with his cousin

of america for the americans

billy stood in the shadows
his k bar knife in his hand
and the moon slipped behind the clouds
le lit a cigarette, the bay was still as glass
as he walked by billy stuck his knife into his pocket

girl in the corner eyed him like a hungry dog a bone
as he brushed the desert dust off that mercedes chrome
bartender said ""hey, how's it hangin', tiger?""
he had a shot of tequila, smiled and whispered ""lighter""

"i stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade
i combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
i was open to pain and crossed by the rain and i walked on a crooked crutch
i strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched
i hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `sit down' i stood up
ooh ooh growin' up
the flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing
i had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could
sing
i pushed b 52 and bombed `em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on
standing
i broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to
landing
i hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `come down' i threw
up
ooh ooh growin' up
i took month long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard
to hold your breath
i swear i lost everything i ever loved or feared
i was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
well my feet they finally took root in the earth but i got me a nice little
place in the stars
i swear i found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
i hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said`sit down'i stood up
ooh ooh growin' up
ooh ooh growin' up"

round the campfire light
lovely woman in motion
with hair as dark as night
her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
that hypnotized me with love
she was a gypsy woman
she was a gypsy woman
she was a gypsy woman
she was a gypsy woman
she was a gypsy woman
she danced around and round
guitar's melody
from the fire her face was aglow
how she enchanted me
i'd like to hold her near
and kiss her hair and whisper in her ear
i love you gypsy woman
i love you gypsy woman
i love you gypsy woman
i love you gypsy woman
all through the caravan
she was dancing with all the men
waiting for the rising sun
everyone was having fun
hated to see her go
knowing that she'll never know
that i love her
that i love her
i love you gypsy woman
i love you gypsy woman
i love you gypsy woman
i love you gypsy woman
whoever compared it to part monkey part man hit the nail on the head. it has that same kind of dark, mysterious sound. the vocals are soft and understated, somewhat reminiscent to those on if i should fall behind or pony boy. the song is sung with that nasally twang bruce has grown so fond of lately."

i don't need that sky of blue

happy, darling, come the dark
happy when i taste your kiss
i'm happy in a love like this
there's a house upon a distant hill
where you can hear the laughter of children ring
guardian angels, they watch from above
watching over the love that they bring
but at night i feel the darkness near, i awake and i find you near
i'm happy with you in my arms
i'm happy with you in my heart
happy when i taste your kiss
i'm happy in love like this
in a world of doubt and fear
i wake at night and reach to find you near
lost in a dream, you caught me as i fell
i want more than just a dream to tell
we're born in this world, darling, with few days and trouble never far behind
man and woman circle each other in a cage
a cage that's been handed down the line
lost and running 'neath a million dead stars

happy in each other's arms
happy baby, come the dark
happy in each other's kiss
i m happy in a love like this"

above earth's lamentation.
i hear the real, thought far off hymn
that hails the new creation
above the tumult and the strife,
i hear the music ringing;
it sounds an echo in my soul
how can i keep from singing?
what through the tempest loudly roars,
i hear the truth, it liveth.
what through the darkness round me close,
songs in the night it giveth.
no storm can shake my inmost calm
while to that rock i'm clinging.
since love is lord of heaven and earth
how can i keep from singing?
when tyrants tremble, sick with fear,
and hear their death knell ringing,
when friends rejoice both far and near,
how can i keep from singing?
in prison cell and dungeon vile
our thoughts to them are winging.
when friends by shame are undefiled,
how can i keep from singing?"

when high hope and faith and courage and trust
can rise or vanish like dust and dust

and i ain't got no home in this world anymore
i was farmin' on the shares and always i was poor
my crops i laid into the banker's door
and my wife took down and died upon the cabin floor
and i ain't got no home in this world anymore
i ain't got no home, i'm just a ramblin' around
a hard working ramblin' man, i go from town to town
the police make it hard wherever i may go
and i ain't got no home in this world anymore
now as i look around it's mighty plain to see
this wide wicked world is a funny place to be
the gamblin' man is rich and the workin' man is poor
and i ain't got no home in this world anymore"
"intro to: i sold my heart to the junkman
""...this is a very sad song, this next song we're gonna do.

cry in the backstage a little bit while i'm singing this song. the reason

beautiful girl as she was, she was nice and ... and i gave her my whole
heart, every every bit, and she gave it back to me a month later all

'cause you're so out of sight
i wanna be with you
i wanna be with you

"the guilty undertaker sighs
the lonesome organ grinder cries
the silver saxophone says
i should refuse you
the cracked bells and washed out horns
blow into my face with scorn
but it's not that way
i wasn't born to lose you
i want you i want you
i want you so bad
honey i want you
the drunken politician leaps
upon the streets where mothers weep
and the saviors who are fast asleep
they wait for you
and i wait for them to interrupt
me drinking from my broken cup
and ask me to open up
the gate for you
now all my fathers
they've gone down
true love
they've been without it
but all their daughters
put me down
'cause i don't
think about it
well i return to the queen of spades
and talk with my chamber maid
she knows that i'm not afraid to
look at her
she is good to me and there's
nothing she doesn't see
she knows where i'd like to be
but it doesn't matter
now your dancing child with the chinese suit
he spoke to me i took his flute
no i wasn't very cute to him
was i
but i did it because he lied
because he took you for a ride
and because time was on his side
and because i
want you i want you
i want you so bad
honey i want you"
"i love to see the cottonwood blossom in the early spring
i love to see the message of love that the bluebird brings
but when i see you walking with him down along the strand
i wish i were blind when i see you with your man
i love to see your hair shining in the long summer's light
i love to watch the stars fill the sky on a summer night
the music plays, you take his hand
i watch how you touch him as you start to dance
and i wish i were blind when i see you with your man
we struggle here but all our love's in vain
and these eyes that once filled me with your beauty now fill me with pain
and the light that once entered here is banished from me
and this darkness is all, baby, that my heart sees
and though the world is filled with the grace and beauty of god's hand
oh i wish i were blind when i see you with your man"
"i'll work for your love
pour me a drink theresa in one of those glasses you dust off
and i'll watch the bones in your back like the stations of the cross
'round your hair the sun lifts a halo, at your lips a crown of thorns
whatever the deal's going down, to this one i'm sworn
i'll work for your love dear
i'll work for your love
what others may want for free
i'll work for your love
the dust of civilizations and love's sweet remains
slip off of your fingers and come drifting down like rain
the pages of revelation lie open in your empty eyes of blue
i watch you slip that comb through your hair and this i promise you
i'll work for your love dear
i'll work for your love
what others may want for free
i'll work for your love
well tears they fill the rosary, at your feet my temple of bones
here in this perdition we go on and on
now i see your pieces crumbled and our book of faith's been tossed
and i'm just down here searching for my own piece of the cross
in the late afternoon sun fills the room with a mist in the garden before the fall
i watch your hands smooth the front of your blouse and seven drops of blood fall
i'll work for your love dear
i'll work for your love
what others may want for free
i'll work for your love
what others may want for free
i'll work for your love
what others may want for free
i'll work for your love"
"i ain't afraid of no lions
i ain't afraid of no grizzly bear
i got in a wrestlin' match with old king kong
he didn't even muss my hair
there's just one thing in the whole wide world
that make me doubt my stuff
i'm a coward when it comes to love
now bring down old hulk hogan
king kong bundy too
bring down old big mike tyson
i'll show them what a real man can do
they say the tougher' get goin'
now baby that's when the goin' get tough
but i'm a coward when it comes to love
i'm a coward when it comes to love
i'm a coward when it comes to love
you can bring on a different sexy girl
at every night of the week
buddy that's okay
but i start tremblin', my knees get weak
whenever i hear her say
""do you love me baby?""
""do you love me baby?""
""do you love me baby?""
i got a muscle of iron
i got another muscle made of steel
but when we start kissin' 'n' huggin'
you may be the bravest man in the whole wide world
but buddy, that ain't enough
i'm a coward when it comes to love
i'm a coward when it comes to love
i'm a coward when it comes to love"
"i got a 007 watch and it's a one and only
it's got a i spy beeper that tells me when you're lonely
i got a batmobile so i can reach ya' in a fast shake
when your world's in crisis of an impendin' heartbreak
now don't you call james bond or secret agent man
cause they can't do it, like i can
i'm a rocker, baby, i'm a rocker   every day
i'm a rocker, baby, i'm a rocker
if you're hanging from a cliff or you're tied to the tracks, girl
columbo split and you can't find kojak
true love is broken and your tears are fallin' faster
you're sufferin' from a pain in your heart
or some other natural disaster
now i don't care what kind of shape you're in
if they put up a roadblock, i'll parachute in
i'm a rocker, baby, i'm a rocker   i'm in love
i'm a rocker, baby, i'm a rocker   every day
i'm a rocker, baby, i'm a rocker   with you
so you fell for some jerk who was tall, dark and handsome
then he kidnapped your heart and now he's holdin' it for ransom
well, like a mission impossible i'm gonna go and get it back
you know i would'a taken better care of it, baby, than that
sometimes i get so hot girl, well, i can't talk
but when i'm with you i cool off , and i walk
i'm a rocker, baby, i'm a rocker, and i talk
i'm a rocker, baby, i'm a rocker, every day
i'm a rocker, baby, i'm a rocker, every day"
"we sit in the car outside your house
i can feel the heat coming 'round
i go to put my arm around you
and you give me a look like i'm way out of bounds
well you let out one of your bored sighs
well lately when i look into your eyes
i'm goin down
we get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night
we come home early burning, burning in some fire fight
i'm sick and tired of you setting me up
setting me up just to knock a knock a knock a me down
i pull you close but when we kiss i can feel a doubt
i remember back when we started
my kisses used to turn you inside out
i used to drive you to work in the morning
friday night i'd drive you all around
you used to love to drive me wild
but lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down"
"hey little girl is your daddy home
did he go away and leave you all alone
i got a bad desire
i'm on fire
tell me now baby is he good to you
can he do to you the things that i do
i can take you higher
i'm on fire
hey little girl is your daddy home
did he go away and leave you all alone
i got a bad desire
i'm on fire
tell me now baby is he good to you
can he do to you the things that i do
i can take you higher
i'm on fire
sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
edgy and dull and cut a six inch valley
through the middle of my soul
at night i wake up with the sheets soaking wet
and a freight train running through the
middle of my head
only you can cool my desire
i'm on fire
ooh, ooh, i'm on fire"
"sleepy town ain't got the guts to budge
baby, this emptiness has already been judged
i wanna go out tonight, i wanna find out what i got
you're a strange part of me, you're a preacher's girl
and i don't want no piece of this mechanical world
got my arms open wide and my blood is runnin' hot
we'll take the midnight road right to the devil's door
and even the white angels of eden with their flamin' swords
won't be able to stop us from hittin' town in this dirty old ford
well it don't take no nerve when you got nothin to guard
i got tombstones in my eyes and i'm runnin' real hard
my baby was a lover and the world just blew her away
once they tried to steal my heart, beat it right outta my head
but baby they didn't know that i was born dead
i am the iceman, fightin' for the right to live
i say better than the glory roads of heaven, better off ridin'
hellbound in the dirt, better than the bright lines of the freeway
better than the shadows of your daddy's church
better than the waiting, baby better off is the search"
"we said we'd walk together baby come what may
that come the twilight should we lose our way
if as we're walkin a hand should slip free
i'll wait for you
and should i fall behind
wait for me
we swore we'd travel darlin' side by side
we'd help each other stay in stride
but each lover's steps fall so differently
but i'll wait for you
and if i should fall behind
wait for me
now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true
but you and i know what this world can do
so let's make our steps clear that the other may see
and i'll wait for you
if i should fall behind
wait for me
now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead
there 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed
should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees
i'll wait for you
and should i fall behind
wait for me
darlin' i'll wait for you
should i fall behind
wait for me"

up the stairs, into the fire
up the stairs, into the fire
i need your kiss, but love and duty called you someplace higher

may your strength give us strength
may your faith give us faith
may your hope give us hope
may your love give us love
may your strength give us strength
may your faith give us faith
may your hope give us hope
may your love give us love
you gave your love to see in fields of red and autumn brown
you gave your love to me and lay your young body down
up the stairs, into the fire
up the stairs, into the fire
i need you near but love and duty called you someplace higher
somewhere up the stairs into the fire
may your strength give us strength
may your faith give us faith

may your faith give us faith
may your hope give us hope
may your love give us love
it was dark, too dark to see, you held me in the light you gave
you lay your hand on me
then walked into the darkness of your smoky grave
somewhere up the stairs into the fire
somewhere up the stairs into the fire
i need your kiss, but love and duty called you someplace higher
somewhere up the stairs into the fire

"well i walk the way you want me to
and i'll talk the way you want me to
and i've tried to do all i can just to please you
well i work hard every day for you
and i brought home all my pay for you
and i've cried my tears through the rain night and again
and oh whoa girl, it's a shame
oh whoa girl, it's a doggone shame
we worked so hard, but it's all in vain
oh whoa girl, it's a shame
now i bought your gold and diamond rings
and i brought you home your pretty things
and i thought i'd shown all the love i had for you, yes i did
but as hard as i try it all falls through
well maybe i was born to be just your fool
trying to satisfy your every desire, each need you require
well oh whoa girl, it's a shame
oh whoa girl, it's a doggone shame
i worked so hard, but it's all in vain
oh whoa girl, it's a shame
someone now!
whoa!
whoaaa, whoa hoo
whoa
oh whoa girl, it's a shame
oh girl, it's a doggone shame
we worked so hard, but it's all in vain
oh whoa girl, it's a shame
oh whoa girl, it's a shame
oh girl, it's a doggone shame
i worked so hard, but it's all in vain
oh whoa, girl it's a shame"
"i had skin like leather and the diamond hard look of a cobra
i was born blue and weathered but i burst just like a supernova
i could walk like brando right into the sun
then dance just like a casanova
with my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
silver star studs on my duds like a harley in heat
when i strut down the street i could feel its heartbeat
the sisters fell back and said ""don't that man look pretty""
the cripple on the corner cried out ""nickels for your pity""
them downtown boys sure talk gritty
it's so hard to be a saint in the city
i was the king of the alley i could talk some trash
i was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash
i was the pimp's main prophet i kept everything cool
a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
and when the heat came down it was left on the ground
the devil appeared like jesus through the steam in the street
showin' me a hand i knew even the cops couldn't beat
i felt his hot breath on my neck as i dove into the heat
it's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy
and the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
as the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead
they ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
but it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
you get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat
your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet
then you're outa that hole and back up on the street

"i'll mow your lawn, clean the leaves out your drain
i'll mend your roof to keep out the rain
i'll take the work that god provides
i'm a jack of all trades, honey, we'll be alright
i'll hammer the nails, and i'll set the stone
i'll harvest your crops when they're ripe and grown
i'll pull that engine apart and patch her up 'til she's running right
i'm a jack of all trades, we'll be alright
a hurricane blows, brings a hard rain
when the blue sky breaks, feels like the world's gonna change
we'll start caring for each other like jesus said that we might
i'm a jack of all trades, we'll be alright
the banker man grows fatter, the working man grows thin
it's all happened before and it'll happen again
it'll happen again, they'll bet your life
i'm a jack of all trades and, darling, we'll be alright
now sometimes tomorrow comes soaked in treasure and blood
here we stood the drought, now we'll stand the flood
there's a new world coming, i can see the light
i'm a jack of all trades, we'll be alright
so you use what you've got, and you learn to make do
you take the old, you make it new
if i had me a gun, i'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight
i'm a jack of all trades, we'll be alright
i'm a jack of all trades, we'll be alright"
"driving home she grabs something to eat
turns a corner and drives down her street
into a row of houses she just melts away
like the scenery in another man's play
into a house where the blinds are closed
to keep from seeing things she don't wanna know
she pulls the blinds and looks out on the street
the cool of the night takes the edge off the heat
in the jackson cage
down in jackson cage
you can try with all your might
but you're reminded every night
that you been judged and handed life
down in jackson cage
every day ends in wasted motion
just crossed swords on the killing floor
to settle back is to settle without knowing
the hard edge that you're settling for
because there's always just one more day
and it's always gonna be that way
little girl you've been down here so long
i can tell by the way that you move you belong to
the jackson cage
down in jackson cage
and it don't matter just what you say
are you tough enough to play the game they play
or will you just do your time and fade away
down into the jackson cage
baby there's nights when i dream of a better world
but i wake up so downhearted girl
i see you feeling so tired and confused
i wonder what it's worth to me or you
just waiting to see some sun
never knowing if that day will ever come
left alone standing out on the street
till you become the hand that turns the key down in
jackson cage
down in jackson cage
well darlin' can you understand
the way that they will turn a man
into a stranger to waste away
down in the jackson cage"

"well it's saturday night in new jersey
and you're feeling kinda wet
now the summer heat is getting you worried
so you try to look as innocent as you can as you sweat
and you've got a woman on the other side of the law
but it ain't cool to go see her yet
because her ex old man's a city cop
who thinks he's auditioning for dragnet
so you stand on the corner looking kinda torn
and in the blue light lounge
where death was born
the jazz musician blows his horn
you pop a letter to your baby in richmond
'cause you're feeling pretty down
she's kinda small but at least she's a rich one
oh, and she needs you real bad
and sometimes that's all that counts
you had a teenage band and flying hands
and oh, you was pretty big, you were pretty big in the
south
but you passed out on stage and flew into a rage
and someone tried to revive you
mouth to mouth
you felt a pain in your chest
as you passed the crown
and in the blue light lounge
the lights went down
and the audience slipped silently out of town
well now the atheist he burns you for laughing out loud
because he can't understand what you're saying
and the word's out when they pushed him in the hole
everybody knows that he went out praying
oh, now the park is dark but the sidewalk's bright
and alive with the light of the living
oh and mama can i walk you home tonight
'cause it's a big bad city
and this boy's got a lot for the givingi'm stranded in the jungle
first stage witness at a company killing
i'm clutching my high school diploma, shuffling my feet
promised sixty bucks a week
and guaranteed top billing
well you can live a life of love in new york
only if you don't, if you don't love living
and i met this taxi driver who drives me around town
telling tales of his back seat women
and out on the corner there's no room to move
'cause everybody's trying so hard to groove
and in the blue light lounge
the jazz musician plays his blues"
"i got no time for the corner boys
down in the street making all that noise
don't want no whores on 8th avenue

across the river to the jersey side
take my baby to the carnival
and i'll take her on all the rides

when i'm wrapped up in my baby's arms
my little girl gives me everything
i know that some day she'll wear my ring
so don't bother me, man! i ain't got no time
i'm on my way to see that girl of mine
`cause nothing matters in this whole wide world
when you're in love with a jersey girl
sha la la la...
i see you on the street and you look so tired
i know that job you got leaves you so uninspired
when i come by to take you out to eat
you're lyin' all dressed up on the bed,baby,fast asleep

we're gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom's
i know a place where the dancing's free

"jesus was an only son
as he walked up calvary hill
his mother mary walking beside him
in the path where his blood spilled
jesus was an only son
in the hills of nazareth
as he lay reading the psalms of david
at his mother's feet
a mother prays, ""sleep tight, my child, sleep well
for i'll be at your side
that no shadow, no darkness, no tolling bell,
shall pierce your dreams this night""
in the garden at gethsemane
he prayed for the life he'd never live,
he beseeched his heavenly father to remove
the cup of death from his lips
now there's a loss that can never be replaced,
a destination that can never be reached
a light you'll never find in another's face,
a sea whose distance cannot be breached
well jesus kissed his mother's hands
whispered, ""mother, still your tears,
for remember the soul of the universe
willed a world and it appeared"

and put her little boy on the greyhound bus
leaving memphis with a guitar in his hand
with a one way ticket to the promised land
hey little girl with the red dress on
there's party tonight down in memphis down

you didn't have to die
you didn't have to die
(all aboard!
train i ride...
sixteen coaches long)
just like a woman 
nobody feels any pain
tonight as i stand inside the rain
everybody knows
that baby has got me closed
but lately i see her ribbons and her bows
have fallen from her curls
she takes just like a woman, yes she does
she makes love just like a woman, yes she does
and she aches just like a woman
but she breaks just like a little girl
queen mary she's my friend
yes i believe i'll go see her again
nobody has to guess
that baby can't be blessed
'till she finally sees
that she's like all the rest
with her fog her amphetamine and her pearls
it was raining from the first
and i was dying there of thirst
so i came in here
and your long time curse hurts
but what's worse
is this pain in here
i can't stay in here
ain't it clear that i just can't fit
yes i believe it's for us to quit
when we meet again introduced as friends
please don't let on that you knew me when
i was hungry and it was your world
ah you fake just like a woman, yes you do
you make love just like a woman, yes you do
and you ache just like a woman
but you break just like a little girl"
"the rangers had a homecoming in harlem late last night
and the magic rat drove his sleek machine over the jersey state line
barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a dodge
drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
the rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
together they take a stab at romance and disappear down flamingo lane
well the maximum lawman run down flamingo chasing the rat and the barefoot
girl
and the kids round here look just like shadows always quiet, holding hands
from the churches to the jails tonight all is silence in the world
as we take our stand down in jungleland
the midnight gang's assembled and picked a rendezvous for the night
they'll meet `neath that giant exxon sign that brings this fair city light
man there's an opera out on the turnpike
there's a ballet being fought out in the alley
until the local cops, cherry tops, rips this holy night
the street's alive as secret debts are paid
contacts made, they vanished unseen
kids flash guitars just like switch blades hustling for the record machine
the hungry and the hunted explode into rock'n'roll bands
that face off against each other out in the street down in jungleland
in the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the d.j. plays
lonely hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
desperate as the night moves on, just a look and a whisper, and they're gone
beneath the city two hearts beat
soul engines running through a night so tender in a bedroom locked
in whispers of soft refusal and then surrender in the tunnels uptown
the rat's own dream guns him down as shots echo down them hallways in the
night
no one watches when the ambulance pulls away
or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
between flesh and what's fantasy and the poets down here
don't write nothing at all, they just stand back and let it all be
and in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
and try to make an honest stand but they wind up wounded, not even dead
tonight in jungleland"
"one night in a motel room
eyes cast like steel
i drank the wine they had left on my table
i knew the morning was too far
i smoke my last cigarette
stay only to defy
the night was dark and the land was cold
it's frozen right to the bone
and just like fire would, i burn up
just like fire would
just like fire would, i burn up
five hundred miles i have gone today
tomorrow it's five hundred more
outside my window the world passes by
it's stranger than a dream
just like fire would, i burn up
just like fire would
just like fire would, i burn up
i go to work and i earn my pay load
my sweat, it falls to the ground
i see you now but we may never meet again, child
the ice is hanging on the door
one night in a motel room
eyes cast like steel
i drank the wine they had left on my table
i knew the morning was too far
just like fire would, i burn up
just like fire would
just like fire would, i burn up"
"with you i don't hear the minutes ticking by
i don't feel the hours as they fly
i don't see the summer as it wanes
just a subtle change of light upon your face
walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
this is our kingdom of days
i watch the sun as it rises and sets
i watch the moon trace its arc with no regrets
my jacket 'round your shoulders, the falling leaves
the wet grass on our backs as the autumn breeze drifts through the trees
walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
this is our kingdom of days
this is our kingdom of days
i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you, i do
you whisper ""then prove it, then prove it, then prove it to me baby blue""
and i count my blessings that you're mine for always
we laugh beneath the covers and count the wrinkles and the grays
sing away, sing away, sing away, sing away
sing away, sing away, my darling, we'll sing away
this is our kingdom of days
this is our kingdom of days
this is our kingdom of days
this is our kingdom of days
this is our kingdom of days"

cuban heels on your boots

knights of columbus and the fireman's ball
friday night at the union hall
black leather clubs all along route 9

flock of angels lift me somehow
somewhere high and hard and loud
somewhere deep into the heart of the crowd

out of school and out of work
thrift store jeans and flannel shirt
the lights go down and we face the crowd

now your legs were heaven your breasts were the altar
your body was the holy land
you shouted ""jump"" but my heart faltered
you laughed and said ""baby don't you understand?""
it takes a leap of faith to get things going
it takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts
it takes a leap of faith to get things going
in your heart you must trust
now you were the red sea i was moses
i kissed you and slipped into a bed of roses
the waters parted and love rushed inside
i was jesus' son sanctified
tonight the moon's looking young but i'm feelin' younger
'neath a veil of dreams sweet blessings rain
honey i can feel the first breeze of summer
and in your love i'm born again
it takes a leap of faith to get things going
it takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts
it takes a leap of faith to get things going
in your heart you must trust

"we met down in the valley where the wine of love and destruction flowed
there in that curve of darkness where the flowers of temptation grow
i left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else
you felt so good to me baby, good as life itself
you were life itself, rushing over me
life itself, the wind in black elms,
life itself in your heart and in your eyes, i can't make it without you
i knew you were in trouble anyone could tell
you carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell
you squandered all your riches your beauty and your wealth
like you had no further use for, for life itself
you were life itself, rushing over me
life itself, the wind in black elms,
life itself in your heart and in your eyes, i can't make it without you
why do the things that we treasure most, slip away in time
till to the music we grow deaf, to god's beauty blind
why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart?
till we fall away in our own darkness, a stranger to our own hearts
and life itself, rushing over me
life itself, the wind in black elms,
life itself in your heart and in your eyes, i can't make it without you
so here's one for the road, here's one to your health and to
life itself, rushing over me
life itself, the wind in the black elms,
life itself in your heart and in your eyes, i can't make it without you
life itself, life itself, life itself..."

calls
linda will you let me be the one
linda will you, hey let me be the one
linda will you let me be the one
linda will you let me be the one
in a room full of contenders
shadow boxin', eddie's strong

to the canvas draped in scarves
stole from linda's bedroom

and the midnight boys were wasted
down on king street
he calls out

linda will you, hey let me be the one

midnight boys hide from the rain
stay with the stolen sisters
till the streets are dry again
talking fast cars and chrome parts
different worlds and strange girls
empty homes, busted hearts
and kneeling with linda in the dark
linda will you let me be the one
linda will you, hey let me be the one
linda will you let me be the one"

i still heard it playing
i moved a little closer to hear
the words she was saying
she said i'll never break your heart
i'll never try to fake it
my love is here for you
all you have to do is take it
kisses sweeter than wine
my little girl so fine
the night seemed to say it was right
but could i believe her
my heart said, it's time to go
but my eyes wouldn't leave her
there's always somebody trying to break your heart
somebody trying to take it
my little girl tried so hard
to help me make it

take a chance
on what tomorrow brings
won't you be mine, be mine

into the night for ever and ever and ever
now i know
i'll never break me baby's heart
i'll never try to fake it
i'll give her all my love
all she has to do is take it

"she said we could just sleep together,
there'd be nothing wrong.
we could just hold each other with our clothes on.
i went to answer, i don't think we should.
then i heard a voice say, yeah, i guess we could.
she kissed me lightly and said you know sometimes when you're down,
it's the little things that count
it's the little things that count
it's the little things...
she said it was too late, i really shouldn't try to drive.
she unbuttoned my shirt and whispered just close your eyes.
here, let me take your boots off, you know sometimes when your luck's run out
it's the little things that count
it's the little things that count
it's the little things...
bridge: her dress rode lightly as she walked
then she pulled the covers down.
well i was so dry, she held a water glass to my lips,
and the polish on her nail was chipped.
she said she had a boyfriend that i reminded her of.
his hair was the same muddy brown; she stuck her tongue in my mouth..."
"we met on open streets where we both had no place to go
i remember how my heart beat when you said
""oh billy i love you so""
now, standing in the doorway
did you ever think that we could look this old
victims of the little white lies that we told
we did not count tomorrows
we took what we could and ran
there was no time for sorrow
every place you went i held your hand
and when the night closed in
i was sure your kisses told me all i had to know
but they never whispered the little white lies that we told
it was so good at the start, nothing could ever pull it apart
running hand in hand through the rain
but soon the heart break, soon the pain, girl
there were no cold denials, nobody really lied
it wasn't in the things we said, girl
just time spent, promises implied
and when it began to fall apart
eaten quietly away from the inside
bit by bit by those little white lies
hey!
hey!
hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey, hey hey hey!
now standing in the doorway
did you ever think, ever think that we could look this old
victims of the little white lies that we told
now lying here in the dark
did you ever think, ever think that we could be this cold
just as cold as the little white lies that we told
little white lies
little white lies
little white lies
little white lies
little white lies"

the sea rose towards the sun
i opened up my heart to you
it got all damaged and undone
my ship liberty sailed away
on a bloody red horizon
the groundskeeper opened the gates
and let the wild dogs run
alone i limp through town
a lost cowboy at sundown
got my monkey on a leash
got my ear tuned to the ground
my faith's been torn asunder
tell me is that rollin' thunder
or just the sinkin' sound
of somethin' righteous goin' under
don't worry, darlin'
no baby, don't you fret
we're livin' in the future

"well now on a summer night in a dusky room
come a little piece of the lord's undying light
crying like he swallowed the fiery moon
in his mother's arms it was all the beauty i could take
like the missing words to some prayer that i could never make
in a world so hard and dirty so fouled and confused
searching for a little bit of god's mercy
i found living proof
i put my heart and soul i put 'em high upon a shelf
right next to the faith the faith that i'd lost in myself
i went down into the desert city
just tryin' so hard to shed my skin
i crawled deep into some kind of darkness
lookin' to burn out every trace of who i'd been
you do some sad sad things baby
when it's your you 're tryin' to lose
you do some sad and hurtful things
i've seen living proof
you shot through my anger and rage
to show me my prison was just an open cage
there were no keys no guards
just one frightened man and some old shadows for bars
well now all that's sure on the boulevard
is that life is just a house of cards
as fragile as each and every breath
of this boy sleepin' in our bed
tonight let's lie beneath the eaves
just a close band of happy thieves
and when that train comes we'll get on board
and steal what we can from the treasures of the lord
it's been along long drought baby
tonight the rain's pourin' down on our roof
looking for a little bit of god's mercy

between the doberman and bruce lee?""
she said ""just a local hero""
""local hero"" she said with a smile
""yeah a local hero he used to live here for a while""
i met a stranger dressed in black
at the train station
he said ""son your soul can be saved""
there's a beautiful women nights of low livin'
and some dangerous money to be made
there's a big town 'cross the whiskey line
and if we turn the right card up
they make us boss the devil pays off
and them folks that are real hard up
they get their local hero
somebody with the right style
they get their local hero
somebody with just the right smile
well i learned my job i learned it well
fit myself with religion and a story to tell
first they made me the king then they made me pope
then they brought the rope
i woke to a gypsy girl sayin' ""drink this""
well my hands had lost all sensation
these days i'm feeling all right
'cept i can't tell my courage from my desperation
from the tainted chalice
well i drunk some heady wine
tonight i'm layin' here
but there's something in my ear
sayin' there's a little town just beneath the floodline
needs a local hero
somebody with the right style
lookin' for a local hero
someone with the right smile

"met her at a friendly little bar down along the coast
she said it was her birthday so we had us a nice little toast
drove around for a while, smoked a few cigarettes
took her back to my place, she slipped off her party dress
she sat for a while on the edge of the bed just talkin'
loose change in my pocket
loose change in my pocket
pint of gin in my boot cuff, i'm drivin' for a drink and a dance
sittin' on the next stool, miss a little time on her hands
yeah i knew she was trouble, but trouble sure was lookin' fine
and when i pulled her close what i knew kinda slipped my mind
we lay in bed and watched the moon come up crawling
loose change in my pocket
loose change in my pocket
i pour another drink, wait for the night to get through
stars are burning in that black void so far away and blue
now i'm sittin' at a red light i feel somethin' tickin' way down
the night's moving like a slow train crawling through this shithole town
got my bags packed in the back and i'm tryin' to get going again
but red just goes to green and green goes red and then
then all i hear's the clock on the dash tick tocking
loose change in my pocket
loose change in my pocket"
"we met out on open streets
when we had no place to go
i remember how my heart beat
when you said ""i love you so""
then little by little
we choked out all the life that out love could hold
no, no
it was like we held a noose
and baby without check
we pulled it a little tighter around our necks
each one waiting for the other
darling to say when
now baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end
we didn't count tomorrows
we took what we had and baby we ran
there was no place for sorrow
every place we went i held your hand
and when the night closed in
i was sure your kisses told me all i had to know
but oh no
it was like we held a noose
and baby without check
we pulled 'til it grew tighter around our necks
each one waiting for the other
darling to say when
oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end
our love has fallen around us
like we said it never would
we saw it happen to all the others
but to us it never would
well how could something so bad, darling
come from something that was so good
i don't know
but it was like we held a noose
and baby without check
we pulled 'til it grew tighter around our necks
each one waiting for the other
darling to say when
oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end
on a loose end"
"the ragamuffin gunner is returnin' home like a hungry runaway
he walks through town all alone
he must be from the fort he hears the high school girls say
his countryside's burnin' with wolfman fairies dressed in drag for homicide
the hit and run, plead sanctuary, `neath a holy stone they hide
they're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection
nuns run bald through vatican halls pregnant, pleadin' immaculate conception
and everybody's wrecked on main street from drinking unholy blood
sticker smiles sweet as gunner breathes deep, his ankles caked in mud
and i said ""hey gunner man that's quicksand, that's quicksand that ain't mud
have you thrown your senses to the war or did you lose them in the flood?""
that pure american brother, dull eyed and empty faced
races sundays in jersey in a chevy stock super eight
he rides `er low on the hip, on the side he's got bound for glory in red, white and blue flash paint
he leans on the hood telling racing stories, the kids call him jimmy the
saint
well the blaze and noise boy, he's gunnin' that b**** loaded to blastin' point
he rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point
and there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell
that is, nothin' left that you could sell
just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell
and he said ""hey kid, you think that's oil? man, that ain't oil that's blood""
i wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm
or was he just lost in the flood?
eighth avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air
some storefront incarnation of maria, she's puttin' on me the stare
and bronx's best apostle stands with his hand on his own hard ware
everything stops, you hear five, quick shots, the cops come up for air
and now the whiz bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street
and that cat from the bronx starts lettin' loose but he gets blown right off his feet
and some kid comes blastin' round the corner but a cop puts him right away
he lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in spanish
still breathing when i walked away
and somebody said ""hey man did you see that? his body hit the street with
such a beautiful thud""
i wonder what the dude was sayin' or was he just lost in the flood?
hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure messed up
i wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they just lost in the flood?"
"livin' on free food, tickets
water in the milk from the hole in the roof
where the rain came through
what can you do? hmm
tears from little sister cryin'
'cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch
for the party to go
oh, but you know she'll get by
she is livin' in the love of the common people
smiles from the heart of the family man
daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
mama's gonna love her just as much as she can, she can
it's a good thing you don't have the bus fare
it would fall through the hole in your pocket
and you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
a walking to town to find a job
trying to keep your hands warm
but the hole in your shoe let the snow come through
and it chills to the bone, boy
you'd better go home where it's warm
where you can live in the love of the common people
smiles from the heart of the family man
daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
mama's gonna love her just as much as she can, she can
livin' on dreams ain't easy
but the closer the knit the tighter the fit
and the chills stay away
you take 'em in stride family pride
you know that faith is your foundation
and with a whole lotta love and a warm conversation
and plenty of prayer
making you strong where you belong
where you can live in the love of the common people
smiles from the heart of the family man
daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
mama's gonna love her just as much as she can, she can..."

that mansion on the hill
in the day you can see the children playing
on the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel
steel gates that completely surround, sir,
the mansion on the hill
at night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride
through the streets of a town so silent and still
park on a back road along the highway side
look up at that mansion on the hill
in the summer all the lights would shine
there'd be music playin', people laughin' all the time
me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall cornfields
sit and listen to the mansion on the hill

i watch the cars rushin' by, home from the mill

above the mansion on the hill"

she give me candy stick kisses 'neath a wolf dog moon
one sweet breath and she'll take you, mister, to the upper room

so cold, the fishermen cry
she rapes me in a rage of rainbow violence

like the strings of a violin

soaked in colours, red as blood, blue as night

carves her initials in my side
lures me with her purrs and cuts me with her knife
and the horses pound like thunder
they bolt like lightning on her range
she feels she's going under and she zeros in the rein
she's so strange
well, marie, you know, she's the queen of all the stallions
and i'm her prince of mules
and one of her principal fools
marie, she's got the claws of a falcon
and she's perched on my shoulder, and slowly digging in
but she, oh she can be so strange sometimes
like at night ...
or when the neighbors come to dine
marie, she skins me alive
burns her initials in my hide and then leaves me all alone
branded to the bone
and my heart pounds like her horses
oh, stampeding on the range
marie knows all the sources
and she shoots me with her pain
and for her, i take it, lord, down in my veins
and i watch her dance like some berserk fairy
all across the concrete prairies of bleecker street

for two days the river keeps you down
then you rise to the light without a sound
past the playgrounds and empty switching yards

and the things of the earth they make their claim
that the things of heaven may do the same

my pockets full of dust, my mouth filled with cool stone
the pale moon opens the earth to its bones

last night i dreamed the sky went black
you were drifting down, couldn't get back
lost in trouble, so far from home
i reached for you, my arms were like stone
oh, but you were missing, missing... missing
searched for something to explain
in the whispering rain and the trembling **
tell me baby, where did you go
you were here just a moment ago
at nights i still hear your footsteps fall
i can hear your voice moving down the hall
drifting through the bedroom
i lie awake but i don't move"
"there's a place on a blank stretch of road where
nobody travels and nobody goes and the
deskman says these days 'round here
two young folks could probably up and disappear into
rustlin' sheets, a sleepy corner room
into the musty smell
of wilted flowers and lazy afternoon hours
at the moonlight motel
now the pool's filled with empty, eight foot deep
got dandelions growin' up through the cracks in the concrete
chain link fence half rusted away
got a sign says ""children be careful how you play""
your lipstick taste and your whispered secret i promised i'd never tell
a half drunk beer and your breath in my ear
at the moonlight motel
well then it's bills and kids and kids and bills and the ringing of the bell
across the valley floor through the dusty screen door
of the moonlight motel
last night i dreamed of you, my lover
and the wind blew through the window and blew off the covers
of my lonely bed, i woke to something you said
that it's better to have loved, yeah it's better to have loved
as i drove, there was a chill in the breeze
and leaves tumbled from the sky and fell
onto a road so black as i backtracked
to the moonlight motel
she was boarded up and gone like an old summer song
nothing but an empty shell
i pulled in and stopped into my old spot
i pulled a bottle of jack out of a paper bag
poured one for me and one for you as well
then it was one more shot poured out onto the parking lot
to the moonlight motel"

"bobby's got a gun that he keeps beneath his pillow out on the streets your chances are zero take a look around you it ain't too complicated
you're messin' with murder incorporated
now you check over your shoulder everywhere that you go walkin down the streets, there's eyes in every shadow you better take a look around you that equipment you got's so outdated
you can't compete with murder incorporated
everywhere you look now there's murder incorporated
so you keep a little secret down deep inside your dresser drawer
from dealing with the heat you're feelin' down on the killin' floor
no matter where you step you feel you're never out of danger
so complicated you keep complaining some bones hurtin'
i hear that you, you got dogged downtown, man it leaves your head cold (oh
yea)
and everywhere you look life ain't got no soul 
that apartment you live in feels like it's just a place to hide
when your walkin' down the streets you won't need nowhere there to hide
now the cops reported you as just another homicide
i could tell that you was just frustrated from livin' with murder
incorporated
incorporated
everywhere you look now
murder incorporated
down on your knees
murder
everywhere that you turn it's murder
murder
everywhere you look there's murder.

"well i sought gold and diamond rings
my own drug to ease the pain that living brings
walked from the mountain to the valley floor
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward
from a house on a hill a sacred light shines
i walk through these rooms but none of them are mine
down empty hallways i went from door to door
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward
well your hair shone in the sun
i was so high i was the lucky one
then i came crashing down like a drunk on a barroom floor
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward
tonight i can feel the cold wind at my back
i'm flyin' high over gray fields my feathers long and black
down along the river's silent edge i soar
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward"

"last night i dreamed that i was a child
out where the pines grow wild and tall
i was trying to make it home through the forest
before the darkness falls
i heard the wind rustling through the trees
and ghostly voices rose from the fields
i ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
with the devil snappin' at my heels
i broke through the trees, and there in the night
my father's house stood shining hard and bright
the branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
but i ran till i fell, shaking in his arms
i awoke and i imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
i got dressed, and to that house i did ride
from out on the road, i could see its windows shining in light
i walked up the steps and stood on the porch
a woman i didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
i told her my story, and who i'd come for
she said ""i'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore""
my father's house shines hard and bright
it stands like a beacon calling me in the night
calling and calling, so cold and alone
shining `cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned"
"at night i go to bed
but i just can't sleep
i got something runnin' around my head
ooh that just won't keep
in the silence i hear my heart beatin'
time slippin' away
i got a time bomb tickin' deep inside of me
girl all i want to say
i keep searchin' for you darlin'
searchin everywhere i go
and when i find you there's gonna be just one thing that you gotta know
one thing you gotta know
my love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
my love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
at night i walk the streets lookin' for romance
but i always end up stumblin' in a half trance
i search for a connection in some new eyes
that hardly protect you from too many dreams passed by
i see you standin, across the room watchin' me without a sound
i'm gonna push my way through that crowd
i'm gonna tear your holy walls down
tear all your walls down
my love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
my love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
my love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down

or was it just that simple thing that led you from these arms of mine
oh yes, i've had the days
to grow used to your foolish ways
and what is it really, after all, my lover man
i can see the change in your eyes
there's no need to apologize
we stood at the wishing well
our dreams like coins into the water fell
the water so cold and black
there was no going back
i don't mean to cause you hurt or cause you pain
life is short and love's a dirty game
now there's no need for our game to end
come close and we'll begin
to find our beautiful selves again, my loverman

on a day when chance is all
in the dark of this exile

baby you're my lucky day
when i've lost all the other bets i've made
honey you're my lucky day
i've seen strong hearts give way
to the burdens of the day
to the weary hands of time
where fortune is not kind

"when they opened up the strip i was young and full of zip,
i wanted a place to call my own.
and so i made the race, and staked me out a place,
and settled down along the cimarron.
it blowed away, it blowed away,
my oklahoma home, it blowed away.
it looked so green and fair when i built my shanty there,
but my oklahoma home, it blowed away.
i planted wheat and oats, got some chickens and some shoats,
aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face.
got a mule to pull the plow, got an old red muley cow
and got a fancy mortgage on the place.
it blowed away, it blowed away,
all the crops i planted blowed away.
you can't grow any grain if there isn't any rain;
all except the mortgage blowed away.
it blowed away my rooster and it blowed away my hens;
the pigs and cattle went astray.
all the crops that i sowed went a foggin' down the road.
my oklahoma farm, it blowed away.
it blowed away, it blowed away,
everything i owned blowed away.
i hollered and i cussed when my land went up in dust,
when my oklahoma farm, it blowed away.
it looked so green and fair, when i built my shanty there,
i figured i was all set for life.
i put on my sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest
and went to town and picked me out a wife.
she blowed away, she blowed away
my oklahoma woman blowed away.
just as i bent and kissed her, she was picked up by a twister;
my oklahoma woman blowed away.
then i was left alone a listenin' to the moan
of the wind around the corners of my shack;
so i took off down the road when the south wind blowed,
a travelin' with the wind at my back.
i blowed away, i blowed away
chasin' a dust cloud up ahead.
once it looked so green and fair, now it's up there in the air;
my oklahoma farm is overhead.
now i'm always close to home no matter where i roam,
for oklahoma dust is everywhere.
makes no difference where i'm walkin', i can hear my chickens squawkin'
i can hear my wife a talkin' in the air.
it blowed away, it blowed away,
my oklahoma home blowed away.
but my home is always near; it's in the atmosphere,
my oklahoma home that blowed away.
i'm a roamin' oklahoman, but i'm always close to home
and i'll never get homesick 'til i die.
no matter where i'm found, my home is all around;
my oklahoma home is in the sky.
it blowed away, it blowed away,
my farm down upon the cimarron.
but all around the world, wherever dust is whirled,
some is from my oklahoma home.
it blowed away, it blowed away,
my oklahoma home blowed away.
oh it's up there in the sky in that dust cloud rolling by,
my oklahoma home is in the sky."

so she says: ""don't talk, babe, just sing""

oh, and she loves me like such a good woman
and still, oh, she's just a sweet young thing
and i know this might sound crazy
or just the words of a young fool

and she ever walked out the door
i swear i'd wish that she would shoot me first

"tonight down on union street
i'm thinkin' back, baby, to you and me
to the way you used to be
and your words come back to me
from passing cars
their voices sing out
in empty bars where guitars ring out
we'd be the lucky one to get out
you said, none baby but the brave
no one baby but the brave
oh strong enough to save something
from what they gave
none baby but the brave
no one baby but the brave
now in dreams these nights i see you my friend
the way you were back then
ah, on a night like this
i know that girl no longer exists
except for a moment in some stranger's eyes
or in a nameless girl
in cars rushin' by
that's where i find you tonight
and in my heart it still survives
to none, baby, but the brave
no one baby but the brave
oh strong enough to save
something from the love they gave
yeah, none baby but the brave
no one baby but the brave
now tonight once more i search
every face on that crowded floor
looking for i don't know what for
something that ain't there no more
there's a girl standin' by the band
she reminds me of you
and i asked her to danceas the drummer counts his play
i take her hand and we move away
and tonight, now i'll see old friends
caught in things they got no chance to win
just gettin' beaten, and then playin' again
'till their strength gives out
or their hearts give in
who's that man who thinks
he can decide whose dreams will live
and who shall be pushed aside
did he ever walk down this streets at night
and looked into the eyes
baby, of none, baby, but the brave
no one baby but the brave
no, none baby but the brave
no one baby but the brave
no one baby,no one but the brave"
"i don't remember how i felt
i never thought i'd live
to read about myself
in my hometown paper
how my brave young life
was forever changed
in a misty cloud of pink vapor
darlin' give me your kiss
only understand
i am, the nothing man
around here, everybody acts the same
around here, everybody acts like nothing's changed
friday night, the club meets at al's barbecue
the sky's still, the same unbelievable blue
darlin' give me your kiss
come and take my hand
i am, the nothing man
you can call me joe
buy me a drink and shake my hand
you want courage
i'll show you courage you can understand
the pearl and silver
restin' on my night table
it's just me lord, pray i'm able
darlin, with this kiss
say you understand
i am, the nothing man
i am, the nothing man"
"oh, mary, don't you weep
tell martha not to moan
pharaoh's army drowned in the red sea
oh, mary, don't you weep
tell martha not to moan
if i could i surely would
stand on the rock where moses stood
pharaoh's army drowned in the red sea
oh, mary, don't you weep
tell martha not to moan
you know jesus... he's my friend
he picks me up when i fall down again
every day i get on my knees and pray
that the lord's hand will come and show the way
and i just thank him each day that i live
i give him all that i have to give ... every day!
jesus, he told mary, ""don't you weep no more
just believe in a miracle
every day there's a miracle in your life
you've just got to look for it
have faith in your heart, in your soul, every day"".
jesus told mary, ""don't you no more
'cause i'm coming back again... yes i am!""
now mary had a brother named lazarus
one day when jesus was praying to the masses
lazarus passed away.
mary she lost faith
she got sick at the heart
she didn't believe
jesus came back
he told mary, ""don't you weep... 'cause i can fix it!""
he said lazarus, ""rise up and walk with te livig""
and lazarus rose up ... o what a miracle
jesus told mary, ""you don't have to weep
no you don't have to moan!""
oh, mary, don't you weep
tell martha not to moan"

"woke up this morning my house was cold
checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'
went out and hoped in my old ford
hit the engine but she ain't turnin'
we've given each other some hard lessons lately
but we ain't learnin'
we're the same sad story that's a fact
one step up and two steps back
bird on a wire outside my motel room
but he ain't singin'
girl in white outside a church in june
but the church bells they ain't ringing
i'm sitting here in this bar tonight
but all i'm thinkin' is
i'm the same old story same old act
one step up and two steps back
it's the same thing night on night
who's wrong baby who's right
another fight and i slam the door on
another battle in our dirty little war
when i look at myself i don't see
the man i wanted to be
somewhere along the line i slipped off track
i'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back
there's a girl across the bar
i get the message she's sending
mmm she ain't lookin' to married
and me well honey i'm pretending
last night i dreamed i held you in my arms
the music was never ending
we danced as the evening sky faded to black
one step up and two steps back"
"if the sun should fall from the skytomorrow
if the rain brings the tears to your eye, i would share your sorrow
but you must go if you can't take the heat, our love was fine, our love was sweet
but we was walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street
well i'm not with all those guys, who rode out in your eyes
sometimes, ya sometimes, i can't forget your lines
but hold the train, just come today, and for your wrong, well you must pay
and we're walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street
if i'm old my darlin' eye, i must confess
that this can't be love, no i must be a man possessed
when i look in your eyes so bright, your walkin' and your dress fits you just right
but we were walkin' on a dead end, runnin' down a one way street
well their's a man, could change the things, he feels inside
if for once i, could turn and make it swallow some of my pride
but for the wrongs, oh yes we must pay, so its bye bye baby today
and we'll go walkin' on that wildside, runnin' down a one way street
yeah when i think, of all the girls, that i have i missed
well i know i, would give them up, for just one kiss
that's nn..we, we are the same kind, and to leave you baby, i have to go blind
oh when we're walkin' on the wildside, runnin' down a one way street
oh oh yes we are, we'll keep walkin' on that badside, runnin' down that one way street

"well, i had the carburetor, baby, cleaned and checked
with her line blown out she's hummin' like a turbojet
propped her up in the backyard on concrete blocks
for a new clutch plate and a new set of shocks
took her down to the carwash, check the plugs and point
well, i'm goin' out tonight. i'm gonna rock that joint
early north jersey industrial skyline
i'm a all set cobra jet creepin' through the nighttime

gotta hit the gas, baby. i'm running late
this new jersey in the mornin' like a lunar landscape
now, the boss don't dig me, so he put me on the night shift
it's an all night run to get back to where my baby lives
in the wee, wee hours your mind gets hazy
radio relays towers, won't you lead me to my baby?
underneath the overpass, trooper hits his party light switch
good night, good luck. one, two power shift
i met wanda when she was employed
behind the counter at route sixty bob's big boy fried chicken
on the front seat, she's sittin' in my lap
we're wipin' our fingers on a texaco road map
i remember wanda up on scrap metal hill
with them big brown eyes that make your heart stand still
well, at five a.m., oil pressure's sinkin' fast
i make a pit stop, wipe the windshield, check the gas
gotta call my baby on the telephone
let her know that her daddy's comin' on home
sit tight, little mama, i'm comin' `round
i got three more hours, but i'm coverin' ground
your eyes get itchy in the wee, wee hours
sun's just a red ball risin' over them refinery towers
radio's jammed up with gospel stations
lost souls callin' long distance salvation

hey, ho, rock'n'roll, deliver me from nowhere"

"8 a.m. i'm up and my feet beating on the sidewalk
down at the unemployment agency, all i get is talk
i check the want ads but there just ain't nobody hiring
what's a man supposed to do when he's down and he's
out of work
i need a job, i'm out of work
i'm unemployed, i'm out of work
i need a job, i'm out of work
i go to pick my girl up
her name is linda brown
her dad invites me in
he tells me to sit down

we got to do our best to whip that inflation down

"he was born a little baby on the appalachian trail
at six months old he'd done three months in jail
he robbed a bank in his diapers and little bare baby feet
all he said was ""folks my name is outlaw pete""
i'm outlaw pete, i'm outlaw pete, can you hear me?
at 25 a mustang pony he did steal
and he rode her 'round and 'round on heaven's wheel
father jesus i'm an outlaw, killer and a thief
and i slow down only to sow my grief
i'm outlaw pete, i'm outlaw pete, can you hear me?
he cut his trail of tears across the countryside
and where he went women wept and men died
one night he awoke from a vision of his own death
saddled his pony and rode out deep into the west
married a navajo girl and settled down on the res.
and as the snow fell he held their beautiful daughter to his chest
i'm outlaw pete, i'm outlaw pete, can you hear me?
can you hear me? can you hear me?
out of the east on an irish stallion came bounty hunter dan
his heart quickened and burdened by the need to get his man
he found pete peacefully fishing by the river
pulled his gun and got the drop
he said ""pete you think you've changed but you have not""
he cocked his pistol pulled the trigger and shouted, ""let it start""
pete drew a knife from his boot, threw it,
and pierced dan through the heart
dan smiled as he lay in his own blood dying in the sun
whispered in pete's ear ""we cannot undo these things we've done""
you're outlaw pete, you're outlaw pete, can you hear me?
can you hear me? can you hear me?
for forty days & nights pete rode and did not stop
till he sat high upon an icy mountaintop
he watched a hawk on a desert updraft, slip & slide
moved to the edge and dug his spurs deep into his pony's side
some say pete and his pony vanished over the edge
and some say they remain frozen high up on that icy ledge
a young navajo girl washes in the river, her skin so fair
and braids a piece of pete's buckskin chaps into her hair
outlaw pete, outlaw pete, can you hear me?
can you hear me? can you hear me? can you hear me?
can you hear me? can you hear me?"
"it's over now, the thing we had
i ain't sorry, babe, i just feel mad

"i walk along the levee to see the gypsy man
the dirt 'neath my feet baby's turnin' to quicksand
he looked into my palm, then looked me in the eye
and told me you were gone, gone over the rise
once we stood together at the wishing well
our wishes like dreams, baby, into the water fell
oh then i kissed your lips but when i looked into your eyes
they were gone, gone over the rise
tonight the blackbirds fly low on the water's edge
oh we walked this path not knowing where it led
now at the bottom of the river deep lies something shiny and golden
is a promise that love couldn't keep same as a promise broken*
well i woke last night to the sound of rain
the wind rustling branches against the window pane
i searched the pillow beside me for the tears we cried
baby they were gone, gone over the rise"
"where the river runs to black
i take the schoolbooks from your pack
plastics, wire and your kiss
the breath of eternity on your lips

and i wait for paradise
and i wait for paradise
the virginia hills have gone to brown
another day, another sun goin' down
i visit you in another dream
i visit you in another dream
i reach and feel your hair
your smell lingers in the air
i brush your cheek with my fingertips
i taste the void upon your lips
and i wait for paradise
and i wait for paradise
i search for you on the other side
where the river runs clean and wide
up to my heart the waters rise
up to my heart the waters rise
i sink 'neath the river cool and clear

part man part monkey looks like to me
well the night is dark the moon is full
the flowers of romance exert their pull
we talk a while my fingers slip
i'm hard and cracking like a whip
well did god make man in a breath of holy fire
or did he crawl on up out of the muck and mire
well the man on the street

"it was christmas eve, i was standin' in the parking lot
of ""fabulous girls, nude   nude   nude""
in the car next to me there was a young lady givin' a blow job
to a man in a santa claus suit
his beard was crooked, his hat askew
embarrassed, i turned to go
when from the back seat of that mazda i heard somebody shout ""oh baby, don't
stop""
and a merry ""ho ho ho""
when i walked inside, i ordered a beer and a double shot of whisk
and in three minutes i had fallen in love
the dj announced ""ladies and gentlemen, from forth worth, texas: lady godiva""
and i sat and worshipped 'neath the angel above
at the end of her set she brushed her hair
came and sat on the stool to my right
and said ""will you buy me a drink?""
my heart beats fast, my trousers grew tight
and wittily i replied ""uhhh....""
she showed me a picture of her kid
said during the day she's an art student
she dances six nights a week for slobs and idiots like this
of course, present company excluded.
on donner, on dancer, on comet, on blitzen
i'm lost in the valley of the supervixens
worshippin' at the feet of the goddess above
i'm a pilgrim in the temple of love, ma, just a pilgrim in the temple
of love
well then santa came stumblin' in, and somebody shouted
""hey santa, where's your elves?""
he sat down on the stool to my left
and the bartender took a vodka bottle of the shelf
he asked if mrs. claus had called
to tell her he worked on the late shift at the mall
and he was sorry, but he just got through
i turned and i asked him:
""how's the kid this year, santa?""
beneath his breath he whispered ""a merry f*** you""
well then the owner come over and he was a short gfat ugly guy
with a funny kind of pushed in face
he shook my hand and said it was the first time
they'd ever had a real superstar in this place
lady godiva bought me a few drinks
and words came out of my mouth
what they were, i couldn't guess
but it was something about showgirls, lapdancing, motley crue
you can guess the rest
well i walked outside, snow was falling
i had some toys to put together   it was christmas time
santa followed me into the parking lot
and threw up on the hood of the car next to mine
i gave him my handkerchief, pulled out onto the highway
and as i sat at the light
i swear i saw a sleigh with a dozen of reindeers
pull up out of the parking lot and cut across the mall
and a voice shouted ""merry christmas to all you assholes
and to all a good f***ing night!"""
"you may think i'm fooling
for the foolish things i do
you may wonder how come i love you
when you get on my nerves like you do
well baby, you know you bug me
there ain't no secret about that
well come on over here and hug me
and, baby, i'll spill the facts
well, honey it ain't your money
cause baby i got plenty of that
i love you for your pink cadillac
crushed velvet seats
riding in the back, oozing down the street
waving to the girls
feeling out of sight
spending all my money on a saturday night
honey, i just wonder what you do there in back of your pink cadillac
pink cadillac
well now way back in the bible, temptations always come along
there's always somebody tempting you
somebody into doing something they know is wrong
well they tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold
and they tempt you with the pleasures that the flesh does surely hold
they say eve tempted adam with an apple
man i ain't going for that
i know it was her pink cadillac
crushed velvet seats
riding in the back, oozing down the street
waving to the girls
feeling out of sight
spending all my money on a saturday night
honey, i just wonder what you do there in back of your pink cadillac
now some folks say it's too big and uses too much gas
some folks say it's too old and that it goes too fast
but my love is bigger than a honda, it's bigger than a subaru
hey man there's only one thing and one car that will do
anyway we don't have to drive it honey, we can park it out in back
and have a party in your pink cadillac"
"that always end up point blank, shot between the eyes
point blank like little white lies you tell to ease the pain
you're walkin' in the sights, girl of point blank
and it's one false move and baby the lights go out
once i dreamed we were together again baby you and me
back home in those old clubs the way we used to be
we were standin' at the bar it was hard to hear
the band was playin' loud and you were shoutin' somethin' in my ear
you pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four
you grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor
you just stood there and held me, then you started dancin' slow
and as i pulled you tighter i swore i'd never let you go
well i saw you last night down on the avenue
your face was in the shadows but i knew that it was you
you were standin' in the doorway out of the rain
you didn't answer when i called out your name
you just turned, and then you looked away like just another stranger waitin' to get blown away
point blank, right between the eyes
point blank, right between the pretty lies you fell
point blank, shot right through the heart
yea point blank, you've been twisted up till you've become just another part of it
point blank, you're walkin' in the sights
point blank, livin' one false move just one false move away
point blank, they caught you in their sights
point blank, did you forget how to love, girl, did you forget how to fight
point blank they must have shot you in the head
cause point blank, bang bang baby you're dead"
"pony boy pony boy
won't you be my pony boy
giddy up giddy up giddy up whoo
my pony boy
ride with me ride with me
won't you take a ride with me
underneath the starry sky
my pony boy
o'er the hills and through the trees
we'll go ridin' you and me
giddy up giddy up giddy away
my pony boy
down into the valley deep
'neath the eaves we will sleep
sky of dreams up above

"and the black man releases his caddilac fangs
and your chech died in bed as the landlord thanks the young girl next door
for the rent
where telegraph wires are atached to your mind
delinquent daughters to their mothers still lie
papa stands on the corner ???waitin to beat the drum???
welcome home my prodigal son
when the telephone rings and falls of the hook
and your legs have been stolen by some defense department crook
and you startin' to think about writing a book
but now you won't pledge allingence to anything
and the maid comes in with coffee and cake
in a low cut dress she wore just for your sake
you explain your not dead and she takes it as a compliment
and sticks out her tounge and asks for requests
in a land were skyscrapers scrapes the sky
and delinquent daughters to their mothers still lie
papa stands on the corner ???waitin' to beat the drum???
welcome home my prodigal son"
"night after night
i keep holding on
you say you love me
then you leave me so lonely
baby i don't believe a word you're sayin'
i think it's all some evil game you're playin'
still all day long all i do is think about you
you got me believin' that i can't live without you
well if you want it, here's my confession
baby i can't help it, you're my obsession
protection, that's what i need
i need protection, baby, from your love
protection, that's what i need
i need protection, baby, from your love
i wait at home by the telephone
when i call your house, baby, you're not there
knock on the door and i rush down the stairs
when i open up, baby, you're not there
when we're together
when we're together and you put your arms around me
you keep my mind
forever, ever in doubt
you want me believin'
that, baby, i can't live without
protection, that's what i need
i need protection, baby, from your love
protection, that's what i need
i need protection, baby, from your love
we stand alone, at my window
and stare out, at the shadows down below
i feel your fingers on my face
i want to stay, i want to run away
protection, that's what i need
i need protection, baby, from your love
protection, that's what i need
i need protection, baby, from your love
protection

"don't you know that i danced, i danced till a quarter to three

"there's a wonderful world where all you desire
and everything you've longed for is at your fingertips
where the bittersweet taste of life is at your lips
where aisles and aisles of dreams await you
and the cool promise of ecstasy fills the air
at the end of each working day she's waiting there
i'm in love with the queen of the supermarket
as the evening sky turns blue
a dream awaits in aisle number two
with my shopping cart i move through the heart
of a sea of fools so blissfully unaware
that they're in the presence of something wonderful and rare
the way she moves behind the counter
beneath her white apron her secrets remain hers
as she bags the groceries, her eyes so bored
and sure she's unobserved
i'm in love with the queen of the supermarket
there's nothing i can say
each night i take my groceries and i drift away
and i drift away
with guidance from the gods above
at night i pray for the strength to tell the one i love
i love i love i love her so
i take my place in the checkout line
for one moment her eyes meet mine
and i'm lifted up, lifted up, lifted up, lifted up
i'm in love with the queen of the supermarket
though a company cap covers her hair
nothing can hide the beauty waiting there
the beauty waiting there
i'm in love with the queen of the supermarket
i'm in love with the queen of the supermarket
as i lift my groceries into my car
i turn back for a moment and catch a smile
that blows this whole f***ing place apart
i'm in love with the queen of the supermarket
i'm in love with the queen of the supermarket
i'm in love with the queen of the supermarket
i'm in love with the queen of the supermarket"
"i got a sixty nine chevy with a 396
fuelie heads and a hurst on the floor
she's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
outside the seven eleven store
me and my partner sonny built her straight out of scratch
and he rides with me from town to town
we only run for the money got no strings attatched
we shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down
tonight tonight the strip's just right
i wanna blow 'em off in my first heat
summer's here and the time is right
we're goin' racin' in the street
we take all the action we can meet
and we cover all the northeast state
when the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
from the fire roads to the interstate
some guys they just give up living
and start dying little by little piece by piece
some guys come home from work and wash up
then go rain' in the street
tonight tonight the strip's just right
i wanna blow 'em all out of their seats
calling out around the world
we're going racin' in the street
i met her on the strip three years ago
in a camaro with this dude from l.a.
i blew that camaro off my back and drove that little girl away
but now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes
and she cries herself to sleep at night
when i come home the house is dark
she sighs ""baby did you make it all right""
she sits on the porch of her daddy's house
but all her pretty dreams are torn
she stares off alone into the night
with the eyes of one who hates for just being born
for all the shut down strangers and hot rod angels
rumbling through this promised land
tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
and wash these sins off our hands
tonight tonight the highway's bright
out of our way mister you best keep
'cause summer's here and the time is right
we're goin' racin' in the street"
"radio nowhere
i was tryin' to find my way home

bouncing off a satellite
crushin' the last lone american night
this is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
this is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
i was spinnin' 'round a dead dial
just another lost number in a file
dancin' down a dark hole
just searchin' for a world with some soul

i want pounding drums
i want a million different voices speaking in tongues
this is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
this is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
is there anybody alive out there?
i was driving through the misty rain
searchin' for a mystery train
boppin' through the wild blue
tryin' to make a connection to you
this is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
this is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
is there anybody alive out there?

they come for the raw chance of a fair shake
some come to make damn sure, my friend

they come 'cause they can't stand the pain
of another long hot day of no rain

"i remember yesterday and i’d sit and watch the hound dogs play
howlin’ at the china moon
? ? now yesterday is the busted blues
life was young, things were easy,
days were short, nights were warm
time were good. hate was shallow
? ? the horse crazy behind the ? ? ? ?
i swear that i’ve seen your face somewhere back in that time
and i’m in theat place. do you remember?
the old house stood like world war two with just rooms
and a hall to be used.
the lady was mean.
just slightly unclean with a heart of cold silver and gold.
kitchen smelled of kerosene.
celing hung down on ? veil? and rotted beams
and the man, they said, his work could of hung in the room
now he sits around all day because his left arm won’t move
he was a master of the art of electricity
he lectured on tours and circuitry.
he was self employed, but he could never see his way into the light
he had a room full of switches and dials and lights and
a head full of clouds and eyes full of sight.
and when it got dark,
i could hear his heartbeat like a mother in the night.
she stood like a guardian ready to give everything up.
if i had asked for a sword and her blood in a cup.
but there was just time when i asked for too much.
she sighed because she could not give it.
we used to sit beneath the tree just the lady, the radio man and me.
and i think it was the winter of ’63 the man went away and let us be
it was early on an august day that the lady decided she must go away.
her heart it seems could not pay the price for what her body was buying
i came home from school and i found the note went into the kitcken
and lit the old stone with songs set on overload.
i turned on the tv, spent the rest of the sfternoon watching
all my cartoons thru the hall
and across the porch was the sun surrendered like a crying torch."

"remember when the music
came from wooden boxes
strung with silver wires
and as we sang
the words would set our hearts on fire
to believe in things
so we'd sing
remember when the music
brought us all together
to stand inside the rain
and as we'd join hands
we'd meet in the refrain
with dreams to live
and hope to give
remember when the music
was the best that we'd dream of
for our's children's time
and as we'd worked we'd sing
cause we knew time
was just a lie
a gift to say
a gift that future gave
remember when the music
was a rock we could cling to
so we would not despair
and as we sang we'd knew
we'd hear an echo in the air
and if we weren't smiling then
we'd smile again
and all the times i listened
and all the times i heard
and all the melodies i'm missing
and all the magic words
all the beautiful words
all the beautiful voices
and all the choices we had theni hope you find you got
those kind of choices once again
remember when the music
brought the night
across the valley
and as we hum the melody
we'd be safe within the sound
so we'd sleep
to awake with dreams
and promises to keep"

"she took off her stockings
i held 'em to my face
she had your ankles
i felt filled with grace
""two hundred dollars straight in
two fifty up the ass"" she smiled and said
she unbuckled my belt, pulled back her hair
and sat in front of me on the bed
she said, ""honey, how's that feel
do you want me to go slow?""
my eyes drifted out the window
and down to the road below
i felt my stomach tighten
as the sun bloodied the sky
and sliced through hotel blinds
i closed my eyes
sunlight on the amatitlan
sunlight streaming through your hair
in the valle de dos rios
the smell of mock orange filled the air
we rode with the vaqueros
down into cool rivers of green
i was sure the work and the smile coming out 'neath your hat
was all i'll ever need
somehow all you ever need's
never quite enough you know
you and i, maria, we learned it's so
she slipped me out of her mouth
""you're ready,"" she said
she took off her bra and panties
wet her fingers, slipped it inside her
and crawled over me on the bed
she bought me another whisky
said ""here's to the best you ever had""
we laughed and made a toast
it wasn't the best i ever had
not even close"
"wished we ran and lived as one
in another world my little one
where strange trees and dark rivers run
i told a dream to you
now outside the streets of pain
and the childhood games we play
have faded away
but my baby, she has restless nights
she has restless nights
my baby, she has restless nights
on late night movie screens
young lovers look so sure
lost in wide awake dreams
that they can't afford
once i held you in my arms
on a bed of stone
now we have grown 
well my baby she has restless nights
she has restless nights
my baby she has restless nights
wished we ran and lived as one
a different world my little one
where strange trees and dark rivers run
i told a dream to you
now outside the streets of pain
but here inside my heart
it all falls apart
but my baby, she has restless nights
she has restless nights
my baby, she has restless nights

on the road to my horizon
but i'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
like a rhinestone cowboy
getting cards and letters from people i don't even know
and offers comin' over the phone
well, i really don't mind the rain
and a smile can hide all the pain
but you're down when you're ridin' the train
that's takin' the long way
and i dream of the things i'll do
with a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
there'll be a load of compromisin'
on the road to my horizon
but i'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
rhinestone cowboy
gettin' cards and letters from people i don't even know
and offers comin' over the phone
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
rhinestone cowboy"

pocketful of pills and his brain on overload
seen some lights in his rearview mirror, panicked and gave her the gun

"we left the toys out in the yard
i took my wife and kids and left my home unguarded
we packed what we could into the car
no one here knows how it started
but suddenly everything was just so out of control
now i want some answers, mister, i need to know
i hear all the talk but i don't know what you're sayin'
but i think i got a good idea of the game that you're playin'
roulette, that's the name now
roulette, that's the game now
roulette, i don't believe what they're sayin'
roulette, and everybody's playin'
i grew up here on this street where nothin' moves, just a strange breeze
in a town full of worthless memories there's a shadow in my backyard
i've got a house full of things that i can't touch
well all those things they won't do me much good now
i was a fireman out at riker's, i did my job
mister, i've been cheated, i feel like i've been robbed
i'm the big expendable, my life's just canceled, null and void
but what are you gonna do about your new boy
roulette, you're playin' with my life
roulette, with my kids and my wife
roulette, every day the stakes get bigger
roulette, a different finger on the trigger
down by the river that talks the night speaks in searchlights
and shortwave radio squawk, the police patrol the streets
but i've left behind the man i used to be, everything he believed in and all that belonged to me
i tried to find my way out to somewhere where i thought it'd be safe
they stopped me at the roadblock they put up on the interstate
they put me in detention but i broke loose and then i ran
they said they want to ask me a few questions but i think they had other plans
now i don't know who to trust and i don't know what i can believe
they say they want to help me but with the stuff they keep on sayin'
i think those guys just wanna keep on playin'
roulette, with my life
roulette, with my kids and my wife
roulette, the bullet's in the chamber
roulette, who's the unlucky stranger
roulette, surprise, you're dead
roulette, the gun's to your head
roulette, the bullet's spinning in the chamber
roulette, pull the trigger, feel the click
no further danger"

i hold my tongue, i don't do much talking

well if something in the air feels a little unkind
don't worry darling, it'll slip your mind
i know you think you'd never be mine
well that's okay baby, i don't mind
that shy smile's sweet, that's a fact
go ahead, i don't mind the act

">from a tin roof top
the little boy did watch
the procession down through town
through the museum
where daniel walked with the devil
with them boys from the underground
where the giants of science
fight for tight control
over the wild lands of new mexico
sam houston's ghost's in texas
fighting for his soul
and the town folks rest uneasy
beneath the guns of kid cole
and the kid says: ""hey, where's santa ana
he who could romance the dumb into talking
take a chance with me tonight my contessa,
if it don't work out, i ain't lame, i can walk""
now some folks they just can't take it
to the streets of this town
but sam easily can, and he lays his money down
them cats in from the canyon
strut their stuff in town
but there's only secret sinners here
lord, there's only secret thieves
only a fool would try to save
what the desert chose to leave
and now, hey there senorita,
with your playboys in their spanish bandanas
french cream won't soften them bullets baby
french kisses will not break your heart
oh, painted night, set free with light
glows outside the rainbow saloon
match embraces with a spanish lady
beneath a graduation moon
no more colleges, no more coronations
some punk's idea of a teenage nation
has forced santa ana to change his stationfrom soldier to cartoon
and the giants of science
spend their days and nights
not with wives, not with lovers
but searching for the lights
they started in the desert on their helicopter flights
just to be lost in the dust and the night
ah, hey my contessa
in your juke joint rides
you always bring candy for the kids
come waltz with me tonight senorita
'cause only fools are alone on a night like this"

so keep me in your heart tonight and i'll save my love for you
so turn up your radio and darling dial me in close

if we open up our hearts, love won't forsake us

"i fell asleep on the couch last night, woke up with the tv on.
there was a woman in tight cotton exercise shorts
and a big plastic machine she was climbing on.
she said ""the abacycle guarantees ten inches off your waist,
and 50 pounds in just 3 minutes a day.""
i went to bed knowing the revolution had been postponed
and everything was ok.
you can buy it, you can try it, go right ahead.
but don't be fooled folks, there's only one.
i forget the guy's name but i know somebody must have said
sell it and they will come boys, sell it and they will come.
i switched the channels and there was evel knievel, i thought that he was
dead.
i found myself sitting there quietly, hanging on every word he said.
""now folks, the stimulator removes all pain from your life.
and the best day of your life will be when you try this little thing out.""
the camera moved in as he said, ""now let me tell you ladies and gentlemen,
pain is something old evel knows a little about""
you can buy it, you can try it, that's what i said.
but don't be fooled folks, there's only one.
i forget that guy's name but i know somebody must have said
sell it and they will come boys, sell it and they will come.
and a fellow comes on shouting ""free haircuts for life!"",
somehow you cut your hair with a vacuum cleaner.
and then i switched the channels and there was dionne warwick, communing
with her psychic friends.
i watched for hours, taking warmth, comfort,
and pleasure in the things that i despise.
touched by how much they needed me, and that gleeful desperation in their
eyes.
you can buy it, you can try it, it'll help you in bed.
but don't be fooled folks, there's only one.
i forget that guy's name but i know somebody said
sell it and they will come boys, sell it and they will come.
so dionne, cher, and all my late night friends, i drink to your health.
and tony little, america's personal trainer, please kill yourself.
now i've sold a few things myself in my time, and by the way folks,
there's some t shirts on your way outside.
well last night i dreamed of lipstick and tight little cotton shorts
""harder, faster"", she breathed.
""one, two, three, four, five""
ride, sally ride, girl, ride sally ride.
you can buy it, you can try it, it'll help you in bed.
but don't be fooled folks, there's only one.
i forget that guy's name but somebody said
sell it and they will come boys, sell it and they will come."

resting on your mainline
she's brutal as an ace
laid on the table at just the right time
she's like a devil woman
but she's locked in over drive
her eyes are cold stone
but she's backed by a power glide
she's sweet, she's educated
she knows about history, geometry
she's so fine
oh she says i ain't got the love
i ain't got the time
ain't gonna give you no kiss
ain't gonna hand ya
all i want's a ride, sweet william
all i want's a ride
and it's oh baby, oh baby
won't you come, don't you wanna go for a ride?
i'll get in my car and burn it up
now switch on the radio and turn it up
and we're gonna be burning down a straight load
i want some love and i got to truck along
well she's vicious as a razor
resting on your mainline
she's brutal as an ace
laid on the table at just the right time
she's like a devil woman
but she's locked in over drive
her eyes are cold stone

she's so educated
she's got a nice mama, she got a nice pop

some kids call her god down on lover's lane
be my baby
won't you be my lover
come on baby
i said hey baby"
"with her killer graces and her secret places
that no boy can fill with her hands on her hips
oh and that smile on her lips
because she knows that it kills me
with her soft french cream
standing in that doorway like a dream
i wish she'd just leave me alone
because french cream won't soften them boots
and french kisses will not break that heart of stone
with her long hair falling
and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
oh o she's the one, she's the one
that thunder in your heart
at night when you're kneeling in the dark
it says you're never gonna leave her
but there's this angel in her eyes
that tells such desperate lies
and all you want to do is believe her
and tonight you'll try just one more time
to leave it all behind and to break on through
oh she can take you, but if she wants to break you
she's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
and no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run
oh o she's the one, she's the one
oh o and just one kiss
she'd fill them long summer nights
with her tenderness that secret pact you made
back when her love could save you from the bitterness
oh she's the one, oh she's the one
oh she's the one, oh she's the one
oh she's the one, oh she's the one"

"the runway rushed up at him, as he felt the wheels touch down
he stood out on the blacktop, and took a taxi into town.
he got off down on main street, and went into a local bar
bought a drink and found a seat in the corner in the dark
she called up her mama to make sure the kids were outa' the house
she checked herself out in the dining room mirror,
and undid an extra button on her blouse
he felt her lyin' next to him and the clock said 4 am
he was starin' at the ceilin' he couldn't move his hands
: oh mama, mama, mama come quick, i've got the shakes and
i'm gonna be sick, throw your arms around me in the cold dark night,
hey now mama don't shut out the light, don't you shut out the light,....

bobby pulled his ford outa' the garage and they polished up the chrome
his mama said johnny oh johnny, i'm so glad to have you back with me
his pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back at the renderin' factory
well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain
beyond a stretch of maryland pines there's a river without a name

"a mother dies, leaving her young son to come to terms with the loss. in remembrance of fiona chappel, for her sons tyler and oliver.
i was barely 13 years old
she came out of the guadalupe's on a night so cold
her coat was frosted diamonds in the sallow moon's glow
my silver palomino
sixteen hands from her withers to the ground
i lie in bed and listen to the sound
of the west texas thunder roll
my silver palomino
i track her into the mountains she loved
watch her from the rocks above
she'd dip her neck and drink from the winter flows
my silver palomino
our mustaneros were the very best, sir
but they could never lay a rope on her
no corral will ever hold
the silver palomino
in my dreams bareback i ride
over the pradera low and wide
as the wind sweeps out the draw
'cross the scrub desert floor
i'd give my riata and spurs
if i could be forever yours
i'd ride into the serrania where no one goes
for my silver palomino
summer drought come hard that year
our herd grazed the land so bare
me and my dad had to blowtorch the thorns off the prickly pear
and mother, your hand slipped from my hair
tonight i wake early the sky is pearl, the stars aglow
i saddle up my red roan
i ride deep into the mountains along a ridge of pale stone
where the air is still with the coming snow
as i rise higher i can smell your hair
the scent of your skin, mother, fills the air
'midst the harsh scrub pine that grows
i watch the silver palomino
mustaneros: mustangers
pradera: prairie
riata: rope
serrania: sierra
prickly pear: cactus"
"miguel came from a small town in northern mexico
he came north with his brother luis to california three years ago
they crossed at the river levee when luis was just 16
and found work together in the fields of the san joaquin
they left their friends and family
their father said ""my sons one thing you will learn
for everything the north gives it exacts a price in return.
""they worked side by side in the orchards
from morning till the day was thru
doing the work the hueros wouldn't
word was out some men in from sinaloa were looking for some hands
well deep in fresno county there was a deserted chicken ranch
there was a small tin shack on the edge of a ravine
miguel and luis stood cooking methamphetamine
you could spend a year in the orchards
or make half as much in one ten hour shift
working for the men from sinaloa
but if you slipped the hydriodic acid
could burn right thru your skin
they'd leave you spittin' up blood in the desert
if you breathed those fumes in
it was early one winter evening as miguel stood watch outside
when the shack exploded lighting up the valley night
miguel carried luis' body over his shoulder down a swale
to the creekside and there in the tall grass luis rosales died
miguel lifted luis' body into his truck and then he drove
to where the morning sunlight fell on a eucalyptus grove
there in the dirt he dug up 10000 dollars all that they'd saved
kissed his brother's lips and placed him in his grave"

when the clock strikes five
as the red sun sets in the ocean, i start to come alive
summer girls in the parking lot slap on their makeup
and they flirt the night away

joe came home in '45 and took out a g. i. loan
on a sleepy little spot an army cook could call his own
he married may, the highway come in

they were sitting on top of a pretty little gold mine

"i'm riding down kingsley,
figuring i'll get a drink
turn the radio up loud,
so i don't have to think,
i take her to the floor,
looking for a moment when the world seems right,
and i tear into the guts,
of something in the night.
you're born with nothing,
and better off that way,
soon as you've got something the send
someone to try and take it away,
you can ride this road 'till dawn,
without another human being in sight,
just kids wasted on
something in the night.
nothing is forgotten or forgiven,
when it's your last time around,
i got stuff running around 'round my head
that i just can't live down
when we found the things we loved,
they were crushed and dying in the dirt.
we tried to pick up the pieces,
and get away without getting hurt,
but they caught us at the state line,
and burned our cars in one last fight,
and left us running burned and blind,
chasing something in the night."
"came into town with a pocketful of songs
i made the rounds
but i didn't last long
now i'm out on this highway
with a bone cold chill
somewhere north of nashville
i lie awake in the middle of the night
makin' a list of things that i didn't do right
with you at the top of a long page filled
here, somewhere north of nashville
for the deal i made, the price was strong
i traded you for this song
we woke each morning with hearts filled
bluebird of love on the windowsill
now the heart's unsteady, and the night is still
all i've got's this melody, and time to kill

them black blind poet generals and restless loud white boys
but time's grew thin and the axis grew somehow incomplete
where instead of child lions we had aging junkie sheep
well how many wasted
have i seen signed ""hollywood or bust""
and left to ride the ever ghostly arizona gusts
cheerleader tramps and kids
with big amps sounding in the void
high society vamps, ex heavyweight champs
mistaking soot for soil
so break me now big mama as old faithful breaks the day
believe me my good linda, the aurora will shine the way
the confederacy's in my name now
the hounds are held at bay
the axis needs a stronger arm
do you feel your muscles play
well the doorstep blanket weaver, madonna pushes bells
from house to house i see her
giving last kisses and wishing well
to every gypsy mystic hero that the kids might find a place
who get lost forever mothers and fathers
on their weekends out in space
well sons they search for fathers, but the fathers are all gone
the lost souls search for saviors, but saviors don't last long
those aimless questless renegade brats
who live their lives in song
they run the length of a candle
in a goodnight whisper and they're gone
so break me now big mama as old faithful breaks the day
believe me my good linda, the aurora will shine the way
the confederacy's in my name now
the hounds are held at bay
the axis needs a stronger arm, do you feel your muscles play
yeah!
well the missions are filled with hermits
they're looking for a friend
the terraces are filled with cat men just looking for a way in
those orphans jumped on silver mountains
lost in celestial alleyways
they wait for that old tramp dog man moses
he takes in all the strays
now don't you grow on empty legends or lonely cradle songs
billy the kid was just a bowery boy
who made a living twirling his guns
the night she's long and lanky
and she speaks in a mother tongue
she lullabies the refugees with amplifier's hum

believe me my good linda, the aurora will shine the way
the confederacy's in my name now
the hounds are held at bay

i'll be your gypsy joker your shotgun rider
baby let me be your soul driver
well now no one knows which way love's wheel turns
we may get rich or crash and burn
this fortune weight or just the black hand of fate
this love rushes over us and its ghostly voice
if the angels are unkind or if the seasons are dark
or if in the air love just falls apart
well then here's to our destruction
baby let me be your soul driver
yea here's to our destruction
baby let me be your soul driver"

this is a prayer for the souls of the departed

all i can think of is what if it would've been him instead
i want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it down

where you get paid and your silence passes as honor
and all the hatred and dirty little lies
been written off the books and into decent men's eyes"

mama dreamed of paris nights
and boatin' on the seine
she said, we're gonna make it there too

dressed like a painting of lautrec's
in the night she'd clutch me to her breast

strut so fine down the eiffel mall
it's a southern one i sing my songs for
well with the local bunch of do good boys
and an old man from the west
we crossed the land in the caravan
yes we traveled with the best
with circus acts and vaudeville hacks
and the mississippi delta queen

in an alley in new orleans

with the blood of great cowboys

janey held her son down at the riverside
waist deep in water how bright the sun shone

went to a drawer in her bureau and got out her old engagement ring

in a little house out on the edge of town
we got married, and swore we'd never part

she asked if i remembered the letters i wrote
when our love was young and bold
she said last night she read those letters
and they made her feel one hundred years old
and i'm driving a stolen car
on a pitch black night
and i'm telling myself i'm gonna be alright
but i ride by night and i travel in fear
that in this darkness i will disappear"

you said those were only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
i pulled my collar to the wind and spit them on the ground
you said those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
sat on the edge of our bed in the sun
i felt them gather on my tongue
i woke up this morning with stones in my mouth
you said those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
the dirt brown winter field
a thousand black crows cover the ground
you say those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
the autumn wind blows through the trees
as the dark leaves come tumbling down
you say those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
i walk a highway washed in sun
i feel weight gather on my tongue

"got out of prison back in '86 and i found a wife
walked the clean and narrowjust tryin' to stay out and stay alive
got a job at the rendering plant, it ain't gonna make me rich
in the darkness before dinner comes
sometimes i can feel the itch
i got a cold mind to go tripping across that thin line
i'm sick of doin' straight time
my uncle's at the evenin' table, makes his living runnin' hot cars
slips me a hundred dollar bill says
""charlie you best remember who your friends are.

mary's smiling but she's watching me out of the corner of her eye
seems you can't get any more than half free
i step out onto the front porch and suck the cold air deep inside of me
got a cold mind to go trippin' 'cross that thin line
i'm sick of doin' straight time
in the basement huntin' gun and a hacksaw
sip a beer and thirteen inches of barrel drop to the floor
come home in the evening, can't get the smell from my hands
lay my head down on the pillow
and go driftin' off into foreign lands"
"in the tall grass we held hands
down by the river we made plans
of what would and would not be
it was impossible to see
their black boots shone in the sun
they were waiting on the annandale train
when my baby come
little girl with the long black hair
do you know what lies 'neath the long coats that they wear
once i swore you'd ride with me
down where this river meets the sea
over these dark hills i'd walk along
to lie with you on a bed of stone
river blood red with the years
you can flood this valley with a thousand tears
wash away all that's been found
but you'll never wash away the sound
of the stray bullet that shot my baby down
of the stray bullet that shot my baby down
of the stray bullet that shot my baby down
of the stray bullet that shot my baby down"

she rides around in a cut down chevy machine.

and you can always tell a moment she's around,
you can hear the loud engine roaring.
she says, ""come on, get in. hey baby, you want to go for a ride?""
i know she sets your mind soaring.
oh and the boys, they jump back,
as that engine unwinds.
i'm glued to my seat, mama,
as i watch that speed o meter climb.
oh she moves so fast she's almost obscene.

streets of fire
i'm wandering, a loser down these tracks
i'm dying, but girl i can't go back
'cause in the darkness i hear somebody call my name
and when you realize how they tricked you this time
and it's all lies but i'm strung out on the wire

i walk with angels that have no place

"well they built the titanic to be one of a kind, but many ships have ruled the seas
they built the eiffel tower to stand alone, but they could build another if they please
taj mahal, the pyramids of egypt, are unique i suppose
but when they built you, brother, they broke the mold
now the world is filled with many wonders under the passing sun
and sometimes something comes along and you know it's for sure the only one
the mona lisa, the david, the sistine chapel, jesus, mary, and joe
and when they built you, brother, they broke the mold
when they built you, brother, they turned dust into gold
when they built you, brother, they broke the mold
they say you can't take it with you, but i think that they're wrong
'cause all i know is i woke up this morning, and something big was gone
gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold
just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold
now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth
and i know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and cursed
but love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told
and when she built you, brother, she broke the mold
that attitude's a power stronger than death, alive and burning her stone cold

"the angel rides with hunch backed children, poison oozing from his engine
wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven
baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked
the roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires strokes his precious pavement
the interstate's choked with nomadic hordes in volkswagen vans with full running boards dragging great anchors
followin' dead end signs into the sores
the angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore
madison avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain
she rubs against the weather beaten frame and asks the angel for his name
off in the distance the marble dome reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown
the woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones"
"the architect angel held <?> juda ranch.
just a dirty mile down on the borderline.
where he mastered blastin' and hustled young cattle for slaughter
and dated juda's daughter.
from the cellar aways to the attics and all across the plains
broke electric static of religious strain,
and though he was never an addict, he wore scars on his veins.
like a young girl holds her first pimp, he held his bible in.
from desert bars and church bazaars, the hunger slowly came
with vulgar faces from vulgar places lookin' for a game.
well, ivory gun handles and chamber grease
and souped up hydroplanes.
the bullets burn from tv silver, bearin' great cowboys' names.
now with 14 inches of gun barrel, smokin' from the lid,
spurs on straight black bootheels, he said ""they call me the brooklyn kid.""
and in his lonely zenith nightmares, well that's just what they did.
oh, how he played out his scenes, loaded on <?> dreams.
well, his holster slung low like a hot kid sister
tied back to his leg like he gonna do.
he was stompin' the step he called the quickman twister.
his six guns were pumpin' through.
his tongue hung low like sawdust scrapin' across the plains.
he crawled up outside the juda ranch.
and started callin' the angel names.
and now the architect angel stood, in one hand a staff, the other a gun.
he held the staff high in the wind. the gun was like a piece in the sun.
he started howlin' like a monsoon wind. drew fast. the job was done.
at night the moon stretched tight light 'cross the plains,
as real cowboys sat around real campfire flames,
and the county wolf called as if to explain to his son
the way the west was won.
the west was finally won.
the way the west was won."

and love, they have a way of slipping into blackness
uncared for of slipping away

in the twelfth, i slipped my tounge over my broken jaw
i stood over him and i pounded his bloody body into the floor
well the bell rang and rang and still i kept on
'til i felt my glove leather slip 'tween his skin and bone
then the women and the money came fast and the days i lost track
the women red, the money green, but the numbers were black
i fought for the men in their silk suits to lay down their bets
well i took my good share, ma, i have no regrets
i took the fix at the state armory with big john mcdowell
from high in the rafters i watched myself fall
as they raised his arm my stomach twisted and the sky it went black
i stuffed my bag with their good money and i never looked back
understand, in the end, ma, every man plays the game
if you know me one different then speak out his name
ma, if my voice now you don't recognize
then just open the door and look into your dark eyes
i ask of you nothin', not a kiss not a smile,
just open the door and let me lie down for a while
now the gray rain's fallin' and my ring fightin's done
so in the work fields and alleys i take all who'll come
if you're a better man than me then just step to the line
show me your money and speak out your crime
now there's nothin' i want, ma, nothin' that you need say
just let me lie down for a while and i'll be on my way
tonight in the shipyard a man draws a circle in the dirt
i move to the center and i take off my shirt
i study him for the cuts, the scars, the pain,
man, nor time can erase
i move hard to the left and i strike to the face"
"two kids get married, same old thing
folks congratulate you, church bells ring
who's got the ring, who's gonna pay the priest
get your name in the paper, picture or two at least
and at the reception all the old records play
""where you gonna live, are you gonna take her away?""
in a corner my new nephew's showin' me his knife
you swore that you'd love her for the rest of your life
went to kiss you at the altar we bumped heads
honeymoon night we figured we best shake on it instead
dressed kinda funny, laughin' we hop in bed
you can wear it on your feet, you can wear it on your head
come mornin' my new family's sitting on the front porch swing
smilin' kinda funny, nobody says a thing
my new brother in law's throwin' a football, he tosses me a pass
we all sit down on the front stoop, everybody happy at last"
"sleepy town ain't got the guts to budge
baby this emptiness has already been judged
i wanna go out tonight, i wanna find out what i got
you're a strange part of me you're a preacher's girl
and i don't want no piece of this mechanical world
got my arms open wide and my blood is running hot
we'll take the midnight road right to the devil's door
and even the white angels of eden with their flaming swords
won't be able to stop us from hitting town in this dirty old ford
well it don't take no nerve when you got nothing to guard
i got tombstone in my eyes and i'm running real hard
my baby was a lover and the world just blew her away
once they tried to steal my heart, beat it right out of my head
well baby they didn't know that i was born dead
i am the iceman, fighting for the right to live
i say better than the glory roads of heaven
better off riding hell bound in the dirt
better than bright line of the freeway
better than the shadows of your daddy's church
better than the hands of waiting baby better off is the search"
"sundown, sundown
they're taking all the tents down
where have you gone my handsome billy?
sundown, sundown
the carnival train's leaving town
where are you now darling billy?
we won't be dancing together on the high wire
facing the lions with you at my side anymore
we won't be breathin' the smoke and the fire
on a midway
hanging from the trapeze
my wrists waiting for your wrists
two daredevils high up on the wall of death
you throwin' the knife that lands inches from my heart
sundown
moonrise, moonrise
the light that was in your eyes has gone away
daybreak, daybreak
the thing in you that made me ache has gone to stay
we'll be riding the train without you tonight
the train that keeps on movin'
its black smoke scorching the evening sky
a millions stars shining above us like every soul livin' and dead
has been gathered together by a god to sing a hymn over your bones
sun down, sun down
empty are the fairgrounds
where are you now handsome billy?"
"i got my discharge from fort irwin
took a place on the san diego county line
felt funny bein' a civilian again
it'd be some time
my wife had died a year ago
i was still tryin' to find my way back whole
went to work for the ins on the line
with the california border patrol
bobby ramirez was a ten year veteran
we became friends
his family was from
guanajuato
so the job it was different for him
he said ""they risk death in the deserts and mountains
pay all they got to the smugglers rings
we send 'em home and they come right back again
carl hunger is a powerful thing.""
well i was good at doin' what i was to
l'd kept my uniform pressed and clean
at night i chased their shadows
thru the arroyos and ravines
drug runners farmers with their families
young women with little children by their sides
come night we'd wait out in the canyons
and try to keep 'em from crossin' the line
well the first time that i saw her
she was in the holdin' pen
our eyes met and she looked away
then she looked back again
her hair was black as coal
her eyes reminded me of what i'd lost
she had a young child cryin' in her arms
i asked ""senora is there anything i can do?""
there's a bar in tijuana
where me and bobby drink alongside
the same people we'd sent back the day before
she said her name was louisa
she was from sonora and had just come north
we danced and i held her in my arms
and i knew what i would do
she said she had some family in madera county
if she her child and younger brother could just get thru
at night they come across the levee
in the searchlight's dusty glow
we'd rush 'em in our broncos
force 'em back down into the river below
she climbed into my truck
she leaned toward me and we kissed
as we drove her brother's shirt slipped open
and i saw the tape across his chest
we were just about on the highway
when bobby's jeep come up in the dust on my right
i pulled over and let my engine run
and stepped out into his lights
i felt myself movin'
my gun restin' 'neath my hand
we stood there starin' at each other
as off thru the arroyo she ran
bobby ramirez he never said nothin'
6 months later i left the line
i drifted to the central valley
and took what work i could find
at night i searched the local bars
and the migrant towns
lookin' for my louisa
with the black hair fallin' down"
"the way she kisses so tenderly
the way she gives her love to me
i been felt by the graces and angels up above
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
that make me love her
the way she sighs when i hold her tight
good times and bad will be alright
faces on the street they push hard and they shove
disappear with the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
i know i love her
the soft summer breeze fills her every sigh
her eyes are bluer than the summer sky
i been felt by the graces and angels up above
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
that make me love her
and when the night closes in
i'm drifting and i can't find a friend
on the wings of the angels i'm saved by her love
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
that make me love her
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does
the little things my baby does"
"my soul went walkin' but i stayed here
feel like i been workin' for a thousand years
chippin' away at this chain of my own lies
climbin' a wall a hundred thousand miles high
well i woke up this morning on the other side
yeah yeah this is the long goodbye
hey yeah this is the long goodbye
same old faces it's the same old town
what once was laughs is draggin' me now
wailin' on rain hangin' on for love
words of forgiveness from some god above
ain't no words of mercy comin' from on high
oh no just a long goodbye
yeah yeah just one long goodbye
well i went to leave twenty years ago
since then i guess i been packin' kinda slow
sure did like that admirin' touch
guess i like'd it a little too much
the moon is high and here i am
sittin' here with this hammer in hand
one more drink oughta ease the pain
starin' at that last link in the chain
well let's raise our glass and let this hammer fly
hey yeah this is the long goodbye
hey yeah this is the long goodbye"
"last night i went to the coronado
i bought my ticket and i found my seat
it was a new adventure straight from hollywood
lights went down as i felt the heat
they went tearing from the final scene
burning rubber, spilling gasoline
as the credits rolled away
they were still chasing the man who got away
well, every night for weeks and weeks now
i beat the traffic, i beat the heat now
for two hours i can believe now
the man who got away was me
i went tearing from the final scene
burning rubber, spilling gasoline
as the credits rolled away
they were still chasing the man who got away
drove into stockton, my radio went dead
that's when i heard what the newsman said
said, ""armed robbery on the ten hundred block
was two men involved and one man shot
well, while his accomplice made the payday
with a 45 he blew the cashier away way
last seen headed on the state highway
driving a late model chevrolet
i went screaming from the final scene
in a hail of bullets and flaming gasoline
as the credits rolled away
they were still chasing the man who got away
man that got away
man that got away
man that got away
whoa!"
"he rode the rails since the great depression
fifty years out on the skids
he said 'you don't cross nobody
you'll be all right out here kid.'
left my family in pennsylvania
searchin' for work i hit the road
i met frank in east texas
in a freight yard blown thru with snow
from new mexico to colorado california to the sea
frank he showed me the ropes sir=20
just till i could get back on my feet
i hoed sugar beets outside of firebaugh i picked the peaches from the
marysville trees
they bunked us in a barn just like animals
me and a hundred others just like me
we split up come the springtime
i never seen frank again
'cept one rainy night he blew by me on a grainer
shouted my name and disappeared in the rain and wind
they found him shot dead outside of stockton
his body lyin' on a muddy hill
nothin' taken nothin' stolen
somebody killin' just to kill
late that summer was rollin' thru the plains of texas
a vision passed before my eyes
a small house sittin' trackside
with the glow of the savior's beautiful light
a woman stood cookin' in the kitchen
kid sat at a table with his old man
now i wonder does my son miss me
does he wonder where i am
tonight i pick my campsite carefully
outside the sacramento yard
gather some wood and light a fire
in the early winter dark
wind whistling cold i pull my coat around me
heat some coffee and stare out into the black night
i lie awake i lie awake sir
with my machete by my side
my jesus your gracious love and mercy
tonight i'm sorry could not fill my heart
like one good rifle
and the name of who i ought to kill"
"meet me afternoon 'neath the summer sun
right by the lake till the evening comes
i run my fingers through your sun streaked hair
baby that's the power of prayer
summer nights, summer's in the air
i stack the tables with the chairs
as close and tight when you're standing there
baby that's the power of prayer
it's a fixed game without any rules
an empty table on a ship of fools
i'm holding hearts, i play the pair
darling it's just the power of prayer
it's a fixed game without any rules
an empty table on a ship of fools
i'm holding hearts, i play the pair
i'm going all in 'cause i don't care
they say that love it comes and goes
but darling what, what do they know
i'm reaching for heaven, we'll make it there
darling it's just the power of prayer
baby it's just the power of prayer
darling it's just the power of prayer
last call, the bouncer shuts the door
this magic moment drifts across the floor
as ben e. king's voice fills the air
baby that's the power of prayer"
"you make up your mind, you choose the chance you take
you ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks
out on to an open road you ride until the day
you learn to sleep at night with the price you pay
now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies
and in one last breath they built the roads they'd ride to their death
driving on through the night, unable to break away
from the restless pull of the price you pay
oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay
now you can't walk away from the price you pay
now they'd come so far and they'd waited so long
just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong
where the dark of night holds back the light of day
and you've gotta stand and fight for the price you pay
little girl down on the strand
with that pretty little baby in your hands
do you remember the story of the promised land
how he crossed the desert sands
and could not enter the chosen land
on the banks of the river he stayed
to face the price you pay
so let the games start, you better run you little wild heart
you can run through all the nights and all the days
but just across the county line, a stranger passing through put up a sign
that counts the men fallen away to the price you pay,
and girl before the end of the day,
i'm gonna tear it down and throw it away"

i followed that dream
just like those guys do way up on the screen
drove a chopped up challenger
down route 9
through the dead ends and all the bad scenes
and when the promise was broken
i cashed in a few of my dream
well, i built that challenger by myself

thunder road ...
there's something dying out on the highway tonight

oh but somehow i paid the big cost
inside i felt like i was carrying
the broken spirits of all the other ones who lost
when the promise is broken you go on living
but man it takes something from down in your soul
like when the truth is spoken, it don't make no
difference
finally something in your heart turns cold
yeah i followed that dream, me and some guysin the dead ends and all the
two bit bars
the night the promise was broken
i was drunk and far away from home,
sleeping with a stranger
in the back seat of a borrowed car
thunder road ...
here's one for the lost lovers and all the fixed games

this poem that i wrote for you
this black stone and these hard tears
are all i've got left now of you
i remember you in your marine uniform laughing
laughing that you're shipping out probably
i read robert mcnamara says he's sorry
you and your boots and black t shirt
ah billy you looked so bad
ya, you and your rock and roll band
was the best thing this shit town ever had
now the man who put you here
he feeds his family in rich dining halls
and apology and forgiveness have no place here at all
at the wall
i'm sorry i missed you last year
i couldn't find no one to drive me
if your eyes could cut through that black stone
tell me would they recognize me?
for the living, time must be served
life goes on
cigarettes and a bottle of beer
skin on black stone
high school pictures, paper flowers
ribbon, red as the blood
ya, as the blood you spilled
in the central highlands mud
now the limousines rush down pennsylvania boulevard
as the rain falls
and apology and forgiveness have no place here at all"

the way you sigh when we kiss goodnight

the way you warm me baby when i'm cold

the way the rivers run to the sea
well hey, that's the way you belong to me
the way you soothe me when i'm in pain
the way you make the blood rush in my veins
the way the winds rush through the trees

the way you make me feel like i'm a man
the way the sun belongs to the sea
well hey, that's the way you belong to me
the way you make me feel like i belong
and if i could girl though i know it'd be wrong
i'd lock you deep inside
'till the last rains fall
and hide you from the emptiness of it all
sometimes at night i lie awake
i pull you close and feel each breath you take

i'm a wayfarer, baby, i drift from town to town
when everyone's asleep and the midnight bells sound
my wheels are hissin' up the highway
spinning 'round and 'round
you start out slow in a sweet little bungalow
something two can call home
then rain comes fallin', the blues come calling
and you're left with a heart of stone
some folks are inspired sitting by the fire
slippers tucked under the bed
but when i go to sleep i can't count sheep
for the white lines in my head
i'm a wayfarer, baby, i roam from town to town
when everyone's asleep and the midnight bells sound
my wheels are hissin' up the highway

"dirty old street, all slushed up in the rain and snow.
little boy and his ma,
standin' outside a run down music store window.
on top of the christmas tree shines one beautiful star,
and lyin' underneath, a brand new japanese guitar.
i remember in the mornin' ma, hearin' your alarm clock ring.
i'd lie awake and listen to you gettin' ready for work,
the sound of your makeup case on the sink.
and the ladies at the office, all silk stockin's and rustlin' skirts.
and how proud and happy you always looked, walkin' home from work.
well if pa's eyes were windows, into a world so deadly and true,
you couldn't stop me from lookin', but you kept me from crawlin' through.
well it's a funny old world ma,
where a little boy's wishes come true.
well i got a few in my pocket, and a special one just for you.
it ain't no phone call on sunday, flowers, or a mother's day card.
it ain't no house on the hill, with a garden and a nice little yard.
i got my hot rod down on bond street,
i'm older but you'll know me at a glance.
we'll find us a rock 'n roll bar, baby we'll go out and dance.
well it was me in my beatle boots, you in pink curlers and matador pants,
gettin' up in the livin' room, to do the twist for my uncles and aunts.
well i got a girl of my own now ma,
yeah, we're doin' ok.
and i've been workin' up the nerve, to say what it is i got to say.
last night we sat around laughin', at all those things that guitar brought
us,
and i laid awake thinkin' about the other things it's brought.
well tonight i'm takin's requests here in the kitchen,
this one's for you, let me come right out and say,
that if you're lookin' for a sad song, well, i'm not gonna play"

but i never heard the word on you
your love was like a machine gun
i wore your bugle in my belt
and i was your kid glove lover
all the cards were yours
you always dealt
and i stood before your soapbox
noiseless and shoeless
playing my pantry boy's games
you had your hands raised up to the sky
shouting oh sunday deity
oh big daddy longlegs
come down and bless your sister please
you were shoutin' orders about the construction
going on down the highway
you were namin' names, blamin' blames
and you blamed me
you wore your heart like a challenge
far and apart for anyone who came
open and wide like the river
with rocks on both sides to keep the water tame
but i heard the word on your high tides
and i felt the pain when i tried
to rip your flood gates wide
and pull your body on over to my side
where we both could hide
but you heard about the freedom ride
and you heard about the highway crew
who could cut the light a little bit faster than you
so you left me just your shoes
and i hear the word on jesus
and i hear the word on his marching troop
and i hear the word on the country
but i never heard the word on you"

i display
have you ever seen a one legged man
trying to dance his way free?
if you've ever seen a one legged man
then you've seen me"
"she walked up to me and asked me if i wanted to dance
she looked kind of fine, so i thought that i might just take that chance
and when we danced she held me tight
when i walked her home that night
we stood beneath the moon so bright
and she kissed me
the first time i saw her i knew i had to see her again
i knew we was gonna be so much more than just friends
i didn't know just what to do so i whispered i love you
she said that she loved me too
and she kissed me
she kissed me in a way i've never been kissed before
she kissed me in a way i wanna be kissed forevermore
i knew that she was mine so i gave her all the love that i had
but i ain't the kinda guy she could take home to meet her dad
run with me and i'll make you my bride
she was so happy that she almost cried
then i pulled her by my side
and she kissed me
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
she walked up to me and asked me if i wanted to dance

i said run with me and i'll make you my bride

"hey there mister can you tell me what happened to the seeds i've sown
can you give me a reason sir as to why they've never grown
they've just blown around from town to town
till they're back out on these fields
where they fall from my hand
back into the dirt of this hard land
now me and my sister from germantown
we did ride
we made our bed sir from the rock on the mountainside
we been blowin' around from town to town
lookin for a place to stand
where the sun burst through the cloud
to fall like a circle
like a circle of fire down on this hard land
now even the rain it don't come 'round
it don't come 'round here no more
and the only sound at night's the wind
slammin' the back porch door
it just stirs you up like it wants to blow you down
twistin' and churnin' up the sand
leavin' all them scarecrows lyin' face down
face down in the dirt of this hard land
from a building up on the hill
i can hear a tape deck blastin' ""home on the range""
i can see them bar m choppers
sweepin' low across the plains
it's me and you frank we're lookin' for lost cattle
our hooves twistin' and churnin' up the sand
we're ridin' in the whirlwind searchin' for lost treasure
way down south of the rio grande
we're ridin' cross that river
in the moonlight
up onto the banks of this hard land
hey frank won't ya pack your bags
and meet me tonight down at liberty hall
just one kiss from you my brother
and we'll ride until we fall
well sleep in the fields
we'll sleep by the rivers and in the morning
we'll make a plan
we'll if you can't make it
stay hard, stay hungry, stay alive
if you can
and meet me in a dream of this hard land"

the sword of our fathers with lessons hard taught
the shield strong and sturdy from battles well fought
this is your sword, this is your shield
this is the power of love revealed
carry them with you wherever you go
and give all the love that you have in your soul
at times there are dark, dark must cover the earth
this world? s filled with the beauty of god? s work

and give all the love that you have in your soul
in the days of despair you can grow hard
? til you close your mind and empty your heart
if you find yourself staring in the abyss
hold tight to your loved ones and remember this
this shield will protect your secret heart
the sword will defend from what comes in the dark
should you grow weary on the battlefield
well do no despair, our love is real
this is your sword, this is your shield
this is the power of love revealed

"well i rode that ribbon highway
i saw above me the endless sky
i saw below me the golden valley
this land was made for you and me
i've roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
and all around me a voice was calling
this land was made for you and me
this land is your land
this land is my land
from california
to the new york island
from the redwood forest
to the gulf stream waters
this land was made for you and me
well the sun came shining and i was strolling
through wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
and a voice was sounding
as the fog was lifting
saying this land was made for you and me
this land is your land
this land is my land
from california
to the new york island
from the redwood forest
to the gulf stream waters
this land was made for you and me"

a billion years or just this night
either way it'll be all right
a blackness then the light of a million stars
as you slip into my car the evening sky strikes sparks
this life, this life and then the next
with you i have been blessed, what more can you expect
at night at my telescope alone
this emptiness i've roamed
searching for a home
the stars a brief string of shining charms
rushing in red out of our arms into the drifting dark
this life, this life and then the next
with you i have been blessed, what more can you expect
this life, this life and then the next
i finger the hem of your dress, my universe at rest
we reach for starlight all night long but gravity's too strong
chained to this earth we go on and on and on
then a million suns cresting where you stood
a beauty in the neighborhood
this lonely planet never looked so good
this life, this life and then the next
with you i have been blessed, what more can you expect
this life, this life and then the next
i finger the hem of your dress, my universe at rest"

"the moon hung like a shadow on a rung over shanghai
and the soldier boys were returning home screaming ""bonzai!""
and the kids are still playing their games,
getting hustled and rustled out in the rain
as i sat inside listening to the broadcast.
oh save my soul sweet rock and roll 'cuz i'm sinking fast.
and then the band played.
well now the legendary chaplain of the fighting 51st
was getting ready to go.
i said ""padre do you know a cheap virgin who likes to tango?""
he said ""you can try linda lee;
around the corner and across the sea.
oh word is out, word is out she's fast.""
oh blow me down now linda, 'cuz i'm sinking fast.
yes and them cats are sure getting fat down in the trainyard.
and the sandman brings them dreams they ship out in boxcars.
the union says hold; break out the dice, break out the gold.
it's lunchtime at last.
and old big mama said george raff's tonight on the late show.
she sits straddling the kitchen chair really gung ho
she shivers with chills, wet with slotcar thrills
hypnotically lost in the glass
and we all sighed...
with the sunrise
as we watched the credits pass.
and the little blue dot went away.
and then the morning cloak fell down like a hoax over sleepytown
and garbage truck big lenny's out drinking the last round
he hurriedly sipped his beer, and poking fun of the queer
and threatened to kick his ass.
and the bell rang
and the horn blows
and he's outside pumping gas
but things were moving so slow tonight
so the kid goes back inside the station
and turns on the radio to his local am station
and the band played
right on the radio
it's on the radio
and he listened to the bass line
and the boys in the band sang

waiting for our time to come
where the green grass grows

in the field your long hair flowed
down by the tildenberry tracks
there 'neath the water tower
i carried you on my back
over the rusted spikes of that highway of steel
where no more thunder sounds
where the time goes

in the whispering tide
where the river flows

but in a play where the hero has no vice
and love comes without a price
so does trouble in paradise
don't matter who did the dusting or who did the sweeping
who did the trusting or who did the cheating when it's all gone
laying in a field on a summer's day
waitin' for those gray skies to clear away
knowing all love's glory and beauty
can vanish before you think twice

but a dream's just a dream in one empty heart
it takes more than one to rev it up and go
so let's get it running, we're two for the road
two one way tickets and a diamond ring
hell it don't matter what the rain might bring
when this world treats you hard and cold
i'll stand beside you, we're two for the road
when you're alone my love will shine the light
through the dark and starless night
i'll hold you close and never let you go
come on now honey, we're two for the road
i'll stand beside you and i'll never go
come on now girl, we're two for the road"
"i went out walking the other day
seen a little girl crying along the way
she'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again
someday your crying girl will end
and you'll find once again
two hearts are better than one
two hearts girl get the job done
two hearts are better than one
once i spent my time playing tough guy scenes
but i was living in a world of childish dreams
someday these childish dreams must end
to become a man and grow up to dream again
now i believe in the end
two hearts are better than one...
sometimes it might seem like it was planned
for you to roam empty hearted through this land
though the world turns you hard and cold
there's one thing mister that i know
that's if you think your heart is stone
and that you're rough enough to whip this world alone
alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind
that's why i'll keep searching till i find my special one
two hearts are better than one..."
"well the first frame finds her running
but the night pushes her deep within the tunnel
she camouflages herself in dayglo paint
and she sings her love songs through a funnel
and she clings to the walls like a cat who calls
the shots for life and for death
wearing nothing but the make up she uses
to try and cover up for herself
well if she can't hide her sword
she gives no terms for surrender
'cause she's living the third world war
the tunnel police, they steadily increase
the search for where she hides her kid
she swings on a vine across the state line
they measured the length of her skid
she never goes back to do something she didn't
or undo something she did
smoke streams from the street
and the night is complete
with a long and fiery belch
she's just another orphan annie cartoon and a raquel welch
she rides like caesar, brandishing a whip
on the hood of his squad car
as the siren wails she silently sails
leaving footprints in the tar
oh she breaks with the dawn
and by morning she's gone
leaving nothing but another night
she returns to her home
like a dog returns to a bone
another unsatisfied wife
and there's little booth
secure from the truth
he wants her more than he's got the guts to say
'cause as she needs to be real
he needs to conceal
the realness of his place
so he sings a little song
and in a chiffon sarong
she performs a black ballet in space
but she's another flop with a fancy name
and he's just another cop with a pretty face
so together they commit the ultimate crime
two hearts locked in true waltz time"
"used cars
my sister's in the front seat with an ice
cream cone
my ma's in the back seat sittin' all alone
as my pa steers her slow out of the lot
for a test drive down michigan avenue
now, my ma, she fingers her wedding band
and watches the salesman stare at my old
man's hands
he's telling us all about the break he'd
give us
if he could, but he just can't
well if i could, i swear i know just what
i'd do
now, mister, the day the lottery i win
i ain't ever gonna ride in no used car
again
now, the neighbors come from near and far
as we pull up in our brandnew used car
i wish he'd just hit the gas and let out
a cry
tell `em all they can kiss our asses
goodbye
my dad, he sweats the same job from
mornin' to morn
me, i walk home on the same dirty streets
where i was born
up the block i can hear my little sister
in the front seat blowin' that horn
the sounds echoin' all down michigan
avenue
now, mister, the day my numbers comes in
i ain't ever gonna ride in no used car
again"
"i'm driving a big lazy car rushin' up the highway in the dark
i got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin' over my heart
it's pounding baby like it's gonna bust right on through
and it ain't gonna stop till i'm alone again with you
a friend of mine became a father last night
when we spoke in his voice i could hear the light
of the skies and the rivers the timberwolf in the pines
and that great jukebox out on route 39
they say he travels fastest who travels alone
but tonight i miss my girl mister tonight i miss my home
is it the sound of the leaves
left blown by the wayside
that's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight
is it the cry of the river
with the moonlight shining through
that ain't what scares me baby
what scares me is losing you
they if you die in your dreams you really die in your bed
but honey last night i dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head
and god's light came shinin' on through
i woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew
it wasn't the cold river bottom i felt rushing over me
it wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true
it wasn't the wind in the grey fields i felt rushing through my arms
no no baby it was you
so hold me close honey say you're forever mine
and tell me you'll be my lonely valentine"
"vibes man in the alley, play me your spitball serenade,

"rainy night down in the engine house
sleepin' just as still as a mouse
a man came along and chase us out in the rain
well was that a vigilante man?
stormy days, we pass the time away
sleeping in some good warm place
a cop come along we give him a little race
say was that a vigilante man?
well tell me why does a vigilante man
tell me why does a vigilante man
carry that sawed off shotgun in his hands
to shoot his brothers and sisters down that no good vigilante man
well i ramble around from town to town
yeah i ramble around from town to town
yeah and they run us around like a wild herd of cattle lord
is that your vigilante man?
well tell me why does a vigilante man

"behind the walls where heat lightning falls
on five starred gnat faced princess
the buffalo man shoots at the tin cats
turns and shouts ""children, blow your bridges""
on death row halls where dustmen stall
where time's an enemy and a friend
at night jackals crawl from the cracks in the walls
and salvation is never spoken
morning sickness breaks the garrison gate
the cavalry cries for treason
the soldier strokes his pony and goes to shine the captain's sword
in this young boy's eyes lie reason
and the sergeant bursts in and cries ""i caught a prisoner, captain,
a prisoner, what ho !""
the captain looks up and says ""let her go""
""but captain, she patrols the light ships that patrol the sea around
the rainbow tips, whose bagpiper wail unbroken
she haunts the night and the dawnin' light
on her sounds and words your cavalry chokin' ""
the captain says ""have no fear, boys
for what you hear
because danger can't be spoken ""
the whirlwind crackles and i hear the rustle of shackles
from the stockade door bursts merlin
his eyes red, and swollen, like they've been pushed into the sun
his robes aflame and burnin'
he jumps a horse, tries to get away
but he gets caught in his eyes, tangled in his eyes
he falls to the ground, his neck is broken
his spirit rises high in the western sky
the magician lies an empty token
the sergeant walks over and kicks his body
and says ""captain, he's dead   what shall we do with him ?""
the captain says ""hang him
for though his live moments on this earth are well spent
and i can se his body is sure well bent
it's magic that must be broken ""
now night cradles low
the penniless weed plays wrath felt in the captain's corner
with anvil spread wide, the captain glides
each blow to scare her, not to hurt her
she spits ""what truth"" at the captain's boots
but he holds his rage suspended
the sergeant comes in stinkin' of soldier's gin
and cries ""captain, the storm she blows unending""
oh and the lightning cracked and the sky was hacked
by dagger rain it was torn
and the yard was charged into a raging sea
and the captain ran crazily
for the first time in his life, in the captain's heart
fear was born
the captain storms out on the stoop, panic strikes
he sees merlin's hung body stretched by the neck
silhouetted on his door
the sergeant screams ""captain, look high, look to the sky !""
some whirling, swirling emission ...
but the captain falls to his knees crying silent pleas
'cause he knows, he knows, and he thinks to himself
""a magician..."""

"when we fight and i wanna talk it out
you won't say nothing, nothing at all
you just sit there, you won't open that pretty mouth
i think you like keeping my back up against the wall
wages of sin, you keep me paying
wages of sin for wrongs that i've done
wages of sin, you keep me paying
wages of sin, one by one
i walk in the apartment, there's clothes thrown all over the place
you're crouched in the corner with makeup running down your face
i don't wanna believe what my heart keeps saying
you keep me on the line so you can keep me paying
wages of sin, we keep paying
wages of sin for the wrongs that we've done
wages of sin, we keep paying
wages of sin, that's how we have our fun
i remember when i was a little boy out where the cottonwoods grow tall
trying to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls
baby all the sounds i heard, even if they weren't real
i was running down that broken path with the devil snapping at my heels
i tried so hard, so hard in every way
swore someday i'd grow up, just throw it all away
cried all the tears, baby, that i could cry
stomached all my fears till they came rushin' up inside
darlin' i'm losin' and it's a mean game
still i play on and on just the same
wages of sin, i keep paying
wages of sin for some wrong that i've done

"i remember how rough your hand felt on mine on my wedding day
and the tears cried on my shoulder i couldn't turn away
well so much has happened to me that i don't understand
all i can think of is being five years old following behind you at the beach tracing your footprints in the sand
trying to walk like a man
by our lady of the roses we lived in the shadow of the elms
i remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the church whenever she heard those wedding bells
well would they ever look so happy again the handsome groom and his bride
as they stepped into that long black limousine for their mystery ride
well tonight you step away from me and alone at the alter i stand
and as i watch my bride coming down the aisle i pray for the strength to walk like a man
well now the years have gone and i've grown from that seed you've sown
but i didn't think there'd be so many steps i'd have to learn on my own
well i was young and i didn't know what to do
when i saw your best steps stolen away from you
now i'll do what i can
i'll walk like a man
and i'll keep on walkin'"

saw the ghost of elvis
on union avenue

then i watched him walk right through
now security they did not see him
they just hovered 'round his tomb

waiting for the king
down in the jungle room

they've got catfish on the table
they've got gospel in the air
and reverend green be glad to see you

every friday at the hollywood
and they brought me down to see her
and they asked me if i would   
do a little number
and i sang with all my might

"oh billy stares at cherry in the hall
and walks out into the rain so blessed and tall
standin' on the corner with a gun underneath his coat
beneath the stars on the street
oh on lexington avenue they stand
velvet aces they case the promised land
reachin' out across the hoods with both hands
oh, tryin' to catch a ride
tonight we're lovers in the cold
running past the graveyards in the snow
walking in the street with nowhere to go
and it's no, no, no
oh and the getaway driver waits outside the store
he pulls away just as billy runs out the door
oh and billy won't run anymore, no, no, no

and there's no trace of dawn
i'm stuck in this moonlight
it's leading me on
my body's on fire
and i can't stand the pain
this burning desire
i feel once again
now i'm fighting with madness
as i move down the street
surrounded by sadness
i can't take this heat
the streetlamps are glowing
like coals in the mist
their lights keep me moving
i just can't resist
now there's peace in this valley
but none in my mind
like a drunk in an alley
i'm stumbling blind
with no destination
at an unholy speed
i must keep on moving
try to walk off this need"
"she was just another war nurse
she could strike a noble pose
caring for our young boys when a bullet laid them low
she would hover over them and cry
and pull the cover over them when they'd die
she was just another lonesome lady, lover, sister of the gun
and though france would call her darling,
she was a nurse 'neath the rising sun
she knew no hells or heavens, or harbors or havens
she was every mother, sister, wife and lover
whose love a soldier boy was savin'
she believed in the birth of the broad sword
she was not a shielded one
though france would call her darlin'
she was nurse 'neath the rising sun
she was a soldier's shrapnel sweetheart, direct from the combat zone
she was a reincarnation o fthe virgin mary
she was the hooker down in san antone
and though her heart was somewhere in iceland
commanding the dawn patrol
blessed in this blood and stitched into these bones
the war nurse left her soul
blessed in this blood and stitched into these bones
the war nurse left her soul"
"there's a cross up yonder up on calvary hill
there's a slip of blood on a silver knife
there's a graveyard kid down below
where at night did come to life
and above the stars, they crackle in fire
a dead man's moon throws seven rings
well, we put our ears to the cold grave stones
this is the song they'd sing
we are alive
and though our bodies lie alone here in the dark
our spirits rise to carry the fire and light the spark
to stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart
a voice cried out, i was killed in maryland in 1877
when the railroad workers made their stand
well, i was killed in 1963 one sunday morning in birmingham
well, i died last year crossing the southern desert
my children left behind in san pablo
well they left our bodies here to rot
oh please let them know
we are alive
oh, and though we lie alone here in the dark
our souls will rise to carry the fire and light the spark
to fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart
let your mind rest easy, sleep well my friend
it's only our bodies that betray us in the end
i awoke last night in a dark and dreamy deep
from my head to my feet, my body had gone stone cold
there were worms crawling all around me
fingers scratching at an earth black and six foot low
and alone in the blackness of my grave
alone i'd been left to die
then i heard voices calling all around me
the earth rose above me, my eyes filled with sky
we are alive
and though our bodies lie alone here in the dark
our souls and spirits rise
to carry the fire and light the spark
to fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart
to stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart
we are alive"

commercial with the credit card

and you'd wanna come home
now it ain't hard feelings or nothin' sugar

it's just nobody knows baby where love goes
but when it goes it's gone gone

i turn the corner and i drive down your street
little gray houses, darling, looks like nowhere
but hey i know you're hidin' in there
come on out for just a little while
you know that heart of stone girl it just ain't your style

and when i tell you that i love you
i wanna have to shout it out loud

i won't do it to you
you see all the romantic movies
you dream and take the boy's home
but when the action fades girl

   make you cry like you do girl
now every night you go out looking
for true love's satisfaction
but in the morning you always end up
settling for just lights, camera, action
in another cameo role
with some bit play you're befriending
you're gonna go broken hearted
looking for that happy ending
well girl you're gonna you're gonna end up
just another lonely ticket sold
crying alone in the theater
at the end of the show
don't make us some little girl's dream
that can not ever really ever come true

i won't do it to you
yeah, i won't do it to you"

good men through the ages
they try to find the sun

i went down virginia
seekin' shelter from the storm
just caught up in the fable
i watched the tower grow
five year plan and new deals
wrapped in golden chains
still i wonder, yes i wonder
who'll stop the rain
heard the singers playin'
how we cheered for more
the crowd had rushed together
tryin' to keep warm
still the rain keeps falling
fallin' through the years

circus town's on the shortwave

fat lady, big mama, missy bimbo sits in her chair and yawns,

a ragged suitcase in his hand, he steals silently away from the circus grounds,
and the highway's haunted by the carnival sounds
they dance like a great greasepaint ghost on the wind,
a man in baggy pants, a lonely face, a crazy grin, runnin' home to some small ohio town
jesus, send some sweet women to save all your clowns
and circus boy dances like a monkey on barbed wire, and the barker romances with a junkie, she's got a flat tire,
and now the elephants dance real funky and the band plays like a jungle fire,
circus town's on the live wire.

"ol' catfish in the lake, we called him big jim
when i was a kid, my only wish was to get my line in him
skipped church one sunday and throw'd in my line
jim took that hook, pole and me right over the side
went drifting down past old tires and rusty cans of beer
the angel of the lake whispered in my ear
""before you chose your wish, son, you'd better think first
with every wish there comes a curse""
i fell in love with beautiful doreen
she was the prettiest thing this old town'd ever seen
i courted her and i made her mine
but i grew jealous whenever another man'd come walkin' down the line
and my jealousy made me treat her mean and cruel
she sighed, ""bobby, oh bobby, you're such a fool
don't you know before you chose your wish you'd better think first
with every wish there comes a curse""
these days i sit around and laugh at all the rivers i've crossed
but on the far banks there's always another forest where a man can get lost
well there in the high trees love's bluebird glides
guiding us 'cross another river on the other side

and though my heart's grown weary, and more than a little bit shy
tonight i'll drink from her waters to quench my thirst
and leave the angels to worry

talking about the weekend scrubbing off the dirt
some heading home to their families
some looking to get hurt
some going down to stovell wearing trouble on their shirts
i work for the county out of 95

in my head i keep a picture of a pretty little miss
someday mister i'm gonna lead a better life than this

working on the highway blasting through the bedrock

she was standing with her brothers back up against the wall
sometimes we'd go walking down the union tracks
one day i looked straight at ther and she looked straight back

working on the highway laying down the blacktop
working on the highway all day long i don't stop

i seek faith in your kiss, and comfort in your heart
i taste the seed upon your lips, lay my tongue upon your scars
but when i look into your eyes, we stand worlds apart
where the distant oceans sing, and rise to the plain
in this dry and troubled country your beauty remains
down from the mountain roads where the highway rolls to dark
'neath allah's blessed rain, we remain worlds apart
sometimes the truth just ain't enough
or it's too much in times like this
let's throw the truth away, we'll find it in this kiss
in your skin upon my skin, in the beating of our hearts
may the living let us in, before the dead tear us apart
we'll let blood build a bridge, over mountains draped in stars
i'll meet you on the ridge, between these worlds apart
we've got this moment now to live, then it's all just dust and dark
let love give what it gives
let's let love give what it gives"

coming home at the end of the working day
i was riding alone through the drizzling rain
on a deserted stretch of a county two lane
when i cam upon a wreck on the highway
there was blood and glass all over
and there was nobody there but me
as the rain tumbled down hard and cold
i seen a young man lying by the side of the road
he cried mister, won't you help me please
an ambulance finally came and took him to riverside
i watched as they drove him away
and i thought of a girlfriend or a young wife
and a state trooper knocking in the middle of the night
to say your baby died in a wreck on the highway

to the coal mines of appalachia
the story’s always the same
seven hundred tons of metal a day
now sir you tell me the world’s changed
once i made you rich enough
rich enough to forget my name
and youngstown
and youngstown
my sweet jenny i’m sinkin’ down
here darlin’ in youngstown
when i die i don’t want no part of heaven
i would not do heaven’s work well
i pray the devil comes and takes me
to stand in the fiery furnaces of hell"
"she promises to be yours forever and always
and you're too young to know it don't work out that way
when she kisses you and your heart skips
and you're ten feet off the ground
soon you'll be crying and that when you'll have found
that
your love is gonna let you down, boy
your love is gonna let you down
your love is gonna let you down, boy
your love is gonna let you down
well it's kisses and sweet talk
when she first starts coming round
but soon tears start falling down
you say every day she makes your dreams come true
but soon those very dreams will be the death of you
well
your love is gonna let you down, boy
your love is gonna let you down
your love is gonna let you down, boy
your love is gonna let you down
no cold denials, no one really lied
it was time spent, promise implied
and suddenly you see something new in her eyes
and in that moment you realize
lately you've been walking the streets at night
like an empty shadow in the morning light
like an empty shadow that's suddenly found
that your love is gonna let you down
your love is gonna let you down, boy
your love is gonna let you down
your love is gonna let you down, boy
your love is gonna let you down"
"your own worst enemy
you can't sleep at night
you can't dream your dream
your fingerprints on file
left clumsily at the scene
your own worst enemy has come to town
your own worst enemy has come to town
yesterday the people were at ease
baby slept in peace
you closed your eyes and saw her
you knew who you were
now your own worst enemy has come to town
your own worst enemy has come
your world keeps turnin' 'round and 'round
but everything is upside down
your own worst enemy has come to town
there's a face you know
staring back from the shop window
the condition you're in
now you just can't get out of this skin
the times they got too clear
so you removed all the mirrors
once the family felt secure
now no one's very sure
your own worst enemy has come to town
your own worst enemy has come
everything is falling down
your own worst enemy has come to town
your own worst enemy has come
everything is falling down
your own worst enemy has come to town
your flag it flew so high
it drifted into the sky"
"the skulls met the pythons
down at the first street station
alliance has been made in alleyways
all across the nation
these boys live off the milk of a silver jet
and the love of sweet young women
the pythons are down from old englishtown
and they 're looking to do some living
well the leader of the pythons
is a kid they just call zero
now terry's pop says these kids
are some kind of monsters
but terry says ""no, pop
they're just plain heroes""
zero and terry had found a love
that burned like wild fire
now terry's dad understood
that this zero was no good
a tramp, a thief and a liar
well from out of the darkness
that breaks the dawn
zero rode like twilight
he said ""tonight's the night
blind terry come on
terry come on
tonight is the night
pack your bags baby""
and together they ran like reindeers
through the streets
well like tomorrow the earth
is gonna catch on fire
now terry's dad hired some troopers
to kill zero and bring terry back home
they caught up in the night, like firelightthem starlight troopers....
zero marches through terry's field
they met the pythons down on route nine
but they refused to yield
now the pythons fought with blazed guns
and the troopers with swords of light
and zero and terry they ran away
and the gang fought all through the night
now some folks say
zero and terry got away
other said they were caught and brought back
ah, still young pilgrims to this day
go to that spot way down by the railroad tracks
where the troopers met the pythons
old timers cry on a hot august night
if you look hard enough, if you try
you'll see zero and terry and all the pythons
just hiking them streets up in the sky."
