you sell me down when you tell me you'll never
spend days unphased not to tell me, ""i love you""
and they might not be failing solo
and they might not be playing for the team

they will turn you in
they will turn you in and i know they will
they will come again

to build a private zone
or trigger a synapse
and free us from our traps
you won't see me turn my back
with my head against my stack
spinning deep and broken open skin
official ironman you are free
champions officially, but
you won't catch me on an open chin
to dine, alone
to build a private zone
or trigger a synapse
and free us from our traps
knockout punches for the freaks
happy little babies with red cheeks
you will rock them gently out of sync
confirmations through the wire
spitting gas into the fire
am i also worthy of a drink?

to build a private zone
or trigger a synapse

a buzzing one stringer
always quite a singer
did his wife in the dueling banjos...."

with faces that look just
like us
i look into the future
made up my mind and claimed my ground
don't ever let you too far
just be content with what we've found
like statues that will never ever rust
i'm telling you now
we'll never run out
if you are my friend
if i've always got you
then i'll never be blue
love me 'til the end
the day is decided
and we'll be united

"i celebrate
far too   but not exceeding my potential
risking injury   this is music for people 1,000 years old
slapping salt on soldier boy, his guts in his cupped hands

i celebrate over the sketches of a deteriorating landscape
how can a sissy play ape without risking injury?"
"as the icy breeze is shattered
by speaking to us warmly
to the nation of duress
and god yes, it's a mess
we know this and that
the romantic soul for us
in the lost hierarchy of land

forevermore!
i must try to believe this
and if i may consider
to look out from an opening

opening and closing
you recognize me  feel the hush"

and shoot me down
and bring me down
but i won't be around
as you run through the places you love
i remember the faces that cry
and they're pulling me back so i have to die
and watch me jumpstart at the first light of day
each new sensation just blows me away
don't look now, don't look now, i'm a phase
straight from ground zero, x marks the spot
i can't pretend to be something i'm not
'cause i'm a supernova erect and white hot

from my old window world
seemingly like an ancient demon
waking up and waved out
class examples of an onioned diagram
i’m here to follow footfalls
of a wasted plan

the options aren’t so good
plus once the intervention begins
it’s painful

we're bargaining for pardon
out of the straits
of the madhouse garden

that no one's faking
and if you fall asleep
none of us shall weep

we flew higher than at first we imagined
we came over for a spin of the globe
spat in rivers while the fish eggs were hatching
danced with angels to the pulse of the strobe

explore new horizons
and fall to the ground
chorus: how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel
how does it feel

taking kids to get a glimpse of the ghost
broken bottles at the top of the stairway

offspring and tag alongs were finding
the history book has lost its binding
pages everywhere
two titans without care will read them
we conjure ghosts and then we feed them
and if it all goes well we'll laugh a lot
and then we'll all take photographs
of what we made..lemonade
freedomcake quick to bake
trim the tree collectively
breath the air from the fair
and watch colored lights shine down
dancing round the lady's face
as we learned the sound
we can keep this violent pace
though we know that haste makes waste
and i'm giving you a ring

the line up who light up will surely decide the fate
of these incorrigibles
who plaster their messages up on the interstate

when the vodka kicks in
a night at the rockies
digging in for the slam
when she turn fifty

no song will do

they were bold and true
to the other side we pried
if we only knew

not such a place
not a good sign for we're running out of space

and maybe i was hurt
but i don't make myself to blame
i broke a small light
make everything all right
in the window of my world in my world

give not my freedom to release you
seek me in slumber
take me in the words that so complete you
touch me in worlds that i might reach you
give me your number
give not my freedom to release you

crawl with me in to the hole
where everyone can hide
we're in the wormhole
seeking to be safe again
without a single brave soul
leaking out tonight

washing us free of the daily pain
off the hook and down the drain
and out to the other side
to where the soil is rich and muddy in the riverbed
feed on the urgent promise
of the dead tonight"
