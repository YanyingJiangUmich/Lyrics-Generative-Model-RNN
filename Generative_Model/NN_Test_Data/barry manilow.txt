"i remember all my life
raining down as cold as ice,
shadows of a man
a face through a window
crying in the night
the night goes into
morning, just another day
happy people pass my way
looking in their eyes
i see a memory
i never realized
how happy you made me oh mandy
well you came and you gave without taking
but i sent you away, oh mandy
well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
and i need you today, oh mandy
i'm standing on the edge of time
i've walked away when love was mine
caught up in a world of uphill climbing
the tears are in my mind
and nothing is rhyming, oh mandy
well you came and you gave without taking
but i sent you away, oh mandy
well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
and i need you today, oh mandy
yesterday's a dream i face the morning
crying on the breeze
the pain is calling, oh mandy
well you came and you gave without taking
but i sent you away, oh mandy
well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
and i need you today, oh mandy
well you came and you gave without taking
but i sent you away, oh mandy
well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
and i need you"
"one voice singing in the darkness
all it takes is one voice
singing so they hear what's on your mind
and when you look around you'll find
there's more than one voice singing in the darkness
joining with that one voice
each and every note another octave
hands are joined and fears unlocked
if only one voice should start it on it's own
we need just one voice facing the unknown
and then that one voice would never be alone
it takes that one voice
i've been alive forever, and i wrote the very first song
i put the words and the melodies together
i am music and i write the songs
i write the songs that make the whole world sing
i write the songs of love and special things
i write the songs that make the young girls cry
i write the songs, i write the songs
and maybe the old songs will bring back the old times
maybe the old lines will sound new
maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
maybe old feelings will come through
maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away
maybe the old songs will bring back the old times and make her wanna stay
we're goin' hoppin' we're goin' hoppin' today
where things are poppin' the philadelphia way
we're gonna drop in on all the music they play
on the bandstand we're goin' swingin' we're gonna swingin' the crowd
and we'll be clingin' and floatin' high as a cloud
the phones are ringin' my mom and dad are so proud
i'm on bandstand and i'll jump, and hey, i may even show 'em my handstand
because i'm on, because i'm on the american bandstand
when we dance real slow i'll show all the guys in the grandstand
what a swinger i am, i am on american bandstand
i donâ€™t want to walk without you baby
i don't want to walk without you, baby
walk without my arm about you, baby
oh, baby, please come back or you'll break my heart for me
'cause i don't want to walk without you
no, siree
last night, i waved goodbye, now it seems years
i'm back in the city, where nothin' is clear
but thoughts of me, holdin' you, bringin' us near
and tell me
when will our eyes meet?
when can i touch you?
when will this strong yearnin' end?
and when will i hold you again?
even now when i never hear your name
and the world has changed so much since you've been gone
even now i still remember and the feeling's still the same
and this pain inside of me goes on and on, even now
even now when i have come so far
i wonder where you are
i wonder why it's still so hard without you
even now when i come shinin' through
i swear i think of you and god, i wish you knew
somehow, somehow
i saw you at the beechwood cafe
you looked at me and then you looked away
that was some kind
some kind of friend you turned out to be
you said you had places that you had to be
now who is gonna be there for me
that was some kind
some kind of friend you turned out to be
lady that was some kind
some kind of friend you turned out to be
baby that was some kind
some kind of friend you turned out to be
when my heart  is torn apart by the love i wish i had
well, i spend my  nights in the city's lights and things don't seem so bad
ya know the movement seems to soothe me
and the tempo takes control
and i lose my blues
when the new york city rhythm fills my soul
it's the new york city rhythm runnin' though life the poundin' beat of the city streets that keeps my dreams alive
i'm lost , i'm found i'm up , i'm down,  but somehow i survive
it's got to be the new york city rhythm in my life
oh, it's got to be the new york city rhythm in my life, in my life
at the copa , copacabana the hottest spot north of havana at the copa , copacabana
music and passion were always the fashion
at the copa....they fell in love
if i could find the words then i would write it all down
if i could only find a voice i would speak
but it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight
come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
it's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
it's running silent and angry and deep
it's there in my eyes and it's all i can say
come on look at me and read 'em and weep
read 'em and weep   for all the hours we'll be spending alone
read 'em and weep   for the dreams we'll ignore
running silent and deep
for all those promises we promised to keep
why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep
why don't you look at me and read 'em
when i wanted you i needed you
and i still can't bring myself to say i'm over you
when i gave you time to make up your mind
you turned you back on me
and now i turn my back on you
but somewhere down the road
our roads are gonna cross again
it doesn't really matter when
but somewhere down the road
i know that heart of yours will come to see
that you belong with me
this one's for you wherever you are
to say that nothin's been the same since we've been apart oh uh oh
this one's for all the love we once knew
like everything else i have, this one's for you
doctor, my woman is comin' back home late today
coudja maybe give me somethin' ?
'cause the feeling is gone and i must get it back right away
before she sees that
i've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again
all around, tryin' to get the feeling again
the one that made me shiver
made my knees start to quiver
every time she walked in
and i've looked high , low everywhere i possibly can but there's no  tryin' to get the feelin' again
it seemed to disappear as fast as it came
i've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again
and i'm ready to take a chance again
ready to put my love on the line with you
been livin' with nothing for show for it
you get what you get when you go for it
and i'm ready to take a chance again with you
let's hang on to what we got
don't let go girl, we got a lot
got a lot of love between us
hang on, hang on, hang on
come with me
somewhere in the night we will know
everything lovers can know
you're my song, music too magic to end
i'll play you over and over again
lovin' so warm, movin' so right
closin' our eyes and feelin' alive
we'll just go on burnin' bright
somewhere in the night
baby, i love you, come, come, come into my arms
let me know the wonder of all of you
baby, i want you now, now, now, and hold on fast
could this be the magic at last?
we dreamers have our ways
of facing rainy days
and somehow we survive
we keep the feelings warm
protect them from the storm
until our time arrives
then one day the sun appears
and we come shining through those lonely years
i made it through the rain
i kept my world protected
i made it throught the rain
i kept my point of view
i made it through the rain
and found myself respected
by the others who
got rained on too
and made it through
looks like we made it
looks like we made it
i'm singin' to the world, it's time we let the spirit come in
let it come on in
i'm singin' to the world, everybody's caught in the spin
look at where we've been
we've been runnin' around, year after year
blinded with pride, blinded with fear
but it's daybreak, if you wanna believe
it can be daybreak, ain't no time to grieve
said it's daybreak if you'll only believe
and let it shine, shine, shine
all around the world 
it's from me it's for you
it's from you, it's for me
it's a worldwide symphony
i write the songs that make the whole world sing
i write the songs of love and special things
i write the songs that make the young girls cry"
"her name was lola, she was a showgirl
with yellow feathers in her hair
and a dress cut down to there
she would merengue and do the cha cha
and while she tried to be a star,
tony always tended bar
across a crowded floor,
they worked from eight til four
they were young and they had each other
who could ask for more?
at the copa, copacabana
the hottest spot north of havana
at the copa, copacabana
music and passion were always the fashion
at the copa .... they fell in love
his name was rico, he wore a diamond
he was escorted to his chair, he saw lola dancin' there
and when she finished, he called her over
but rico went a bit too far, tony sailed across the bar
and then the punches flew and chairs
were smashed in two
there was blood and a single gun shot
but just who shot who?
at the copa, copacabana
the hottest spot north of havana
at the copa, copacabana
music and passion were always the fashion
at the copa .... she lost her love
her name is lola, she was a showgirl
but that was thirty years ago, when they used to have a show
now it's a disco, but not for lola
still in the dress she used to wear,
faded feathers in her hair
she sits there so refined, and drinks herself half blind
she lost her youth and she lost her tony
now she's lost her mind!
at the copa, copacabana
the hottest spot north of havana
at the copa, copacabana
music and passion were always the fashion
at the copa .... don't fall in love
don't fall in love"
"you know i can't smile without you
i can't smile without you
i can't laugh and i can't sing
i'm finding it hard to do anything
you see i feel sad when you're sad
i feel glad when you're glad
if you only knew what i'm going through
i just can't smile without you
you came along just like a song
and brighten my day
who would have believed that you where part of a dream
now it all seems light years away
and now you know i can't smile without you
i can't smile without you
i can't laugh and i can't sing
i'm finding it hard to do anything
you see i feel sad when you're sad
i feel glad when you're glad
if you only knew what i'm going through
i just can't smile
now some people say happiness
takes so very long to find
well, i'm finding it hard leaving your love behind me
and you see i can't smile without you
i can't smile without you
i can't laugh and i can't sing
i'm finding it hard to do anything
you see i feel glad when you're glad
i feel sad when you're sad
if you only knew what i'm going through
i just can't smile without you"
"midnight, not a sound from the pavement
has the moon lost her memory
she is smiling alone
in the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
and the wind begins to moan
memory, all alone in the moonlight
i can smile at the old days
it was beautiful then
i remember the time i knew what happiness was
let the memory live again
daylight, i must wait for the sunrise
i must think of a new life
and i mustn't give in
when the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
and the new day will begin
burnt out ends of smoky days
the stale cold smell of morning
the street lamp dies
another night is over
another day is dawning
touch me, it's so easy to leave me
all alone with the memory
of my day in the sun
if you touch me you'll understand what happiness is
look a new day has begun
memory, all alone in the moonlight
i can smile at the old days
it was beautiful then
i remember the time i knew what happiness was
let the memory live again"
"you remind me, i live in a shell
safe from the past and doing okay
but not very well
no jokes, no surprises,
no crisis arises my life goes along as it should
its all very nice but not very good
and i'm ready to take the chance again
ready to put my love on the line
with you...
been living with nothing to show for it
you get what you get when you go for it
and i'm ready to take a chance again with you
when she left me, in all my despair
i just held on, my hopes were all gone
then i found you there
and i'm ready to take the chance again
ready to put my love on the line
with you
been living with nothing to show for it
you get what you get when you go for it
and i'm ready to take a chance again,
ready to put my love on the line
with you
been living with nothing to show for it
you get what you get when you go for it
and i'm ready to take a chance again
ready to take a chance again, with you.....
with you"
"we walked to the sea
just my father and me
and the dogs played around on the sand
winter cold cut the air
hangin' still everywhere
dressed in gray, did he say
hold my hand
i said, love's easier when it's far away
we sat and watched a distant light
we're two ships that pass in the night
we both smile and we say it's alright
we're still here
it's just that we're out of sight
like those ships that pass in the night
there's a boat on the line
where the sea meets the sky
there's another that rides far behind
and it seems you and i are like strangers
a wide ways apart as we drift on through time
he said, it's harder now, we're far away
we only read you when you write
we're two ships that pass in the night
and we smile when we say it's alright
we're still here
it's just that we're out of sight
like those ships that pass in the night"
"no new year's day to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring
no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day
no april rain
no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of june
but what it is, is something true
made up of these three words that i must say to you
i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart
no summer's high
no warm july
no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is, though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do
i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care, i do
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart
i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care, i do
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart
of my heart
i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care, i do
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart
baby of my heart"
"candles burning
glasses are chilled and soon she'll be by
hope and pray she'll say
that she's willing to give us another try
and if all those plans i've made
don't melt the lady's heart
i'll put on the old 45's
and maybe the old songs
will bring back the old times
maybe the old lines will sound new
maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
maybe old feelings will come through
maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why
we ever walked away
maybe the old songs
will bring back the old times
and make her wanna stay
it's been too long since i've
seen her face light up when i come home
it's been too many hours
i've wasted staring at the phone
sweet old songs i'm counting on you
to bring her back to me
i'm tired of listening alone
and maybe the old songs
will bring back the old times
maybe the old lines will sound new
maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
maybe old feelings will come through
maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why
we ever walked away
maybe the old songs
will bring back the old times
and make her wanna stay
and make her wanna stay
wanna stay
and maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why

i've hungered for your touch, a long lonely time
 time goes by, so slowly and time can do so much
are you, still mine?
i need your love, i need your love
god speed your love to me
lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
to the open arms of the sea
lonely rivers cry, wait for me, wait for me
i'll be coming home, please wait for me

"the new year's eve we did the town
the day we tore the goal post down
we will have these moments to remember
the quiet walks, the noisy fun
the ballroom prize we almost won
we will have these moments to remember
though summer turns to winter
and the present disappears
the laughter we were glad to share
will echo through the years
when other nights and other days
may find us gone our separate ways
we will have these moments to remember
we will have these moments to remember
though summer turns to winter
and the present disappears
the laughter we were glad to share
will echo through the years
when other nights and other days
may find us gone our separate ways
we will have these moments to remember"

from fantasies to lies
this one's so real for me

baby i want you, now, now,

high up where the stallion meets the sun.

"time can never mend the careless whispers of a good friend
to the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
there's no comfort in the truth
pain is all you'll find
should've known better
i feel so unsure
as i take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
as the music dies, something in your eyes
calls to mind the silver screen
and all its sad good byes
i'm never gonna dance again
guilty feet have got no rhythm
though it's easy to pretend
i know you're not a fool
should've known better than to cheat a friend
and waste the chance that i've been given
so i'm never gonna dance again
the way i danced with you
time can never mend
the careless whispers of a good friend
to the heart and mind
ignorance is kind
there's no comfort in the truth
pain is all you'll find
i'm never gonna dance again
guilty feet have got no rhythm
though it's easy to pretend
i know you're not a fool
should've known better than to cheat a friend
and waste this chance that i've been given
so i'm never gonna dance again
the way i danced with you
never without your love
tonight the music seems so loud
i wish that we could lose this crowd
maybe it's better this way
we'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say
we could have been so good together
we could have lived this dance forever
but noone's gonna dance with me
please stay
and i'm never gonna dance again
guilty feet have got no rhythm
though it's easy to pretend
i know you're not a fool
should've known better than to cheat a friend
and waste the chance that i've been given
so i'm never gonna dance again
the way i danced with you

 what i did's so wrong
that you had to leave me alone"

or i'll never fall in love
in a restless world like this is
love is ended before it's begun
and too many moonlight kisses
seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

or i'll never give my heart
and the moment i can feel that you feel that way too
is when i fall in love with you.
when i fall in love with you."

it's the april rose
that only grows in the early spring
love is nature's way of giving
a reason to be living
the golden crown that makes a man a king
once on a high and windy hill
in the morning mist
two lovers kissed
and the world stood still
then your fingers touched
my silent heart and taught it how to sing
yes, true love's
a many splendored thing

it would be you

and want her now and then
i'll still be loving you

to see the real you
and sometimes when we touch
the honesty to much
and i have to close my eyes and hide
i want to hold you 'til i die
'til we both break down and cry
i wanna hold you 'til
the fear in me subsides
romancing all his strategie
leaves me battling with my pride
but through the insecurity
some tenderness survives
i'm just another writer
still trapped within my truths
a hesatant prized fighter
still trapped within my youth
and sometimes when we touch
the honesty to much
and i have to close my eyes and hide
i want to hold you 'til i die
'til we both break down and cry
i wanna hold you 'til
the fear in me subsides
at times i like to break you
and drag you to your knees
at times i like to break through
and hold you endlessly
at times i understand you
and i know how hard you've tried
i watched why love comands you
and i watched love pass you by
at times i think we're drifters
still searching for a friend
a brother or a sister
but then the passion flares again
and sometimes when we touch
the honesty to much
and i have to close my eyes and hide
i want to hold you 'til i die

so take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
and there's nothing left here to remind me,
just the memory of your face
ooh take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
and you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what i've got to face
i wish i could just make you turn around,
turn around and see me cry
there's so much i need to say to you,
so many reasons why
you're the only one who really knew me at all
so take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
and there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
now take a look at me now, cos there's just an empty space
but to wait for you, is all i can do and that's what i've got to face
take a good look at me now, cos i'll still be standing here
and you coming back to me is against all odds
it's the chance i've gotta take
take a look at me now"
"oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'cause no matter how far away you roam
when you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
for the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home
i met a man who lives in tennessee
and he was headin' for
pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
from pennsylvania folks are trav'lin' down
to dixie's sunny shore
from atlantic to pacific, gee,
the traffic is teriffic!
oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'cause no matter how far away you roam
when you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze

holidays you can't beat home
holidays you can't beat home,sweet home"
"are you lonesome tonight,
do you miss me tonight?
are you sorry we drifted apart?
does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
when i kissed you and called you sweetheart?
do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
is your heart filled with pain, shall i come back again?
tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
i wonder if you're lonesome tonight
you know someone said that the world's a stage
and each must play a part.
fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.
act one was when we met, i loved you at first glance
you read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
and why i'll never know.
honey, you lied when you said you loved me
and i had no cause to doubt you.
but i'd rather go on hearing your lies
than go on living without you.
now the stage is bare and i'm standing there
with emptiness all around
and if you won't come back to me
then make them bring the curtain down.
is your heart filled with pain, shall i come back again?
tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?"
"i'll be with you in apple blossom time
i'll be with you to change your name to mine
one day in may i'll come and say
happy the bride the sunshine's on today
what a wonderful wedding day there will be
what a wonderful day for you and me
church bells will chime
you will be mine
in apple blossom time
what a wonderful wedding day there will be
one day in may
what a very very wonderful day
for you and me dear
church bells will chime
you will be mine"
"now i've had the time of my life
no i never felt like this before
yes i swear it's the truth
and i owe it all to you
'cause i've had the time of my life
and i owe it all to you
i've been waiting for so long
now i've finally found someone
to stand by me
we saw the writing on the wall
as we felt this magical
fantasy
now with passion in our eyes
there's no way we could disguise it
secretly
so we take each other's hand
'cause we seem to understand
the urgency
just remember
you're the one thing
i can't get enough of
so i'll tell you something
this could be love because
i've had the time of my life
no i never felt this way before
yes i swear it's the truth
and i owe it all to you
hey, baby
with my body and soul
i want you more than you'll ever know
so we'll just let it go
don't be afraid to lose control, no
yes i know what's on your mind
when you say, ""stay with me tonight""
just remember
you're the one thing
i can't get enough of
so i'll tell you something
this could be love because
i've had the time of my life
no i never felt this way before
yes i swear it's the truth
and i owe it all to you
but i've had the time of my life
and i've searched though every open door
till i found the truth
and i owe it all to you
now i've had the time of my life
no i never felt this way before
yes i swear it's the truth
and i owe it all to you
i've had the time of my life
no i never felt this way before
yes i swear it's the truth
and i owe it all to you

"why don't we try a slow dance
it's all going by us too fast
oh, why don't we try a slow dance
and maybe this moment will last
all night long we've been dancing
dancing too far away
all night long i've been waiting for them to play
a slow dance
why don't we try a slow dance
before it all comes to a close
we'll see how it feels
and see where the feelings goes
oh, why don't we try a slow dance"
"they tell me, i'm the man of the hour.
  champagne, all around
it's been so long since i've been aloneâ€¦
sometimes, it gets me down.
and you, you're pretty as a picture
and i don't even know your name
but i sure would like to meet youâ€¦
why don't you see the show again.
i've been singin' these love songs forever
sometimes the words don't make much sense
so i'm living it all through the music
using last nights compliments
i've been playing for thousands of people
sometimes, it just never ends.
but the look in your eyes feels so good to me
why don't you see the show again.
god knows, there's not much i can say
i don't have time for love in my life
but if i ever thought, about changin' my mind
it might be with you, tonight.
i've been on the road, for so many weeks now
and i'm losin' track of timeâ€¦
tryin' to make ev'ryone happy
i wonder what's really mine.
and you, you're pretty as a picture
and i don't even know your name
but i sure would like to meet youâ€¦"

taking a turn on the spotlight
feeling that love
and spinning above the clouds

longing for hot light
lost in the crowd

fifteen minutes
a song so low
that no one ever heard
fifteen minutes

i'd sell my guts for glory
say the word
say the word
say the word
just gimme my shot
riding the world like a rocket
painting the sky
for all of those eyes below
wouldn't i fly the farthest
couldn't you clock it
wouldn't i go?
fifteen minutes
don't let me be an untold story
fifteen minutes
break the mold
and get me up to speed
fifteen minutes

and i'll lift off to glory
all i need
all i need

fifteen minutes
i'd sell my soul
in order to succeed

"he never wrote a song for linda
he wrote as though he lived alone
he wrote of dreams that end of sad brave men
inventing worlds he never know
but he never wrote a song for linda
and she was right there all alone
loved him back to life
when his luck ran low
but he never wrote a linda song
he nearly broke his heart at writing
linda kept him from despair
standing by his side, through the hungry days
but he hardly seemed to see her there
and he never wrote a song for linda
and she was right there all alone
the one real thing in his crazy world
and he never wrote a linda song
when the bills piled up and couldn't pay
he couldn't dream no more
so he hitched a ride and he road away
and he left a note for linda by the door
by the door
when times got rough he phone her
once or twice she took the call
then she changed her number and she turned her head
and linda never looked back at all
he'll never write a song for linda
and she was right there all alone
oh he knows,is no one understands
and he never wrote a linda song"
"on the road so long and lonely
can't believe i'm headed home to stay
god i miss my one and only
a little traveling music please
seems we're always seperating
still she doesn't let me lose my way
home is anywhere she's waiting
a little traveling music please
i may forget how much i care
but once i've left her laughter
two and three days after
i'm aware how much i miss her there
this time i'll stay home forever
hold her close and turn the world away
even if it's not forever
it it'll keep me from unraveling
a little traveling music please
two and three days after
i'm aware how much i miss her there
this time i'll stay home forever
hold her close and turn the world away
even if it's not forever
she's going to keep me from unraveling
a little traveling music please"
"walkin' around uptight
and lookin' for noise
frantic on a friday night
just one of the boys
phoney defenses, they fall in my way
a case of hot fire turnin' to stone
just a wind up poet with a chip on his shoulder
meetin' saturday mornin' alone
what's a nice boy like me
doin' in a place that never closes?
i can hardly hear ya'
holy moses lookin' so sad
what's a nice boy like me
doin' by the dance floor after hours?
dozin' over rows of whiskey sours?
feelin' so bad i'm feelin so bad for me
lost in the crowd alone
i'm drinkin' my third
i'm hungry for company,
but i can't think of the words
watchin' the girls, my heart in my hands
what a misplaced, pitiful sight!
just a stiff upper lip who'll be knowin' tomorrow
what he shoulda' been sayin' tonight!"

ain't nothing like the real thing
i've got your picture hanging on the wall
but it can't see or come to me
when i call your name
i realize it's just a picture in a frame
i read your letters when you're not here
but they don't move me and they don't groove me
like when i hear your sweet voice
whispering in my ear
ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
ain't nothing like the real thing
ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
ain't nothing like the real thing
i play my game of fantasy
and i pretend that i'm not in reality
i need the shelter
of your arms to comfort me
no other sound
is quite the same as your name
no touch can do quite as much
to make me feel better
so let's stay together
i've got the memories to look back on
and though they help me when you're gone
i'm well aware
but nothing can take the place of your being there
so glad we've got the real thing, baby
so glad we've got the real thing
ain't nothing like the real thing, baby"

but needing to belong,

through the good or lean years
and for all the in between years   come what may
who know where the road will lead us

the angels sing the sweetest song i ever heard
we speak and the angels sing
or am i reading music into every word
suddenly the setting is strange
i can see water and moonlight beaming
silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore
then suddenly i see it all change
long winter nights with the candles gleaming
through it all, your face that i adore
you smile and the angels sing
and though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
we kiss and the angels sing
and leave there music ringing in my heart
you smile and the angels sing
and though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
we kiss and the angels sing"

as i sit and stare through my window
i look out
at a world that's tearing apart

time goes by
and the times get worse
through my window
still i watch
as the madness darkens the heart
this is what i see.
and what do you see?
tell me how do we live in a world
that is crumbling away  
and be happy
as we are today?
still i watch
as i pin my hopes on the future
still i wait
wond'ring what in heaven will be  
is this an ending
or a beginning
that i see?
and what do you see?
and at times it appears that our happiness
hangs by a thread
can we hold on
through what lies ahead?
people say
i should turn away
from the window
all the worry
in all the world doesn't pay
and still i wonder
what kind of future
starts this way?
for you...

mispent with angel eyes tonight
so drink up all you people
order anything you see
and have fun you happy people

tell another lie

dancin' in the dark
shadow's in the night
slowly going wrong
trying to make it right
the silence is so loud
i can't hear the words we're saying
chorus:
anyone can do the heartbreak
everybody knows the dance
oh it's so easy to do
you tear a dream in two
to kill a true romance
anyone can do the heartbreak
anyone can make love end
it's gonna take a little pain
some fire and some rain
to bring it back again
i know you're afraid
baby so am i
you think you're going to fall
all you want to do is fly
we're up against the wall
and love is the chance we're taking
so baby look into my heart
tell me can't you see
i belong with you
you belong with me
when i hold you in my arms
we can hear the music playing

and two steps back
well we keep on moving

but baby it's cold outside
the welcome has been
how lucky that you dropped in
so nice and warm

my brother will be there at the door
like waves upon a tropical storm
my maiden aunt's mind is vicious

when i was just like the rest of the people
who never let dreams in their minds
music would play and say
maybe you're wastin' your time
before i knew what good could be

for trusting in me or my star
music would play and say
hey, what a dummy you are!
and when i heard all the words about passion
singin' to me about love of a fashion
that i never heard anywhere else
that's when i said,
â€œgotta get some of that for myselfâ€
and when i heard about hurtin' and healin'
beautiful words about beautiful feelings
what lots of believin' could do
beautiful music, i knew it just had to be true
you're beautiful, beautiful music!
before i saw my life in lights
when i couldn't taste the nights i was missin'
i'd listen alone in my bed
and music would sing to me
things no one else even said
and when i heard all the words about passion
singin' to me about love of fashion
that i never heard anywhere else
that's when i said,
â€œgotta get some of that for myselfâ€

in your sweet voice
there was music
and we danced the bolero de amor
let the drums carry us away!
they say all there is to say

sharing a love we have hungered for

i ride the border train
somewhere new to be
light the way for me
moon and memories
i ride the border train
city jumps up like a circus
neon flutters out of sight
the town itself is traveling
america unraveling
and swallowed in the hungry night
through the shadowland

got no kind of plan
i ride the border train
somewhere new to be
light the way for me
moon and memories
i ride the border train
there'll come a time
with no goodbyes
when i'll simply grab
that border train
and at journey's end
they will all be real
my lovers and friends
and i swear to god
there's time for me

my heart really flew, the day you caught my eye.
i hope that we two will never say ""good bye.""
clouds of gray have silver linings
when they reverse. i found your love

i'm gonna tell you 'bout your lovin'
and your kissn' and your huggin'
and your sweet turtle dovin' pretty baby.
i won't be satisfied til i hear 'em play,

listen to me baby and i don't mean maybe.
listen to my story, it's terrifficly true.
i gotta find a way of telling
you that i really go for you.
i hope you really believe me baby
'cause i certainly do.
'cause you're thrillin' me, you're really,
really thrilling when you tell me
that you probably got a kind of crush on me,
that moves me, grooves me.
how divine can one woman be?
well little darlin', you got me fallin'.
you got me goofy and g**.
i'm gonna get carried away.
just think, you're gonna be mine someday.

park a little, stop a little,
spark a little, live a little, love a little,
maybe turtle dove a little baby.
every time you hold me so near,
nobody loves me like you, dear.
let's stop a little, squeeze a little,
probably maybe tease a little,
try a little, sigh a little,
maybe have to cry a little bit,
'cause to tell you the truth,
i'm gonna love you and that's it.
'cause i love you baby,
love you baby, love you baby, love you baby,
with all my heart.
oooh, listen to me while i say i let
a lotta little ladies get away
because i know, i know pretty baby, i know,
i know, pretty baby,
i know you're the one, yes you're the one.
i knew when i met you
what a break it was to get you.
when it's cloudy and gray and that's the worst.
how do you cause the cloud to burst?
you got to find a lover,
find a lover, find a lover, find a lover.
if it's silvery under clouds of gray.
how do you chase the clouds away?
you gotta find a little girl
and make her love you a lot.
don't ever leave unless you flip your
lid and really want to ruin the plot.
sounds easy does it?
light as a breeze thru the trees.
boy, how pleasant was it?
pleasant as one summer day, boy.
it's so wonderful, what a love can do.
look at what love has done for you.
hey, i'm a lucky lover, lucky lover,
i got the love you should discover.
i was blue and i was always wearing a frown,
because my gal had turned me down.
then we met and you can bet
i knew from the first, you were my love,
and that's when the old gray cloudburst.
take a look at me. boy take another look,
take another look, take another look,
take another good, long, look at me.

clouds of gray have silver linings

pretty face, i know a swingin' place, come on dance with me,
romance with me on a crowded floor.
and while the rhythm swings, what lovely things i'll be sayin',
for what is dancing but making love set to music, playin'.
when the band begin to leave the stand and folks start to roam,
as we wing home, cheek to cheek we'll be,
come on, come on, come on, come on now
come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
if you can use, some exotic booze
there's a bar in far bombay
come fly with me, come fly, lets fly away
come fly with me, let's float down to peru
in lama land, there's a one man band
and he'll toot his flute for you
come fly with me, lets take of in the blue
once i get you up there, where the air is rarefied
we'll just glide, starry eyed
once i get you up there, i'll be holding you so near
you may here, angels cheer   cause were together
weather wise it's such a lovely day
just say the words, and we'll beat the birds
down to acapulco bay
it's perfect, for a flying honeymoon   they say
come fly with me
come on ,come on,come dance with me
come on,come on,come fly"

i saw you in the shadows
you were actin' so free
i knew the last thing on your mind was me
i could hear the laughter
and from that moment after
girl, you had my pride down on its knee
who does your night belong to
now that i'm gone
does he call you baby, all night long
who does your night belong to
who is the one you turn to
are you dancin' to our favorite song
dance away, it's only my mind you're takin'
dance away, it's only my heart you're breaking
if i've lost my touch
go on and give unsatisfied
my need for you is very much alive
i can make it on my own
my love will survive
i will find someone to get me by
but i'll be left with feelin's
that will go unsatisfied
my need for you is very much alive
dance away, it's only my mind you're takin'
dance away, it's only my heart you're breaking

that's where i'm a dancin' fool
i'll show you some moves
smooth as satin
and others they don't teach in school
when that crooner starts in to scattin'
just give me a chance an'
my tuxedo pants an'
presto!
i'm a dancin' fool
when those trumpets blare, man

somebody calls

livin' next door?
here at the mayflower
here at the mayflower
at the corner of main
and the road out of town
the mayflower rises
all battered and brown
a city block deep

how many stories inside?
so many curtains
so many locks
eyes at the spy hole
somebody knocks
measuring morning
on so many clocks
do you know who's
livin next door?
right here at the mayflower
right here at the mayflower

all at once someone goes
always new faces
that nobody knows
a panel left blank
on the board by the door
old lovers that meet like before
so many voices
so many names
so many photos
in so many frames

don't let the fire start
if you should fall
i'm afraid i'll follow you
now i'm on the other side of love
lookin' right at you
there you are so young and sure
your life has room enough for two
so it's up to me to try and say
words that didn't stop me yesterday

every empty night
to regret a life that could'a been
maybe you were right
just forget that emptiness within
so if you go
before that moment's gone
look at me the way
i'll remember every single day
from now on
you deserve
i don't know…
what…

"barry talking:
well i may have imagined singing back then but you know when i actually got into the music business, it wasn't as a singer at all: it was as an accompanist.
i started out playing for auditions, and from where i sat i learned alot because only one out of a hundred ever got the job they were auditioning for. really, one out of a hundred.
but that didn't stop the rest..no sir.
barry singing:
i learned more from failure than i learned from success.
i learned from no thank you, so much more than from yes.
i learned to be willing to lead with my chin.
and if i were willing to lose, i could win.
i learned from the losers who got right back in line.
the dimmer their future, than the brighter they'd shine.
three cheers for the one, the one in a hundred.
but god bless the other 99.

it's gotta get easier from now on
i've been runnin' all my life
lord, i've run for all my life
seein' joy and seein' people grievin'
seein' towns and don't remember leavin'
never saw no blue birds in my sky
but don't you see i'm halfway over the hill
i'm passin' over the hardest part
i'm halfway over the hill
it's gotta get easier from now on
oh i'm halfway over the hill
i'm passin' over the hardest part

"harmony
unforgettable harmony
harmony
first there was harmony
and there was rhyme
this was our time
harmony
did we have harmony
and that's just about all we had!
suddenly
a little harmony
and the poverty's not so bad
thin, we were
poor as sin in berlin, we were!
patches on our pants
mercif'lly, when you're in harmony
you're in a trance
others went marching
not us, we'd dance
no one in grodnogubernia
ever learned to dance like this!
spoken:
(believe it or not i was a rabbi before all this started!
in grodnogubernia yet!)
if you're in grodnogubernia
tell em', this you shouldn't miss!
harmony
all arm in arm were we
well, except when the punches flew
squabbles, sure
but squabbles don't endure
when there's harmony in the brew
then did we
oh, so splendidly blend, did we
like a spell had come
it was clear
my pals and i could hear
a different drum
outside they hollered!
but we had…harmony!
in this joint
all encounters with counterpoint
end in harmony
and it's clear
no man's a solo here
not even me
no solo mio!
no we've got harmony!
when we've got harmony
then just maybe we've got a chance
harmony, the best is harmony!
and the rest is a song and dance!
where you find
you're in harmony
there you find
shelter in a storm
every note
a button on the coat
that keeps you warm
stars have the heavens
but we've got harmony!
harmony!
harmony!
harmony!
troubles disappear
and what you feel is what you hear
not what you see!
yes, first there was
harmony!"

"so all alone
little girl blue
you tell me the tale
and stand there crying
i'm here for you
you know that i care
listening to you
inside i'm dying
your heart may be breaking
but my heart is breaking too
he doesn't care if you're all alone
but i do
he doesn't care if you come back home
but i do, yes i do
why can't you feel it too
i'm your best friend
a brother you say
hurting me so
to see your sorrow
knew all along
he's not for you
sadness and tears
but tomorrow
you'll see how i need you
and maybe you'll need me too
he doesn't care if he breaks your heart
but i do
he doesn't care if you fall apart
but i do

on someone whoe doesn't deserve it
if you belonged to me i'd love you more each day"
"it really doesn't matter if he
suffered all he claims
you know he started somewhere
and he found his way to fame
and feeding on the lonely crowd
he finally belongs
a power by the microphone he sings
his troubled songs
he's a star
no one can tell him anymore
he'll ride as far
as the road can go
and what it costs, he oughta know
he said he'd do it
he's a star
they're hangin' on his music
as it fills the concert hall
and he's teasin' them with moments
when you think he'll give it all
but he's holdin' back the total, 'cause
that's how he works the spell
yeah, he likes to leave 'em hungry
yeah he loves to hear 'em yell!
'cause he's a star
no one can tell him anymore
he'll ride as far
as the road can go
and what it costs, he oughta know
he said he'd do it
he's a star
and finally, the wild applause
that cleans his soul and saves
he's left with no companions
only enemies and slaves
he's scared again the show
was slow, he felt it fall behind
tomorrow night's already raising riot in his mind
but he's a star
no one can tell him anymore
he'll ride as far
as the road can go
and what it costs, he oughta know
he said he'd do it
he's a star"
"i used to be such a soft touch

you're still a part of me

forget things that we used to do?
forget all the dreams that we shared?
and how my life was knowing you cared?

when i look in your eyes
i still go crazy
no my heart just can't high
that old feeling in side
way deep down inside
oh baby
you know when i look in your eyes
i go crazy
you say he satasified your mind
tells you all of his dreams
i know how much that means to you
i realize that i was blind
just when i thought i was over you
i see your face and it just ain't true
you know it just ain't true
i go crazy
when i look in your eyes
i still go crazy
that old flame comes alive
it starts burning inside
way deep down inside

the room that you cared for
so i haven't changed the room
how did the years slip away

what am i to do
so many fantasies
plans that we made
that will never come true

in her room alone at night
she just moved in a month ago
she isn't gonna play the game
i though she'd smile
and come on slow
i still don't even know her name
she must like being lonely
got no time for anyone
but i hear her play that stereo
right through to the rising sun
i hear her playing music
in her room alone all night
through the day she's so elusive
staying safe and out of sight
if you say hello she lets it go
cool and so polite
and i hear her playing music
in her room alone at night
baby are you sad and lonely
or did somebody do you wrong
'cause i know that you need only
look my way
and they'll play our song
and i love your nightly music
but you can't keep playing through
'cause i'm having trouble sleeping
and when i do i dream of you
i thought i'd try and break the freeze
and win her heart with harmony
so i answered back
and played a stack of my favorite cd's
but she just doesn't hear me
doesn't have a word to say
so i stay awake and turn it up
hoping she'll look out my way
i hear her playing music
in her room alone at night
through the day she's so elusive
staying safe and out of sight
if you say hello she lets it go
cool and so polite
and i hear her playing dave koz
in her room alone at night
in her room alone at night
baby are you sad and lonely
baby won't you tell me your name
i'm in my room alone at night
you're in your room alone at night"

dream upon dream

you can make my dreams come true

i just want to be the one in your life
for ever, for always
i just want to be the one in your life
for ever , for always

to make me feel big
to make me feel proud

is all that i need
to feel like a man

i won't dream my life away

to make my dream a reality

i miss you
and it never goes away
i miss you
people smile and while
i take and even laugh
i'm not even half the man they knew
without you
when i'm in our bed each night
and i turn out the light
oh how i miss you
little things reminding me about you
who will i annoy again, if not you?
in my silent room sometimes
i'll close my eyes
and i whisper sweet good byes
you'll never hear
esther dear.....
fifty years, ester and joe
tell me how could this be so?
oh how i miss you
was i there
when you needed me to be there?
could you see
there wasn't one day
when you weren't my best girl?
though we both drove each other crazy
i love all the love you gave me
and you where all that mattered
in my world
everyday i love you more
and miss you
and i wish you knew
that through the darkest night
you are still the light
that helps me find my way
and i pray
one day we will meet again
and all this emptiness will end
and i will kiss you
'till that day
though we're apart
i'll hold you close
here in my heart
but god"
"my love must be a kind of blind love
i can't see anyone but you
and dear, i wonder if you find love
an optical illusion, too?
are the stars out tonight?
i don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'cause i only have eyes for you, dear
the moon may be high
but i can't see a thing in the sky
'cause i only have eyes for you
i don't know if we're in a garden
or on a crowded avenue
you are here, so am i
maybe millions of people go by
but they all disappear from view
and i only have eyes for you"

i should go around weeping
i should care
i should go without sleeping
strangely enough i sleep well
'cept for a dream or two
but then i count my sheep well
funny how sheep can love you to sleep

i shouldn't let it upset me
i should care
but it just doesn't get me
maybe i won't find someone
as lovely as you

i'll call you at three in the mornin'
wailin' my woes to the sky
i'll slip out of sight without warnin'
and return with a gleam in my eye

"after i've had my last cigarette
when the night is as black
as the nights goin' to get
well i'm still wild awake

though i can't stand the drinks
and i can't stand the noise
when i know i'll be back
cause their's no other choice
i know i was a fool, to let you go
i was a fool, to think that i could sleep a wink
in this big and deep bed by myself
and i was a fool to wate ,until it was to late
to tell you just how i felt
and after i've been with somebody new
and she know's what to say
ah but not what to do
then i know what i've lost

ah but not what to do

and i was thinking maybe later on
we could get together for awhile

and i really do miss your smile
i'm not talking 'bout moving in
and i don't want to change your life
but there's a warm wind blowing, the stars are out
and i really love to see you tonight

take a drive along the beach
or stay at home and watch t.v.
you see it really doesn't matter much to me
i'm not talking 'bout moving in
and i don't want to change your life
but there's a warm wind blowing, the stars are out
and i really love to see you tonight

so don't have to lie
we both play that game before
say i love you to say goodbye

then tomorrow we'll dawn
and the days of our years
will rise on that morn'

to embrase without fears
we will kiss with our eyes
we will sleep without tears

with our arms open wide
then the young and the old
will stand at our side
if we only have love
love that's falling like rain
then the parch desert earth
will grow green again

for the hym that we shout
for the song that we sing
then we'll have a way out
if we only have love
we can reach those in pain
we can heal all our wounds
we can use our own names
if we only have love
we can melt all the guns
and then give the new world
to our daughters and sons
if we only have love
then jersusalem's stands
and then death has no shadow
there are no foreign lands
if we only have love
we will never bow down
we'll be tall as the pines
neither here or nor clowns
if we only have love
then we'll only be men
and we'll drink from the grail
to be born once again
then with nothing at all
but the middle we are
we'll have conquered all time"
"sometimes late at night
when the shadows made by street lamps
cast a darkened silver light
you'll drift into my mind
reminding me of all i've lost
and all i've yet to find
so many things i know i should have told you
now what i wouldn't give if i could hold you
if you were here with me tonight
this time i'd never let it end
we'd find those feelings we once had
and feel them all again
we'd make love stronger than before
and give each other even more
and finally find a way to make it right
if you were here with me tonight
here with me tonight
somehow now i see
how time can soften
even the most painful memory
now what we had is gone
and the sooner i believe in that
the sooner i'll go on
but love like ours comes just once in a lifetime
so i tell myself it just wasn't the right time

tonight the minutes seem like hours
how long before the light of day"

this is the first time i've ever been alone like this
the silence covers wall to wall
i never knew how suddenly the night can fall
far away
i can here the city screams
drift away
i could be beside you in my dreams
chorus:
in another world
i could walk away
pretend there was nothing
i wouldn't need you anyway
in another world
but not in this world
i have no stronghold to defend
but still my heart is outside, beating at the door again
no promises to make or keep
and though i'm free to go
i end up chasing sleep again
drift away
wonder if you think of me
yesterday, is the place i'm going endlessly
repeat chorus
and though i realize the truth
is not idealized in you
why should i be surprised to find
that you are always on my mind
repeat chorus 2x

in this world somebody
she was put on earth for me
where can her love be?

i'm reaching out
i'm in search of love
you're everything that i'm dreamin' of
i can't give up, no!

that day or night time
there is no right time
for a heart to be alone
i just can't go on . . so

"in the wee small hours of the morning
while the whole wide world is fast asleep
you lie awake and think about the girl
and never ever think of counting sheep
when your lonely heart has learned its lesson
you'd be hers if only she would call
in the wee small hours of the morning
that's the time you miss her most of all
when the sun is high in the afternoon sky
you can always find something to do
but from dusk till dawn
as the clock ticks on
something happens to you
when your lonely heart has learned its lesson
you'd be hers if only she would call
in the wee small hours of the morning"
"how have i found you?
how in the world?
now that i've found you
you are my world
in these times that keep us guessing
you're my answer and my blessing
pretty damn amazing, given
this peculiar world we live in
in this world
that's lost all its reason
at last there's a reason
for hope in my heart
in this world
unsure of its future
so sure of you
i say, let the future start!
in this world
that's yearning for someone
to answer the call
from out of the blue
in this world
i prayed there would come one
magnificent someone
someone like you
barry and group:
in this world
that's lost all its reason
at last there's a reason
for hope in our hearts
in this world unsure of its future
somehow with you
i'm sure where the future starts
in this world
that's yearning for someone
to answer the call
from out of the blue
in this world
i prayed there would come one
magnificent someone
someone like you"
"baby when i met you there was peace unknown
i set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
i was soft inside
there was something going on
you do something to me that i cant explain
hold me closer and i feel no pain
every beat of my heart
we got something going on
tender love is blind
it requires a dedication
all this love we feel needs no conversation
we can ride it together , ah ha
making love with each other , ah ha
islands in the stream
that is what we are
no one in between
how can we be wrong
sail away with me
to another world
and we rely on each other , ah ha
from one lover to another , ah ha
i cant live without you if the love was gone
everything is nothing when you got no one
and you walk in the night
slowly losing sight of the real thing
but that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
too deep in love and we got no way out
and the message is clear
this could be the year for the real thing
no more will you cry
baby i will hurt you never
we start and end as one
in love forever
we can ride it together , ah ha
making love with each other , ah ha
islands in the stream
that is what we are
no one in between
how can we be wrong
sail away with me
to another world
and we rely on each other , ah ha
from one lover to another , ah ha"
"hide your heart from sight
lock your dreams at night
it could happen to you
don't count stars or you might stumble
someone drops a sigh and down you tumble

run when church bells ring
it could happen to you
all i did was wonder how
your arms would be
and it happened to me
keep an eye on spring
run when church bells ring
it could happen to you
all i did was wonder
how your arms would be
and it happened to me"

and i see in your eyes
that you've been lonely too baby
we've been all alone on our own for so long
but it's all behind us
the words no one heard when we sang our sad song
well it's all behind us now
everytime i looked for love
it looked the other way
now love has turn around
it's smiling at me
now someone loves me
all the nights in the moonlight
with no one to hold
take a good look at us baby!

but it's all in the game
soon he'll be there at your side
with a sweet bouquet
and he'll kiss your lips
and caress your waiting fingertips
and your hearts will fly away
soon he'll be there at your side
with a sweet bouquet
then he'll kiss your lips
and caress your waiting fingertips
and your hearts will fly away"

it's not so bad you know.
it's just another night,
that's all it is, it's not the first,
it's not the worst you know,

we'll get through this.
we've made mistakes,

as far as i can see
this is heaven
and speaking just for me
it's ours to share
perhaps the glow of love will grow
with every passing day
or we may never meet again

"well not to long ago in nineteen forty four
when every mother's son was goin' off to war
they had to lift they spirits high for uncle sam, motherhood and apple pie
instead of spendin' money that they didn't have
in hot spot in the bronx
they went to hear the kind of jazz
you hear in funky honky tonks
it made you wanna
jump, shout, knock yourself out
boogie woogie beat is what i'm talkin' about
if you had the heebie jeebies
you could dance away
to the boogie woogie music
the piano man was playin'
you could jump, shout, knock yourself out
boogie woogie beat is what i'm talkin' about
you could pull a switcheroonie
if you felt low down
with the boogie woogie beat
of a piano man who's goin' to town
it had the kind of rhythm that would fill the hall
the plinkin' and the plunkin' drove 'em up the wall
then they would dance and drink their gin
and when the fuzz buzzed they'd join in
so everybody partied 'till the cows came home
'cause that's what boogie's for
and every night that dump would jump
and keep 'em comin' back for more
because it made you wanna
jump, shout, knock yourself out
boogie woogie beat is what i'm talkin' about

her name was … lola!
she's from tulsa.. yeah!
just arrived, grand central station, two suitcases in hand
and a dream in her heart
just arrived track seventeen
all the way from tulsa okla nowhere
where's my chauffeured limousine?
where's the marching band?
just in time to take the town
and though my knees are shaking
i'm making my stand
it all starts now
i can see my name in neon
i won't allow
any cloud to rain on me!
don't ask me how
but before too long
i'll be on some marquee
new york or bust!
i've just arrived!
just arrived track seventeen

when i left, i left my past behind
just imagine, here i am is the girl from work
the kid they all made fun of

"when it all goes crazy and the thrill is gone
the days get rainy and the nights get long
when you get that feeling you were born to lose
staring at your ceiling
thinking of your blues
when there's so much trouble that you want to cry
the world has crumbled
and you don't know why
when your hopes are fading
and they can't be found
dreams have left you waiting
friends have let you down
just remember i love you and it'll be alright
just remember i love you
more than i can say
just remember i love you
and it'll be alright
maybe then your blues will fade away
when you need a lover
and you're down so low
you start to wonder
but you never know
when it feels like sorrow is your only friend
knowing that tomorrow
you'll feel this way again
when the blues come calling
at the break of dawn
the rain keeps falling
but the rainbow's gone
when you feel like crying
and the tears won't come
then your dreams are dying
then you're on the run
just remember i love you
more than i can say
just remember i love you"
"if you're looking for the dream you dreamed of,
open your eyes.
if you're looking for the one and only
in your life, oh darling.
if you're looking for a friend to turn to,
someone to care,
when all the world is out to hurt you,
i'll be there, oh darling.
reach out your hand, reach out for me,
i'll be walking beside you through it all
and we'll stand tall.
when we're blown by the wind,
torn by the storm,
we'll always find the love we need
to keep each other, keep each other warm.
well you talk about toleration,
well i know the score,
and if you ever want liberation
there's the door, oh darling.
living in love is bittersweet,
you've got to have faith on a lonely street.
but i'll be walking beside you
through it all, and we'll stand tall.
 come sail into my arms,
the harbor of my heart,
and trust that love is all we need to keep each other,
keep each other warm.
we'll keep each other warm,
we'll keep each other warm,
we'll keep each other warm,"
"got dust on my piano
and dishes in the sink
your side of the bed is cold
i haven't slept a wink
so i read your goodbye letter
to the face inside my drink
lay me down and roll me out to sea
got your picture in my wallet
and some pictures inmy mind
a packettfull of memories
i never thought i'd find
and it's rainin' like a monday
and the world seems so unkind
lay me down and roll me out to sea
lay me down roll me out to sea
callin' on a mighty wave to cover me
lay me down roll me out to sea
heaven if you're ready shine your light on me
now listen to my story cause i haven't told it all
i saw her with her new love
she turned to me and called
when they asked, â€œhow ya' doin'â€
i coulda' crumbled like a wall
so lay me down and roll me out to sea
lay me down roll me out to sea
callin' on a mighty wave to cover me
lay me down roll me out to sea"
"i tried to tell you there's trouble on the way
i lost the feeling that i once had
but when i held you there was nothing i could say
i couldn't bare to see you hurt so bad
so i'll be leaving in the morning
wishing that i could stay
and though i'll miss you every morning
it's the only way
so i'll be leaving in the morning
but how can i tell you why
i never gave you any warning
and now i don't know how to say goodbye
i tried to tell you there was something that i miss
something i couldn't dare to find with you
but i was blinded by your love every time we kissed
afraid i never find a love so true
so i'll be leaving in the morning
but how can i tell you why
i never gave you any warning
and now i don't know how to say goodbye
i waited too long but now i see
it's no good for you, it's no good for me
you can't see it now
but one day you'll know i just had to go
oh, oh, oh, oh
so i'll be leaving in the morning
wishing that i could stay
and though i'll miss you every morning
it's the only way
so i'll be leaving in the morning
but how can i tell you why
i never gave you any warning"

everything we´re dreaming of will soon be ours.
anything that you desire,
anything at all.
everyday i´ll take you higher
and i´ll never let you fall.

for another world of wonderous things.
we´ll see the universe and dance on saturns´s rings.
fly with me and i will be your wings.

"i never feared the devil
or the gypsy in my soul
but you're not on the level
and i'm not in control
and i'm afraid your baby blues
are just too much for me
and i'm afraid i'll lose my heart
if you don't set me free
let me go!
i don't wanna believe you
i just wanna be gone
i just wanna be gone
let me go!
don't say how much i need you
say goodnite and move on
say goodnite and move on
if you get me under your spell
i'll be lost for good, i can tell
let me go!
don't let me love you
let me go!
hey, i never bought a hustle
and i never took a dive
i've always had the muscle
to get through love alive
but i'm afraid your lovely lies
might just do me right in
and i'm afraid to play tonite
cause i know that i won't win
let me go!
i don't wanna be lovers
i just wanna be free
i just wanna be, wanna be, wanna be free
let me go!
you've got so many others
have some pity on me
some pity on me
on my own i'm doin' just great
so don't mess around with my fate
let me go!
don't let me love you"

"remember i sent you a picture
i know all the names in your band
i was the girl wearing yellow down front
i was the first one to stand
it's silly to think you'd remember
it's silly pretending you'd care
but i want you to know i was there last night
i was there, i was there, i was there
sometimes i think we're connected
i dreamed we were talking last night
day to day stress just undoes me at times
but listening to you makes it right
i'm positive someday you'll see me
and love me just like it was planned
i feel all the sorrow you're trying to hide
you'll realize i understand
oh how i understand
another room
where the lights are too bright
not gonna sleep
i want it just right
another hotel room
random replay
there's too many touching me
keep 'em away
move into midnight
just turn off the pager
i tell ya, the well has run dry
too tired to sleep
too wired to try
fast track to nowhere
so heavy, so high
too many scenes
and i'm losin' the names
silence and talk
both feelin' the same
all the same city
all the same night
step over the bodies, boy
turn out the light
forever, whatever
what's winning or losing
there's nothing my money can't buy
too tired to sleep
too wired to try
i'll pass on the party
so heavy, so high
hey i feel the moon breathin'
i hear electricity
i know the size of the sky
too tired to sleep
too wired to try
time hangin' frozen
so heavy, so high
you never waved back at the airport
i covered your poster in mud
i cut out the eyes on the photo you signed
i wrote you a poem in blood
i'm stupid to think i could matter
a loser pretending you'd care
to you i'm a nothing
i ought to be dead
but night after night
i'll be there, i'll be there, i'll be there
the floor's movin' slower
the frequency's fadin'
i tell ya, the well has run dry
too tired to sleep
too wired to try
fast track to nowhere
so heavy, so high"
"goodbye
there's a word i hated
all my life
unanticipated tears
can hurt so much
my friend
it's so sad to see you
at love's end
i've been through the pain myself
it's really wrong
to play it strong
go on and cry
'til you run dry
it's alright
go on and scream
at broken dreams
it's alright
let sorrow have it's day
and when it's done
life will go on
in time
thoughts of ""might have been""
will leave your mind
and sweet forgetfulness
will come
don't worry now
just when or how
go on and cry
'til you run dry
it's alright
go on and scream
at broken dreams
it's alright
let sorrow have it's day
to cry out
it's no crime
in no time
life will go on
go on and cry
'til you run dry
it's alright
go on and scream
at broken dreams
it's alright
let sorrow have it's day
and when it's done
life will go on and on
it's alright
yes it's alright
let sorrow have it's day
and when it's done
life will go on and on"
"new york winter traffic squeals
the city feels...so old
late december taxi ride
then run inside it's cold
got your letters monday
i think or tuesday
i lose track
since then i've been thinking of you
and i've been looking back to
london
can you believe it's so many years since
london
hitching a ride and carrying knapsacks
london
in the park by the thames drinking tea
london
sitting in pubs and living in walk ups
london
learnin' the accent learnin' to love you
london
we were young we were sure
we were... free
was it really ages
ago the memories never fade
can you hear big ben where you are
and are you glad you stayed in
london
dodging the rain with broken umbrellas
london
readind the times on saturday picnics
london
counting stars â€˜till the stars
all were gone
london
so many plans and nothing but time in
london
nothing to fear 'cause nothing could last in
london
we grew close we grew scared
i moved on
oh london
what were we scared of
why did i run from london
part of me still has
never come back from london
is it fair that i miss
you so much
take good care all my love
keep in touch
new york winter taxi ride"
"your eyes are sad eyes
mine are too
it doesn't take too much to see
what we've been through
you lost your baby
and me the same
ain't it true how love's a hurtin' game
could i have this dance
may i be so bold
it's just my arms are empty
and the night is so cold
wouldn't it be fine bein' lonely together
wouldn't it be fine havin' a shoulder to share
you could tell me how he broke your heart
and i'll tell you how she broke mine
and maybe later on i could take you home
now wouldn't it be sad bein' lonely all alone
a heart that's hurtin's
not hard to see
i guess he promised you the world
like she did me
but dry your eyes now
you'll be just fine
we can drown our achin' hearts
in this glass of wine
well i hate to say
what's done is done
it's just two can ease the pain
much better than one
chorus
love
it's such a crazy thing
all you got to give and no regrets
but love
it can live again
stay with me tonight
i'll make it work out right"
"on the day i was born
set me father said he
i've got an elegant legacy waiting for me
it's a rhyme for your lips
it's a song for your heart
to sing it whenever the world falls apart
look, look , look to the rainbow
follow it over the hills and stream
look, look, look to the rainbow
follow the fellow who follows our dream
it was a sumptuous gift
to beguile to a child
or the lore of that song kept her feet running wild
for you never grow old
and you never stand still
with whisper will singing beyond the next hill
look, look , look to the rainbow
follow it over the hills and stream
look, look, look to the rainbow
follow the fellow who follows a dream
strike one me heart and i roam the world free
to the east with a lark
to the west with the sea
and i searched all the earth
and i scanned all the sky
but i found it at last
in my own true love's eyes
look, look , look to the rainbow
follow it over the hills and stream
look, look, look to the rainbow
follow the fellow who follows the dream
follow the fellow
follow the fellow
follow the fellow"
"there you are
looking just the same as you did last time i touched you
and here i am
close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you
do you love him
as much as i love her
and will that love be strong
when old feelings start to stir
looks like we made it
left each other all the way
to another love
looks like we made it
or i thought so till today
until you were there, everywhere
and all i could taste was love the way we made it
love's so strange
playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
and we're the fools
standing close enough to touch those burning memories
and if i hold you for the sake of all those times
love made us lose our minds
could i ever let you go
oh no we made it
left each other all the way
to another love
looks like we made it
or i thought so till today
until you were there, everywhere
and all i could taste was love the way we made it
ohhhhhh, we made it
looks like we made it
left each other all the way
to another love
looks like we made it

looks like we made it

"i can tell something up
you haven't touched your scotch
you've been starring out the window
now your starring at you watch
and lately that's been happening to much
i think we're losing touch
is it something that i've done
or thing i never said
it's been getting pretty quiet
there on you side of the bed
remember when we used to talk so much
i think we're losing touch
after all the love we found together
who had ever guessed ,that we could fall
after all the things we had in common
where they to common after all
won't you tell me what's wrong
i haven't got a clue
is there something we can take for this
or something we can do
together you and i have had so much
there's so much to lose"

not for a year but ever and a day
the radio and the telephone
and the movies that we know
may just be passing fancies and in time may go

together we're going a long, long way
in time the rockies may crumble, gibraltar may tumble
they're only made of clay
but our love is here to stay

never met a man i didn't like

fancy cinema stars, false avangelist

yes i'll say when i'm done
no i never met one that i didn't like
met the worst and met the best

feel what makes him what he is
what's it like inside his skin
living in the skin he's in
just like me a lump of sod
there what for the grace of god
that is a philosphy of this part time cherokee
present into king or pat and mike
folks can last but i can give up hope
spun my rope along way down the pike
never met a man i didn't like
high tone gent, bowery bum
prince of wales, working joe
pat and mike
cherokee, philosphy"
"you ask me if there'll come a time
when i grow tired of you
never my love
never my love
you wonder if this heart of mind
will lose it's desire for you
never my love
never my love
what makes you think love will end
when you know that my whole life depends on you
you say you fear i'll change my mind
i won't require of you
never my love
never my love
how can you think love will end
when i've asked you to spend your whole life with me
you say you fear i'll change my mind
i won't require of you
never my love"
"i knew the time had to come
when i'd be held under your thumb
i'm like a pawn in your hand
moved and compelled, at your command
whether it's for bad or for good
i would never change it if i could
maybe i'm right, maybe i'm wrong
maybe i'm weak, maybe i'm strong
but nevertheless i'm in love with you
maybe i'll win, maybe i'll lose
and maybe i'm in for cryin' the blues
but nevertheless i'm in love with you
somehow, i know at a glance
the terrible chances i'm taking
fine at the start, then left
with a heart that is breaking
maybe i'll live a life of regret
and maybe i'll give much more than i get
but nevertheless, i'm in love with you
in spite of all i could do
i went ahead falling for you
so if i laugh or i cry
i made my bed, that's where i'll lie
for what happens there's no excuse
i put my own head in the noose"
"when my heart is torn apart
by love i wish i had,
well, i spend my nights in the city's lights
and things don't seem so bad.
ya know the movement seems to soothe me,
and the temp takes control,
and i lose my blues
when the ne w york city rhythm fill my soul
it's the new york city rhythm
runnin' thru' my life,
the pounding beat of the city streets
that keeps mydreams alive.
i'm lost, i'm found, i'm up, i'm down,
but somehow i survive.
it's got to be the new york city
rhythm in my life,
it's got to be the new york city
rhythm in my life, in my life.
when i'm out for love or sin,
oh, it's good to be in town,
in the funky dives on the old west sid
there's always somethin' goin' down.
oh yes , i live my life with strangers,
and the danger's always there,
but when i hit broadway and it's time to play,
ya know that i don't care"
"listen
the city is singin' its night song
a city of shadows and fading starlight
mixed with bar light
listen
the empty streets echo the night song
a melody i used to think was only for the lonely
night song i hear you
now as the night disappears
but this time your blues
is music to my ears
the rumble of a train
the rustle of the wind
the rhythm of the footsteps
the blarin' of a horn
the murmur of a voice
the echo of a siren
night song!
you used to find me cryin' in my beer
now you remind me tomorrow she'll be here
she'll be here!
oh, night song
you sing of a train from new orleans
and deep in the music i hear her hummin'
now she's comin' home!
the city is singin' its night song"
"there were no violins
there were no soft guitars
hot summer love under the city stars
i was mr. dynamite
and you were my only girl
we held each other through the night
caught in a whirl
no other love
in all of the world
in all of my life
there was no other love
there was no fireside
no beaujolais for two
winter was cold but we had me and you
all the words we used to say
all the crazy plans we made
we were so naive that way
so unafraid
no other love
in all of the world
in all of my life
there was no other love
i don't know where it went
turned into yesterday
time comes and goes like music in a play
looking back i still don't know
why we ever had to end
and it's so hard letting go
of what we had then
no other love
in all of the world
in all of my life"
"wait a minute baby
i'll be right back
i just gotta talk
to a friend
for a couple of minutes
i see you looking
at the two of us
and what do you see
the oldest couple at the mayflower
esther and me
i push her in the chair
i know she'd walk
if she could
she says ""take your pills""
as if they do any good
i'll bet you think
that what you're looking
at is all we are
two old people forgetting
the way we were
sonny, no one is
what they look like
everyone's so much more
sonny, no one is
what they look like
and we're not what
you see that's for sure
you should have known her before
you should have known her before
legs she had legs
that made the guys drool
and her waist was as small
as your neck
and the face and the hair
and the rest of her
and when i look at her now
i still see her young and beautiful
she's my girl and i'm her joe
and we're not what you see
in a minute baby i'll be right back
i just got some more to say
to my young new friend here
esther just turned 80 and i'm 83
the oldest couple at the mayflower
esther and me
i knew that when i saw her
we were meant to be one
she says she didn't notice me
but don't you believe her
i'll bet you think that what you're looking at
is all we are
two old people
stumbling through the days
sonny, no one is what
they look like
everyone's so much more
sonny, no one is what
they look like
and we're not what you see
that's for sure
you should have known me before
you should have known me before
hair, i had hair the girls
loved to feel and a built
watch out joe poluka
i could see i could hear
i could run a mile
and when i dream of us now
i still see us young and beautiful
she's my girl and i'm her joe
and we're not what you see
i guess i better go now
she's my family
the oldest couple
at the mayflower
esther and me
i'll help her with her bath
and then i'll kiss her goodnight
and sometime's we dance
in the early moonlight
i'll bet you think that what
you're looking at is all we are
two old people
watching the days go by
sonny, no one is what
they look like
everyone's so much more
sonny no one is what
they look like
and we're not what you see
that's for sure"
"hard to believe
only a day
and fifteen years of hard times
flyin' away
all those dead ends
bills comin' due
then one door opens
and i walk through
why should it amaze me
i always knew
now it's for real
here and today
forget about dreamin'
it's real all the way
the world's made to order
here's how it feels
mine and i'm movin' it
now it's for real
all the way up
i'm gonna climb
been waitin' forever
and here's my time
was hungry for years
eyes on the goal
now comes the payoff
i'm on a roll
and i'm gonna own this
body and soul
now it's for real
here and today
forget about dreamin'
it's real all the way
the world's made to order
here's how it feels
mine and i'm movin' it
now it's for real
letdown be gone
runaround be gone
first time in my life
my timing's dead on!

mine and i'm movin' it
now it's for real"
"first they told me that they loved me
dressed me up in the light of gold
all they wanted was to know me
gotta get me on before i get too old
then they told me i was big time
lots of favors of limosine
this might be what they told me it would be
but i'm not sure it's what i need
not what i need now, won't you tell me
oh, my lady where's my lady
all this glory where's my lady
to share it with me
oh, to share it with me
first they told me i could love you
and then they told me never mind never mind
gotta keep those cards and letters
flowing in my friend
gotta try and have a real good
real good time now wouldn't you tell me
oh my lady where's my lady all this glory
where's my lady to share it with me
oh to share it with me
now won't you tell me
oh where's my lady all this glory
where's my lady to share it with me
to share, to share it with me"
"hey old friend
are you ok old friend
what'll you say old friend
are we or are we unique
time goes by
everything else keeps changing
you and i we get continued next week
most friends fade
or they don't make the grade
new ones are quickly made
and in a pinch, sure they'll do
but us old friends
what's to discuss old friend
here's to us
who's like us"
"grab your coat
don't forget your hat
we'll leave your worries
leave them on the doorstep
my sweet
just direct your feet
to the sun, sunny side of the street
hop bop a doddle zag
pitter pat
you know that happy tune
is my step
life's all weak
if you dig that beat
on the sunny, sunny side of the street
used to walk in the shade
with my blues on parade
what a drag old man
getting stuck in the shade
get hit, don't be afraid
move it on over"
"you're a girl after my own heart,
you know your own mind.
we are a similar kind, separate yet intertwined.
we speak with a single voice,
but now we must make a choice
whether to fall in love.
once and for all
do you really want to have someone for good?
would you stay in love forever if you could?
do you want a friend who's always standing by,
when your back's against the wall, once and for all.
we're a pair cut from the same cloth,
deep in our own souls,
alone and yet perfectly whole,
but seemingly in control.
afraid not knowing just where we are,
but knowing we've come so far,
so far that we just might make it.
once and for all, search your heart
and then i want you to decide.
is simple love enough to keep you by my side?
can we stay together through the thick and thin,
through troubles big and small,
once and for all?"
"i caught you sir
having a look at her
as she went strolling by
now didn't your heart go
boom,boom,boom,boom,boom
and didn't you sigh a sigh
i warned you sir
never to dream of her
just bid such thoughs begone
or it'll be
boom,boom,boom,boom,boom,boom,boom
boom,boom,boom,boom
from then on
for once in love with amy
always in love with amy
ever and ever fasinated by her
sets your heart a fire to stay
once you're kissed by amy
tear up your list it's amy
ply her with bon bons, poetry,and flowers
moon a million hours away
you might be quiet the fickle hearted rover
so care free and bold
who loves a girl
and later thinks it over
and just quits cold
but once in love with amy
alway in love with amy
ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her
trouble is the answer will be
that amy rather stay in love with me
da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da

"love slips away and we move on
night becomes the dawn
words tear us up just like a storm
now love is gone leaving us strangers
the morning sky fills with rain
nothing feels the same
time leaves me remembering dreams
and places we've been
and how it all changes
once when you were mine
we lived within a world all our own
once when you were mine
once there was a time"
"one man in a spotlight
one man with a song
when it came to love, he showed us how
was there ever a time he wasn't there
'til now, the voice maybe gone
but the song goes on"
"one more time as we lie by the firelight
let me hold you til you have to go away
don't let it end
let me pretend you'll stay
one more thrill
while we're still in our solitude
one more moment
i can touch you tenderly
can this be real?
doesn't it feel like a fantasy?
when the night moves on
i'm afraid you'll be gone
with no reason or rhyme
so if i borrow a bit of tomorrow
is that such a crime?
why can't we make believe
that the evening has just begun
close your eyes to the rising sun
and hold me one more time
when the night moves on
i'm afraid you'll be gone
with no reason or rhyme
so if i borrow a bit of tomorrow
is that such a crime?
why can't we make believe
that the evening has just begun
close your eyes to the rising sun"
"one of these days
one of these very ordinary days
you're gonna call my name
and i won't be there
after the days
after these very very many days
you're gonna see the light
and i won't be there
and on that day
somehow i'll find the stregth to stay away
i won't give in
i will not let myself be taken in... again
oh no my friend
one of these days
out of the blue you'll start remembering
and i won't care
'cause i won't be there
oh, and on that day
i swear i'll find the strength somehow to stay away
i won't give in
i will not let myself be taken in... again
oh no my friend
that's what i say
that's what i tell myself... i won't give in
so try it someday
and you'll see that i won't be there
no, you know, no, i won't
these day eeya eeya eeya aaa aays
i    won't be there"
"one voice singing in the darkness
all it takes is one voice
singing so they hear what's on your mind
and when you look around you'll find
there's more than one voice singing in the darkness
joining with that one voice
each and every note another octave
hands are joined and fears unlocked
if only one voice should start it on it's own
we need just one voice facing the unknown
and then that one voice would never be alone
it takes that one voice
ba ba ba da da da da ba ba ba ba ba etc...
it takes that one voice
all it takes is one voice
shout it out and let it ring
just one voice
it takes that one voice
and every one will sing"
"i went back
yes i went back to find out
what we did wrong
and i went back
yes i went back to see just
how we could feel so good
in chicago we seemed to have it all
it was real, it was real
i went back
and i sat by the lake
and looked at the stars
and oh i swear
i remember how much we laughed
and i loved you so
in chicago i know we had it all
it was real, it was love
only in chicago
love is in the air in chicago
there's a magic there in chicago
our chicago
baby, you and i, we tried to take it with us
but you can't go back
â€˜cause i went back to find out
what we did wrong and now i see
that it wasn't just you
it wasn't just you it was in chicago
but i'm still in love with you"
"lying beside you, here in the dark
feeling your heart beat with mind
softly you whisper, youre so sincere
how could our live be so blind
we sailed on together
we drifted apart
and here you are by my side
so now i come to you, with open arms
nothing to hide, believe what i say
so here i am with open arms
hoping youll see what your love means to me
open arms
living without you, living alone
this empty house seems so cold
wanting to hold you, wanting you near
how much i wanted you home
but now that youve come back
turned night into day
i need you to stay."
"the night is new
the faces are friendly
so have a few
and let me play
some new songs, some blue songs
the mood is always right
every night at the paradise cafã©
the world outside
may make its own madness
but here we hide
the world away
no headlines, no deadlines
we'll make them disappear
while you're here at the paradise cafã©
the room is kinda smokey
the phone ain't workin'
the same old broken keys don't play
but no one seems to mind it
'cause someone's buyin'
and we'll all get through one more day
just me and you around the piano
not much to do but dream away
so stay on i'll play on
i'm all yours for a song
all night long at the paradise cafã©
forget the one who loved you
then lied and left you
forget the love you almost had
but if you must remember
the way it left you
we'll make it feel good to feel bad"
"there's a light behind your eyes
i see it shining, it only fades when you cry
there's a heart that beats so strong
i feel it dying when the night time lasts too long
now you and i have lived out centuries
and all i can say is what you've offered to me
please don't be scared, cause i stood there too
between survival and the right thing to do
cause only the strong admit their fears
and if you really need me i'll always be here
the parties and the lights
fade to memories in the still of the night
and you wonder in your mind
if there's nothing left to show for all the time
cause feeling pain's a hard way
to know you're still alive
but someday someone
will make you glad you survived
please don't be scared, cause i stood there too
between survival and the right thing to do
cause only the strong admit their fears
and if you really need me i'll always be here
cause feeling pain's a hard way
to know you're still alive
but someday someone
will make you glad you survived
please don't be scared, cause i stood there too
between survival and the right thing to do
cause only the strong admit their fears
and if you really need me i'll always be here
no matter where you are"
"put your dreams away for another day
and i will take their place in your heart
wishing on a star never got you far
and so it's time to make a new start
when your dreams at night
fade before you
then i'll have the right
to adore you
let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling"
"i know i'd go from rages to riches
if you would only say you care
and though my pocket may be empty
i'd be a millionaire
my clothes may still be torn and tattered
but in my heart i'd be a king
your love is all that ever mattered
it's everything
so open your arms and you'll open the door
to every treasure i'm hoping for
hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore
must i forever be a begger
whose golden dreams will not come true
or will i go from rags to riches
my fate is up to you
must i forever be a begger
whose golden dreams will not come true
or will i go from rags to riches
my fate is up to you"
"grey clouds rollin' over my head
i can see a storm in the sky
all night long you're tossin' in bed
all night long i'm outa my head it's
rain, fallin' down from the sky
kissin' my love goodbye
rain fallin down
i can't take the rain
washin' my love away
i'm cryin' for yesterday
rain fallin' down
grey clouds rollin' over my head
i can see a storm in the sky
don't know where this lovin' has led
why can't there be sun instead of rain
fallin' down from the sky
kissin' my love goodbye
rain fallin down
i can't take the rain

"i've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say
i thought i'd leave you with a letter or fiery speech
like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play
and i've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
i'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away
i'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant
well i could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around
with just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
we started out with a bang and at the top of the world
now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
and everything's blank
chorus:
if i could find the words then i would write it all down
if i could only find a voice i would speak
oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight
come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
chorus
i've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up to a scream
we let the past slip away, and put the future on hold
now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream
and i've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
i'd like to know why you faded and you threw it away
i'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant
well i could tell you good bye or maybe see you around
with just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
but now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks, and everything's blank
chorus
it's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
it's running silent and angry and deep
it's there in my eyes and it's all i can say
come on and read 'em and weep
   for all the hours we'll be spending alone
   for the dreams we'll ignore
and all those promises we promised to keep, they won't be kept anymore
   for the magic that our bodies had made
   for the blood that we lost
and all the secrets that we somehow betrayed
for whatever the cost
   for the memories still alive in the bed
   for the lies we believed
and all the things that can never be said
why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep
come on and look at me and read 'em and weep
it's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
it's running silent and angry and deep
it's here in my eyes and it's all i can say"
"pardon me miss
but i've never done this
with a real live girl
what could be harmful
in holding an armful
of a real live girl
pardon me if you're affectionate squeeze
fogs up my goggles and
buckels my knees
i'm simply drown in the sight, and the sounds,
and the scent and the feel
of a real live girl
nothing can beat getting swept off your feet
by a real live girl
dreams of you but don't compare with a hunk
of a real live girl
girl's were to girlish
was once my belief
whata reversal and what a relief
i'll take the flowering hat
and the towering hill
and the squeal of a real live girl
i've seen photographs and faximilies
that have set my heart off in a whirl
but i over look everyone in the book
for a real live girl
take your vernecion or romanaprrection
ideal live girl
go be a hold out for helen of troy
i am a healthy american boy
and i rather gape at the dear little shape of the stir
and the kill of a real live girl"
"friday night it was late
i was walking you home
we got down to the gate
and i was dreaming of the night
would it turn out right
how to tell you girl
i want to build my world around you
tell you that it's true
i wanna make you understand
i'm talking about a life time plan
that's the way it began
we were hand in hand
glen miller's band was better than before
we yelled and screamed for more
and the porter too
made us dance across the room
it ended it all too soon
and on the way back home
i promise you, you'll never be alone
hurry don't be late
i can hardly wait
i said to myself when we're old
we'll go dancing in the dark
walking through the park and reminiscing
friday night it was late
i was walking you home
we got down to the gate
and i was dreaming of the night
would it turn out right
now as the years roll on
each time we hear our favorite song
the memories come along
older times we're missing
spending the hours reminiscing
hurry don't be late
i can hardly wait
i said to myself when we're old
we'll go dancing in the dark
walking through the park and reminiscing
we'll go dancing in the dark
walking through the park and reminiscing
you should be dancing
dancing
dancing
dancing"

"it's coming on christmas
they're cutting down trees
they're putting up reindeer
and signing songs of joy and peace
oh i wish i had a river
i could skate away on
but it don't snow here
it stays pretty green
i'm going to make a lot of money
then i'm going to quit this crazy scene
oh i wish i had a river
i could skate away on
i wish i had a river so long
i would teach my feet to fly
i wish i had a river
i could skate away on
i made my baby cry
well she tried hard to help me
you know, she put me at ease
and she loved me so naughty
made me weak in the knees
oh i wish i had a river
i could skate away on
i'm so hard to handle
i'm selfish and i'm sad
now i've gone and lost the best baby
that i ever had
oh i wish i had a river
i could skate away on
i wish i had a river so long
i would teach my feet to fly
i wish i had a river
i could skate away on
i made my baby say goodbye
well it's coming on christmas
they're cutting down trees
they're putting up reindeer
singing songs of joy and peace
god i wish i had a river
i could skate away on"
"you know dasher and dancer, and prancer and vixen
comet and cupid, and donner and blitzen
but do you recall, the most famous reindeer of all?
rudolph the red nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose
and if you ever saw it
you could even say it glows
all of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call him names
they never let poor rudolph
join in any reindeer games
then one foggy christmas eve
santa came to say
""rudolph with your nose so bright
won't you guide my sleigh tonight? ""
then how the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee
""rudolph the red nosed reindeer
you'll go down in history. """
"she's a great little housewife
though sometimes she talks like a fool
but she helps at the store in the holiday rush
and she picks up the kids after school
and she puts down the phone
when her husband comes home
and she changes from mother to wife
'til she feels the words hanging between them
and she hangs by her words to her life
she says i swear i love my husband,
i love my kids
i wanted to be like my mother
but if i hadn't done it as soon as i did
oh there might have been time to be me
for myself, for myself
there's so many things that she wishes
she don't even know what she's missin'
and that's how she knows that she missed
she's a sweetheart, except when she's moody
it's hard to get through to her then
depressed for a while
when the youngest was born
oh but that happens now and again
she might take a drink with the housework
or when michael's kept late at the shop
a martini or two before dinner
but she always knows when to stop
she says i swear i love my husband
and i love my kids
you know i wanted to be like my mother
but if i hadn't done it as soon as i did
oh there might have been time to be me
for myself, for myself
there's so many things that she wishes
she don't even know what she's missin'
and that's how she knows that she missed
oh they used to hold hands at the movies
now it's seldom if ever they go
once you've paid for the sitter
and parkin' the car
there's no money left for the show
she was doing the dishes
when a glass fell and broke on the tile
and she cut her wrist it was real touch and go for a while
she says oh god i love my husband
and i love my kids
you know i wanted to be like my, my mother
but if i hadn't done it as soon as i did
oh there might have been time to be me
for myself, for myself
there's so many things that she wishes

she sings her troubled songs.
she's a star

and what it costs, she oughta know
she said she'd do it she's a star
they're hangin' on her music
as it fills the concert hall

yeah, she likes to leave 'em hungry,
yeah she loves to hear 'em yell!

four walls
guess you all went away
an hour ago we were laughing
lovers and friends
maybe that was yesterday

did i miss something real?
when i slept through the end of the world
nobody answers at all
i call
and there's nobody there
how long since i've lifted my head now
crawled out of bed
how long since anyone cared?
so now i lose?
lie alone in the blues?
cause i slept through the end of the world
losing is a story i remember
alone is a feeling that i know
been awhile since losing shook me
took me down so low
yes it has
how could this ride be all over?
four walls are all i see
i'm tellin' the shadows and echoes
shoulda told you
but i was wrapped up in me

gettin' used to too late

of a restless harbor

that all you can think about
is letting go

at the wrong time
guess i always knew inside
i wouldn't have you for a long time
those dreams of yours
are shining on distant shores
and if they're calling you away
i have no right to make you stay,
but somewhere down the road
our roads are gonna cross again
it doesn't really matter when
but somewhere down the road
i know that heart of yours
will come to see
that you belong with me
sometimes goodbyes are not forever
it doesn't matter if you're gone
i still believe in us together
i understand more than you think i can
you have to go out on your own
so you can find your way back home
* and somewhere down the road
letting go is just another way to say
i'll always love you so
we had the right love
at the wrong time
maybe we've only just begun
maybe the best is yet to come"
"time...
you found time enough to love
and i found love enough to hold you
so tonight..
i'll stir the fire you feel inside
until the flames of love enfold you
laying beside you, lost in the feeling
so glad you opened my door
come with me..
somewhere in the night we will know
everything lovers can know
you're my song..
music too magic to end
i'll play you over and over again
loving so warm..
moving so right..
closing our eyes and feeling alive
we'll just go on burning bright
somewhere in the night
you'll sleep..
when the morning comes
and i'll lie and watch you sleeping
and you'll smile..
when you dream about the night
like it's a secret you've been keeping
laying beside you lost in the feeling
so glad you opened my door
you're my song
music too magic to end
i'll play you over and over again
loving so warm..
moving so right..
closing our eyes and feeling alive
we'll just go on burning bright
somewhere in the night
we'll just go on burning bright

"i know there's someone,
somewhere,
someone,
who's sure to find me soon,
after the rain goes,
there are rainbows,
i'll find my rainbow soon,
soon it won't be just pretend,
soon a happy ending,
love can you hear me,
if you're near me,
sing your song,
sure and strong and soon"
"and now the purple dusk of twilight time
steals across the meadows of my heart
high up in the sky the little stars climb
always reminding me that we're apart
you wandered down the lane and far away
leaving me a song that will not die
love is now the stardust of yesterday
the music of the years gone by
sometimes i wonder why i spend
the lonely night dreaming of a song
the melody haunts my reverie
and i am once again with you
when our love was new
and each kiss an inspiration
but that was long ago
now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
beside a garden wall
when stars are bright you are in my arms
the nightingale tells his fairy tale
of paradise where roses grew
though i dream in vain
in my heart it will remain
my stardust melody
the memory of love's refrain
though i dream in vain
in my heart it will remain
my stardust melody"
"look
look at the stars
how brilliant they are
how can they be shining now
when hope seems so far?
look
look how they shine
these cruelest of stars
what promise inspires them?
what faith is it fires them?
darkness grows
the world turns cold
and still there glows the light
heaven knows
what hope they hold tonight
look
look how they tease
these stars in the night
the darker the night becomes
the brighter their light becomes
chill winds wail
the tempest brews
and clouds assail the sky
through the veil
the stars refuse to die!
in this world
of darkest night
where hope is hurled away
there they are
and still there's light
oh so far
but will they...?
dare they lift our hearts
as we lift our eyes
are we fools to see
the hope that's gleaming in the skies?
look!
there's the light!
stars in the night!"
"and it started again
and i meant every word
and i like what i said
and i liked what i heard
and i started to think
i could think about starting again
we where laughing again
over memories and wine
and the years in between
didn't seem along time
when i smile she knew why
in awhile it was starting again
and i started to think
i could feel again
all the bad times seemed unreal
when she looked in my eyes
the cheating , the lies , the things that where wrong
seem far behind
and i started to think
i could care again
and my fears all disapper
when she called me by name
i knew that she changed
the flaws where all gone
the saint remained
but it started again
when i asked her to stay
and she said there's this friend who's in town just for today
and she really felt bad
but she had to be leavin again
and she left me again
as she left me before
still pretending she cared when we kissed at the door
but i saw in her eyes
that the lies where all starting again
just when i'd started to fell again
when all the bad times seemed unreal
when it all seemed so right
and i tough that tonight if she said she cared
she really might
just when my fears disapeared again
and i heard what i wanted to hear
it all started again
and i knew what that meant
it wasn't the start"
"do you remember how we used to be
before we lost the dream of you and me
from the very start you took my breath away
so tonight let's bring back yesterday
darlin' stay
why don't you be with me tonight
stay
we can make love till the morning light
baby stay
i can make everything alright
just tell me what to say
'cause i really don't want you to go
you used to laugh and say sweet things to me
you made me happy as a man can be
hold me in your arms like you did then
make the memory live all over again
darlin' stay
why don't you be with me tonight
stay
we can make love till the morning light
baby stay
i can make everything alright
just tell me what to say"

"strangers in the night exchanging glances
wond'ring in the night
what were the chances we'd be sharing love
before the night was through.
something in your eyes was so inviting,
something in you smile was so exciting,
something in my heart,
told me i must have you.
strangers in the night, two lonely people
we were strangers in the night
up to the moment
when we said our first hello.
little did we know
love was just a glance away,
a warm embracing dance away and
ever since that night we've been together.
lovers at first sight, in love forever.
it turned out so right,
for strangers in the night.

"i am a studio musician,
we've never met,
but you know me well.
i am the english horn,
who plays the poignant counterline
upon the song you heard
while making love in some hotel.
i am a part of you,
i've never tried for fame,
you'll never know my name.
i am the strings that enter softly,
or three guitars
that glitter gold.
i am the thousand trumpet lines
that were an afterthought,
intended as a way
to get a dying record sold.
i never ride the road,
i never play around,
i play what they set down.
i'm a working musician,
living from week to week,
i'm the voice through which empty men try to speak.
a studio musician,
blowin' the chance i seek.
and when the woodwind cushion rises,
i start to dream,
on a low brass bed,
but i awake to horns,
the drummer calls to me,
we're up to letter d.
i'm a man of the moment,
pop is my stock and trade,
singles, jingles, and demos,
conveniently made.
a studio musician,
whose music will die unplayed.
a studio musician,"
"it was one of those summer's
lasting forever
making the winter wait
a summer of music and passion
the summer of '78
you appeared like the summer
sudden and perfect
and not a day too late
i swear there was music when i found you
that summer of '78
it seem we floated through the days
and nights were always filled with stars
and it seemed every song they played on the radio
was ours
it was one of those summer's
only for lovers
touched by the hand of faith
and now when the winter's are long"
"the summer wind, came blowin' in
from across the sea
it lingered there, to touch you hair
and walk with me
all summer long, we sang a song
and strolled the golden sand
two sweethearts, and the summer wind
like painted kites, the days and nights went flyin' by
the world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
then softer than, a piper man one day it called to you
and i lost you, to the summer wind
the autumn wind, and the winter winds have come and gone
and still the days, the lonely days go on and on
and guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
well my fickle friend, the summer wind
that old summer wind
talkin' 'bout the summer wind"

"hand in his hands through the park
all afternoon
a fine day to fly balloons or tell him a story
hand in his hand to wonder
till day is done
sunday father and son
sundays are theirs to explore
alone by law
one day to keep the two from turning to strangers,
one to know the answers
be firm, be fun
sunday father and son
the father weaves through the weekend streets
sunday alone, monday comin&acute;on
he leaves the child by a modest home
that they share no more
with the woman who waits indoors
till she knows he's gone
where are the words or the games
a place to go
someway to let him know you want to be with him
somehow it's always ending
just half begun
sunday father and son"
"and so it began
as i sat by my window
all by myself in the dawn
no body else
no polite conversation
just waiting for life to come on
and i see the sunrise over the ocean
sunrise on the sea
i'm watching the sunrise
i'm glad to be living
sunrise , shine over me
i think of my life as i look out my window
people i love , places i've been
sometimes i feel i could go on forever
with nothing to lose and nothing to win
when i see the sunrise over the ocean
sunrise on the sea
i'm watching the sunrise
i'm glad to be living"

sweet heaven i'm in love again
so totally in love again

i'll sing it on the radio
i want the whole world to know"

"it's raining down sorrow and nothing but bad news
you know i've had it up to here
living with these blues
but i won't let it get me down,
it's not the only game in town
in my mind, i'm goin to swing street
i'm a dreamer on a rough road
and i need to hear the music once again
when there's nothing but bad news,
i've got a way to beat the blues
i close my eyes, and i go to swing street
we can dance there, there's a chance there
of finding a little romance there
you don't know who you'll meet
when you're down on swing street
lose your blues in a minute
cop a groove and you're in it
i'm tellin you once, i'm tellin you twice
better take my advice
if you're weepin and you're wailin'
i've got a cure to fix exactly what is ailin,
count to four and grab my hand
say i'll meet you by the band
you and i, we're goin' to swing street
give yourself to the rhythm
and every wrong is forgiven
you may even lose the bluest of blues
get back on your feet
when your best friends turn to strangers
and one more workin' day
don't seem worth all the changes
just reach out and take my hand
and i'll meet you by the band
you and i, we're goin' to swing street
yes you and i, we're going to go"
"after it was over, after the crying
and all the angry shouting
when we'd both just given up
and you turned and closed the door
i didn't know what was wrong
anymore than i did before
maybe it was over
when you stopped trying
or when i started doubting
maybe you don't care enough
maybe i'm just scared you'll go
but maybe what was really wrong
is that i still don't really know
talk to me quietly, peacefully
tell me what to do
talk to me honestly, don't you see
i need to talk to you
i need to hear that we're okay
and say the things that i meant to say
so talk to me before
before it's really over
when it all was starting
when i first met you
we couldn't keep from talking
i knew everything you felt
and i felt you knew me too
now i'm talking to myself
or i'm just yelling back at you
how this could have happened
how i could lose you
or you could think to leave me
after where we started from
i'm too dumb i guess to see
but you can't go 'till i do
and you know
you owe that to me
talk to me quietly, peacefully
i don't wanna fight
talk to me nice and slow
so i'll know
how to make it right
i'm not afraid to take the blame
i'm just afraid we'll stay the same
and we won't talk until
until it's really over
i don't understand
why you're always mad
what could i have done
what could be so bad
don't you wanna know
why i never sleep
look what we've become
from all these secrets that we keep
when it's really over
'cause i can't take it
or you've walked out
for the last time
when these years are just a dream
and these tears somehow have dried
i can't wake up in my bed
and regret what we never tried
so please don't say it's over
don't even think it
just think about the good times
think of all we've got to lose
and not who's done what to who
and when it comes time to chose
think of who would still die for you
talk to me quietly, peacefully
make me understand
say what you need to say
find a way
take me by the hand
the only thing i ask of you
is please, for once, just listen too
and talk to me before
before it's really over
talk to me
before it's really over"
"did you say that i've got a lot to learn
well don't think i'm trying not to learn
since this is the perfect spot to learn
teach me tonight
starting with the abc of it
getting right down to the xyz of it
help me solve the mystery of it
teach me tonight
the sky's a blackboard high above you
and if a shooting star goes by
i'll use that star to write ""i love you""
a thousand times across the sky
one thing isn't very clear my love
teachers shouldn't stand so near my love
graduation's almost here my love
you'd better teach me tonight
i've played loves scenes in a flick or two
and i've also met a chick or two
but i still can learn a trick or two
hey teach me tonight
i who thought i knew the score of it
kind of think i should know much more of it
off the wall, the bed, the floor of it
hey teach me tonight
the midnight hours come slowly creeping
when there's no one there but you
there must be more to life than sleeping
single in a bed for two
what i need most is post graduate
what i feel is hard to articulate
if you want me to matriculate
you'd better teach me tonight
what do you get for lessons
teach me... come on and teach me... teach me tonight"
"if i could make a wish
i think i pass
can't think of any thing i need
no cigarettes,no sleep
no light,no sound
nothing to eat
no books to read
making love with you
has made me peaceful
warm,and tired
what more could i ask
their nothing left to be desire
sometimes, all i need is the
air that i breath
and to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
yes to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
peace came apond me
and it leaves me weak
sleep silent angel
go to sleep
sometimes, all i need is this
air that i breathe
and to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
yes to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
all i need is the air that i breathe
all i need is the air that i breathe"
"the bells of christmas
the bells of christmas
are ringing in the night
the chrildren string there lights upond the tree
the bells of christmas
they sing to me tonight
bring back thoughts of you and me
central park
slideing round in the snow
and then after dark
filling the fires burning glow
the bells of christmas
they ring of what could be
for the bells of christmas
they ring for you and me
sunday walks watching ships in the bay
midnight talks we voul
we never let love slip away
the bells of christmas
they ring of what could be
for the bells of christmas
the bells of christmas
the bells of christmas
they ring for you and me"
"chestnuts roasting on a open fire
jack frost nipping at your nose
yuletide carols being sung by a choir

will find it hard to sleep tonight

he's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

many ways
merry christmas to you

candles gleaming inside
painted candy canes on the tree

things for you and me

merry christmas
may your new year dreams come true
and this song of mine
in three quarter time
wishes you and yours
the same thing too"
"in april weather
when the meadow was bloomin'
we walk together
to the top of the hill
upon the clover
when the meadow was bloomin'
we dreamed together
just us true lovers will
but summer flies on
far across the horizon
and winter lies on
over the valley and hills
do you remember
when the meadow was bloomin'
in bleak december
do you think of me still
but summer flies on
far across the horizon
and winter lies on
over the valley and hills
do you remember
when the meadow was bloomin'
in bleak december
do you think of me still
do you remember"
"there's a kid inside
and i have him with me always
there's a kid inside
walking down old high school hallways
there's a kid inside
at a desk, at a dance, in the halls,in the showers
there's a kid inside
to this very day
and he makes a try for that high pop fly
that i fumble one september
and he makes a fuss
over some a plus
that i shouldn't still remember
and he goes along
getting hurt,getting mad,fighting fights that are over
and unless i'm strong
all my senses are carried away
i could fell my hand
my tremblin hand
on the shelf angora sweather
i can hear my band
that awful band,only now it sounds much better
i can see the kid
the kid i use to be
on the stage,on the field,on the lunch line
i can feel him tugging at me
every time i think i don't care i blink
and he's there again
he's there again
fighting ancient wrongs
humming old hit songs in my head
singing come along,come along
come along for the ride
to a time and place
i could not forget if i tried
and i never know when the breeze'll blow
with a rush of old sensation
why the kid should wake
and my heart should ache
everytime i smell carnations
something rings the bell
any thing at all
all it takes is a slam of a locker
of the switch from summer or fall
a change in season
seems better than reason
but there he goes
he's there again
fighting ancient wrong
humming old hit songs in my head
singing come along, come along
come along for the ride
to a time and place
i could not for get if i try
there he goes again
hummin his songs
he's there again
there's a kid inside
hummin his songs
he's there again"

the crowd was hangin' in the neighborhood
everybody there was lookin' so cool
everyone was feelin' so good
now, mister puente
they said he'd be here by ten thirty
said he was comin' back to his roots again
to finds some old friends
the night that tito played
my life forever changed
i felt my heart and soul come alive
i felt it all
movin' and swayin' under the moon
prayin' to the rhythm of a puente tune
the night that tito played
nothin' was ever the same
there was romona
she came uptown from corona
right there on the stairway of the subway train
we danced real slow
she whispered secrets
the way she kissed me it was perfect
we held on in the shadows of the city lights
oh, it felt so right
the night that tito played
my life forever changed
i felt my heart and soul come alive
i felt it all
movin' and swayin' under the moon
prayin' to the rhythm of a puente tune
the night that tito played
nothin' was ever the same

my life forever changed

"so you have finally made up your mind
take one last look at who you're leaving behind
we lost the ending we were too late
but we took time enough to devastate
when people never say things
they lead themselves astray
chorus:
oh oh oh
the one that got away
gave me everything
i never had
oh oh
the one that got away
gave me everything i never
i had no problems you had no doubts
we were the ones they used to talk about
we saw no windows we had no door
i used to wonder what the shouting's for
when people never say things
they watch their love decay
repeat chorus
when loves take it too far
they bow their heads and say
repeat chorus
one that got away "
"love is lovelier, the second time around
just as wonderful, with both feet on the ground
it's that second time you hear your love song sung
makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
love's more comfortable the second time you fall
like a friendly home the second time you call
who can say, what led us to this miracle we've found
there are those who'd bet
love comes but once   and yet
i'm oh so glad we met
the second time around
who can say, what led us to this miracle we've found
there are those who'd bet
love comes but once   and yet
i'm oh so glad we met
the second time around

i need you, oh my darling, like roses need rain
you ask how long i'll love you
i'll tell you true until the twelfth of never
i'll still be loving you
hold me close, never let me go
hold me close, melt my heart like april snow
i'll love you 'til the bluebells forget to bloom
i'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume
i'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme
until the twelfth of never and that's a long, long time
until the twelfth of never and that's a long, long time"
"now, we're happy to sit,
day after day the two of us
wasting away, making believe
there's a reason to stay together
now, we're happy to sit,
night after night the two of us
conviced that it's right, hiding the yawns
somehow getting along together
afraid we'd always be alone
we made a home that we could always share
just to know that someone would be there
even if we never learned to care
and now, it's almost enough,
year after year the two of us
nothing to fear, nothing at all"

yes at night
night is when they
go to town!

ginger rogers

he's got the flair
of fred astaire
they dance!
as they glide
around the ballroom
they dance!
and the world
belongs to them
when they dance!
nobody knows that
she has this secret
none of her family

"there's a women in this town
drowning in a river of her own tears
crying for a man who's name she can't remember
cause it's been to many years
made up her mind
the day he left her behind
she'd never find a man like him again
so she closed the door
and never looked any more
so of course she's been alone since then
she gave in to the blues
so you know she just had to lose
soon as she gave in to the blues
there's a man who won't try to ask her why
he says only fools even play the game
never have the breaks, the money that it takes
so he says he's not to blame
started to drink , the day he started to think
the world was out to bring him down for good
so he close the door and drank a little bit more
and went down just like they said he would
he gave in to the blues
so you know he just had to lose
soon as he give in to the blues
they give in to the blues

love is what's true
the rest is illusion
what i've discovered with you

still you are there
you aren't real

to haunt and surround me
you're everywhere
both:
this isn't true
it's only illusion
what i've discovered with you
is just an ideal
barry:
this must be a dream, i know
so why do i want you so?
is it because

"i know, bobby, i see
the times are awful, true
but they're times that we inherit
what else can we do?
the choices pal, are few
roll over, die, or rise above it all
show 'em why and how to shove it all!
i know, bobby
i see
this is our time, bobby, this is our time
bad times, so then what's to lose?
a lousy year of lousy news
and stuffin' cardboard in our shoes
when here's a chance to know what bliss is
it's our dance, hey fellas
this is our time!
sad as hell
but our time
our world
if the world survives
then we've got time and bobby
just maybe it could be
the time of all times of our lives!
help it happen
draw the plan
you can't do it
nor can i
but bobby
we can!
this is our time
maybe it's the last time
who knows, but at least it's ours
and it won't be the first time
that men picked the worst time
to lift up their eyes to the stars!
'cause it's our time!
here's to our time!
this is our time!
and it won't be the first time
that men picked the worst time

"lying in my bed i hear the clock tick,
and think of you
caught up in circles confusion  
is nothing new
flashback  warm nights  
almost left behind
suitcases of memories,
time after  
sometimes you picture me  
i'm walking too far ahead
you're calling to me, i can't hear
what you've said  
then you say  go slow  
i fall behind  
the second hand unwinds
chorus:
if you're lost you can look  and you will find me
time after time
if you fall i will catch you  i'll be waiting
time after time
after my picture fades and darkness has
turned to gray
watching through windows  you're wondering
if i'm ok
secrets stolen from deep inside
the drum beats out of time  
chorus:
if you're lost...
you said go slow  
i fall behind
the second hand unwinds  
chorus:
if you're lost...
...time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time"

is comin' back home late today
coudja maybe give me somethin' ?
'cause the feeling is gone and i must get it back right away
before she sees that
i've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again

made my knees start to quiver
every time she walked in
and i've looked high , low everywhere i possibly can but there's no  tryin' to get the feelin' again
it seemed to disappear as fast as it came
where did it run to? i thought i'd done all that i could
just to keep the love light burnin'

maybe be a movie star

twenty four hours a day

i was gonna save the human race

is the life i've lived before

i never dreamed that i would see the day that i would find
a love that feels so right, but here we are tonight
and now the only thing we really need is time
we live on borrowed time
no one can be sure when the loan will finally come due
but i'm loving all of mine, i know what time is for,
i've borrowed it so i can spend it all right here with you
there was a time when i believed that life held guarantees
there was a time when i was sure my future was secure,
but life had other plans, the future's in god's hands
and knowing that just makes me love you even more
we live on borrowed time
yesterday is past, tomorrow seems a million miles away
but i promise you that i'm gonna make love last
by living every moment, every hour, every day
now we may have a year, or we may have a lifetime,
no one can be certain what the future will allow,
but you and i are here, and this time is the right time
'cause one thing that i know is that we have each other now, and now,
and we live on borrowed time
let's celebrate and sing as we walk bravely into the unknown
'cause we're gonna be just fine, whatever life may bring,
we'll face it all together and we'll never be alone
we'll face it all together and we'll never be alone"

time to try

passes by
we've got to take it
and maybe stumble and fall
but we still have time
to have it all
i don't have all the answers
i don't know where we'd start
i don't know how
we'd try to find a way
i only know
that now i need to hear you say
that we still have time
time to try
yes we still have time
before the chance
passes by

it's not so bad you know.
it's just another night,

it's not the first,
it's not the worst you know,

we'll get through this.
we've made mistakes,
but we've made good friends too.
remember all the nights we spent with them?
and all our plans,
who says they can't come true?

just fine.
we're not alone, we've got the world you know.
and it won't let us down, just wait and see.
and we'll grow old, but think how wise we'll grow.

look at the stars
so far away
we've got tonight
who needs tomorrow
we've got tonight babe
why don't you stay
deep in my soul
i've been so lonely
all of my hopes
fading away

after today

"we've only just begun to live
white lace and promises
a kiss for luck and we're on our way
and yes, we've just begun
before the rising sun we fly
so many roads to choose
we start our walking and learn to run
and yes, we've just begun
sharing horizons that are new to us
watching the signs along the way
talking it over just the two of us
working together day to day
together
and when the evening comes we smile
so much of life ahead
we'll find a place where there's room to grow
and yes, we've just begun"
"last night, i waved goodbye
now it seems years,
i'm back in the city, where nothing is clear,
and thoughts of me, holding you, bringing us near,
and tell me;
when will our eyes meet,
when can i touch you,
when will this strong yearning end,
and when will i hold you again.
time in new england took me away,
to long rocky beaches, and you, by the bay,
we started a story who's end must now wait
and tell me;
when will our eyes meet,
when can i touch you,
when will this strong yearning end,
and when can i hold you again....
i feel the change comin'
i feel the wind blow,
i feel brave and darin'
i feel my blood flow,
with you i can bring out all the love that i have,
with you...there's a heaven
so earth ain't so bad,
and tell me.....
when will our eyes meet,
when can i touch you,
when will this string yearning end,
and when can i hold you again....again."
"in my life
i have seen
far away places
wild and serene
but nothing i saw
prepared me for
the mat on the floor
saying ""welcome home""
time flies
see the moon rise
as i'm makin' my way
through another long day
but i'll go
to a place i know
in my heart i know
there's just no place
like home
welcome home
welcome home
to that place
that's safe and warm
always a shelter
from the storm
i'm going home
welcome home
roll out the welcome mat
for me!
i'm goin' home
sometimes
i remember
all the days i never knew
if i would ever make it through
but just when
i'd give up again
i'd remember when the days
were stormy
home was always
waitin' for me
sayin'
welcome home
welcome home
where there will always be
a welcoming light on
just for me
when i go home
welcome home
no place
that i would rather be
than goin' home
in my heart i know
that someday when my time
is drawing near
i'm gonna hear
welcome home
welcome home
where there will always be
somebody waiting
there for me
when i go home
home sweet home
everyone's smilin' just for me
when i go home
in my heart i see
somebody waiting
there for me
welcome home
welcome home
it looks like a
starlight symphony"
"what am i doin' here
alone in this lonely house
this house that we dreamed about
this house we shared till you walked out
what am i doin' here
this place ain't no good for me
it just brings back memories
and the last things i need is memories
i should be movin' on
wath am i doin' here
now that you've really gone
why can't i dry these tears
but oh, the years we had
here is this house that we both loved so madly
i've never been like this
just livin' in yesterdays
but there&acute;s so much i miss
and so much that i still can't face
if there&acute;s a chance for me
i just can&acute;t see it now
all i see is what can&acute;t be"
"when the bells all ring,
and the horns all blow,
and the couples we know
are fondly kissing.
will i be with you,
or will i be among the missing?
maybe it's much too early in the game,
ah, but i thought i'd ask you just the same,
what are you doing new year's, new year's eve?
wonder who's arms will hold you good and tight,
when it's exactly 12 o'clock that night,
new year's, new year's eve.
maybe i'm crazy to suppose,
i'd ever be the one you chose,
out of a thousand invitations you'll receive.
ah, but in case i stand one little chance,
here comes the jackpot question in advance,
what are you doing new year's, new year's eve?
out of a thousand invitations you'll receive,
ah, but in case i stand one little chance,
here comes the jackpot question in advance,

"when i need you
i just close my eyes
and i'm with you
and all that i so want to give you
it's only a heart beat away
when i need love
i hold out my hands
and i touch love
i never knew there was so much love
keeping me warm night and day
miles and miles of empty space
in between us
a telephone can't take the place of your smile
but you know i won't be traveling forever
it's cold out, but hold out
and do like i do
when i need you
i just close my eyes
and i'm with you
and all that i so want to give you
it's only a heart beat away
it's not easy when
the road is your driver
honey that's a heavy load that we bare
but you know i won't be
traveling a life time
it's cold out but hold out
and do like i do
oh i need you
when i need love
i hold out my hands
and i touch love
i never knew there was so much love
keeping me warm night and day
when i need you
i just close my eyes
and you're right here by my side
keeping me warm night and day
i just hold out my hands
i just hold out my hands

"tho' we're going our separate ways
there can only be brighter days
'cause i didn't mean that much to you
work it out, don't lose the fight
you can make it turn out right
'cause you've got the heart to be secure
when i wanted you i needed you
and i still can't bring myself to say i'm over you
when i gave you time to make up your mind
you turned you back on me
and now i've got to turn my back on you
after all that we've been through
leavin' you is so hard to do
but when i close my eyes i don't feel the pain
what was wrong and who was right
in the end you see the light
'cause you think a lot when you're on your own
when i wanted you
i needed you
and i still can't bring myself to say i'm over you
when i gave you time to make up your mind
you turned you back on me
and now i'm turnin' mine on you
now you're on your own
how does it feel
to feel the way i used to feel"
"when love is gone
what good is candlelight
each lonely day
becomes a sleepless night
no one is there to share the rising dawn
and so it fades away when love is gone
when love is gone
life's just a hollow shell
the stars don't shine
the moon has lost its spell
that old familiar ache
that makes the night so long
just seems to linger on when love is gone
when love is gone
there's just the memories
an empty heart where love once used to be
those lonely blues refuse to let you carry on"
"and when october goes
the snow begins to fly
above the smokey roofs
i watch the planes go by
the children running home
beneath a twilight sky
oh, for the fun of them
when i was one of them
and when october goes
the same old dream appears
and you are in my arms
to share the happy years
i turn my head away
to hide the helpless tears
oh how i hate to see october go
i should be over it now i know
it doesn't matter much
how old i grow
i hate to see october go"
"every rainbow has to have an end
a pot of gold or dreams foretold
may not be there my friend
in this high and mighty world we live in
sometimes we have to break
sometimes we have to bend
until the good times come again
chorus:
i'll see you then
when the good times come again
when you and i have made it back
from the people and the places we have been
i'll see you then
when the good times come again
the door that we go out of
is door that we come in
when the good times come again
when the good times come again
hope we both survive the world out there
you'll never know what wind will blow
so don't forget i care
and don't forget the way we felt together
sometimes we have to hold
to all the good that's been

"in april weather
when the meadow was bloomin'
we walk together
to the top of the hill
upon the clover
when the meadow was bloomin'
we dreamed together
just us true lovers will
but summer flies on
far across the horizon
and winter lies on
over the valley and hills
do you remember
when the meadow was bloomin'
in bleak december
do you think of me still
but summer flies on
far across the horizon
and winter lies on
over the valley and hills
do you remember
when the meadow was bloomin'
in bleak december
do you think of me still
do you remember
just as i always will"
"you were sweet sixteen, you were sweet sixteen
i love you as i never loved before!
since first i met you on the village green
come to me, or my dream of love is o'er!
i love you as i loved you
when you were sweet
when you were sweet sixteen
when first i saw the lovelight in your eye
and dreamt the world held naught but joy for me
and even though we drifted far apart
i never dreamt of what i dream of thee
i love you as i never loved before!
since first i met you on the village green
come to me, or my dream of love is o'er!
i love you as i loved you
when you were sweet
when you were sweet sixteen"
"outside the sky is water color grey
newspaper says to look for rain today
no one around for company
and so i turn to memories to pass the time away
each face that flashes back to mind
seems as it was untouched by time
i can't recall quite all the names
each one is precious all the same
how strange to think
how many friends
were lost somewhere behind
where are they now
how i miss those companions
who walked the canyons of the night
by my side
where are they now
like so many crazy dancers
we live only for the answers in a song
but that was long ago
where are they now
when love was new and wonderful
there was no word impossible
the future we saw with our inds
was something of our hearts design
between today and yesterday
life came between us all"
"where do i begin to tell the story
of how great a love can be
the sweet love story that is older than the sea
the simple truth about the love she brings to me
where do i start
with her first hello
she gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
they'll never be another love another time
she came into my life and made the living fine
she fills my heart
she fills my heart with very special things
angel songs and wild imaginings
she fill my soul with so much love
that any where i go i'm never lonely
with her around who could be lonely
i reach for her hand
she's always there
how long does it last
can love be measured by the hours in a day
i have no answers now
but this much i can say
i know i'll need her until the stars all burn away
and she'll be there
how long does it last
can love be measured by the hours in a day
i have no answers now
but this much i can say
i know i'll need her until the stars all burn away
and she'll be there"
"autumn days
lying on a bed of leaves
watching clouds up through the trees
you said our love was more than time
it's colder now, the trees are bare and the nights are long
can't get warm since you've been gone
i can't stop singing sad songs
chorus:
where do i go from here
tell me where do i go from here
you say you'd take me through the years
so where do i go from here
lovers plans, like falling leaves on windy days
flutter past and they fly away
i thought i knew you all so well
and i need you now
i need to feel you in the night
i need your smile so warm and bright
i wish my mind could let you go
repeat chorus twice
you said that you'll take me though the years"
"oh what a time
what a warm an wonderous time
so sweet a shinning moment in the sun
oh what a time
was there ever such a time
then suddenly it's done
the moment passes
where, where does the time go
must we let it end
where,where does the time go
gone to soon my friend
and where, where go the echo's
of our laughter ringing the air
oh where ever the time goes
i will see you there
must we let it end
and where,where go the echo's
of our laughter ringing the air
oh where ever the time goes
i will see you there"
"where have you gone
it's been so long
winter's turned into spring
and you're still not with me
so far away sweet yesterday
love came' round but couldn't stay
where have you gone
do you still care
rainy april regrets
all this pain and sorrow
let me find some other kind
some sweet love that's right this time
friends, dear hearts all around me
but deep in my soul i'm cold as stone
once true love found me
now i'm so alone
where have you gone
where are you now
it's so hard to forget
all those magic moments
i still sing our song
still holding on to love"
"it seems we stood here
and take like this before
we look at each other
in the same old way
but i can't remember
where or when
the clothes you're wearing
are the clothes you wore
the smile you're smiling
you where smiling then
i can't remember where or when
something's that happened for the first time
seem to be happening again
and so it seems that we have met before
and laugh before and loved before
but who knows where or when
something's that happened for the first time
seem to be happening again
and so it seems that we have met before
and laugh before and loved before"
"where you go
i will go
where you walk
i'm beside you
my love, where you are is where i want to be
where you go
we will go
maybe scared
but together
with you, i'm prepared the rest is destiny
when it starts
take my hand
and whether it's through hell or to the promised land
god knows where
i'll be there
where you go
no matter where we go
take my hand
and whether it's through hell or to the promised land
where you go
i will go
where you lie
so will i
and i'll stay
i will stay
'till the day
that we die
'till the day we die"
"i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
where the tree tops glisten
and chrilden listen
to hear sleybells in the snow
i'm dreaming of a white cristmas
with every christmas card i write
may your days be marry and bright"
"you were in my dreams
always in my dreams
that was long before
i ever saw you standing there
when i felt afraid
of the choice i made
i would close my eyes
and hope my dreams would comfort me
but now i'm free
who needs to dream when there is you?
who needs a heaven to look forward to?
for my whole life through
who needs to dream?
you're my dream come true
in my fantasy
you believed in me
and as long as you were there
then i believed in me
now suddenly
who needs to dream when there is you?
who needs a heaven to look forward to?
for my whole life through
who needs to dream?
you're my dream come true
now you are my dream
you are my only dream
i'll hold you in my heart forever
who needs to dream?
who needs to dream?
when i see you there
then i see my every dream come true
who needs to dream when there is you?
who needs a heaven?
for my whole life through
who needs to dream?
you're my dream come true
every dream
all come true
my dream come true!"
"something's in the air
i answer the phone and there's nobody there
and you&acute;re changin' the way
that you're wearin' your hair
and i wonder yes i wonder
something's on my mind
the letters you get, cigarettes that i find
and you know that i'd have to be deaf,
dumb and blind
not to wonder not to wonder
who's been sleeping in my bed
gettin' what i get
when i don't get it
who's been sleeping in my bed
yeah, that's what i said
i just don't get it
who's been sleeping
who's been sleeping in my bed
little things i miss
the ring on your finger, the fire in your kiss
how the hell could the love
that we had come to this
and i wonder yes i wonder
i don't understand
the paperboy winks at the telephone man
and the milkman he smiles
when he's shakin' my hand"
"why don't we live together
only the two of us, we'll learn to trust
don't have to say forever
'cause we know the rain could start
and break our hearts
but we'll never find the future if we hesitate
we'll spend our life waiting
why don't we live together
taking it day by day we'll find a way
to build us a dream that's better
and still have our wings to fly if love should die
can't spend our life rehearsing all these lines of love
it's time to raise the curtain
why don't we live together
whether loves lives or dies
at least we know we tried
we've both been burned before
but now we know this love is sure
and there'll be no more sorrow
this love is burnin' bright it lights up tomorrow
why don't we live together
takin' life's rocky ride
side by side
sailin' thru stormy weather
searchin' for sunny skies with open eyes
sharin' the tears and the laughter is the only way
we'll find the love we're after
why don't we live together
whether love lives or dies"
"a prima donna, slipped into her leather
but she was restless
she knew it in her heart of hearts
she said ""tonight youd better pull yourself together,
because tonight im gonna pull myself apart!""
out on the streets
everyone is searchin for a thrill
but shes the only one thats out there
really dressed to kill
and she said ""listen to me, its not a tragedy,
this time im gettin thorough and now theres
something you can do for me!
and oh, oh, take me to the wild places
and let me show you what the night is for
cos i dont wanna dream
i wanna set the wheels in motion
i dont wanna see your eyes across a dancin floor""
tv angel with her eyes full of smoke
gazin at the hero, hes so mucho macho
he shrugs, he says ""this must be some kind on joke.""
as she pulls on his cigarette and loves him to distraction.
but she cries, ""i dont wanna feel like a machine
im not the only one who wants to feel the in between
thats why im deep into this state of fascination
thats why ive lost the art of conversation.
and oh, oh, take me to the wild places
if you wanna see whats really in my soul
but youd better keep your eye on where my pretty face is
cos in the heat of the moment i just lose control
in the heat of the moment, i just lose control!""
eyes out of focus, the sharpening of blades
the sad tension, reek of patchouli
even the jokers are dealin in spades
its one dimension, its all so pass
just then a voice said,
""honey, its too late to change your mind""
her face tightened
i could see shed found a new design
and she said, ""listen to me, its just a fantasy
this time im comin through
and now theres something you can do for me...
theres something you can do for me!
and oh, oh, take me to the wild places
and let me show you what the night is for
i dont wanna dream, i wanna set the wheels in motion
cos in the heat of the moment i just lose control
in the heat of the moment i just lose control."""

"fame, fame, fame, is it worth it?
fame, fame, fame, can you take it?
fame, fame, fame, are you ready?
fame, fame, fame, will you make it?
you were touched
with the gold
of a warm summer morning
a symphony born in the sun
they loved you like pagans
and followed your climb
the strongest
most beautiful one
you've flown to the clouds
where the air's very thin
and the word is out
all around town
they've lined up for miles
with their holiday grins
they love to see
a winner go down
winner go down
learning to lose
lie in the gravel
bathe in the blues
they'll run to the rooftops
screaming the news
winner go down
winner go down
and now the arena
is quiet and darkened
the crowd is covered in smiles
they're holding their breath
at the thought of the slaughter
but you sure kept 'em waiting awhile
they built up your legend
and danced in your light
'til they longed
for the day to come 'round
when they'd see you break down
and cry like a baby
they love to see a winner go down
winner go down
learning to lose
lie in the gravel
bathe in the blues
they'll run to the rooftops
screaming the news
winner go down
winner go down
fame, fame, fame, is it worth it?
fame, fame, fame, can you take it?
fame, fame
the trial is over
the crowd has gone home
yes, all their predictions came true
but even the thrill
being there for the fall
it's just glory they borrowed from you
winner go down
learning to lose
lie in the gravel
bathe in the blues
they'll run to the rooftops
screaming the news
winner go down
they love to see a winner go down
learning to lose
lie in the gravel
bathe in the blues
they'll run to the rooftops
screaming the news
winner go down
i hate to see a winner go down"
"sleigh bells ring, are you listening
in the lane, snow is glistening
a beautiful sight,we're happy tonight
walkin' in a winter wonderland
gone away is the bluebird
here to stay is a new bird
he sings a love song as we go along
walkin' in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
and pretend that he is parson brown
he'll say ""are you married?""
we'll say ""no man,
but you can do the job when you're in town.""
later on we'll conspire
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid
the plans that we made
walkin' in a winter wonderland
were walkin' in a winter wonderland
yea, walkin' in a winter wonderland"
"open a door
on the seventeenth floor
secretary sends me through
walkin' right in
with a big time grin
but i'm shakin' in my shoes
suit one shakes my hand
but it takes him a beat to recall my name
gotta move it along
gotta play somethin' strong
gotta show 'em why i came
work the room
work the room, baby
nobody here wants to know you
but tomorrow they'll be talkin' about you
work the room
startin' in sweet
with a rockin' beat
show 'em i can really ride
not about fluff
get to serious stuff
here's my softer side
suit two frowns
is it bringin' him down?
or does it mean he's in the groove?
back to the beat
activatin' their feet
see the pradas start to move
work the room
they're movin'
oh baby
watch them beginnin' to wonder
you can bet tomorrow
they'll have serious hunger
work the room
go one step up
or all the way back
take the turns
or jump the track
rise an inch   or fall for a mile
all the time remember to smile
stoppin' the show
but they don't say go
suddenly smiles all 'round
man oh man
we're shakin' hands
telling me they like my sound
big suit smilin' at me
talkin' about sales and fame
everybody's talkin' to me
makin' it like i got it
dammit now they know my name!
work the room
they want me
i got it!
you went in an unsung zero
you're comin' out a musical hero
never gonna have to work the room again!"
"i had a great time
and i wished you were there
new friends, good wine
i sure had my share
but i wouldn't be here now
if i didn't care
didn't i say we were written in stone
so how come you're sittin' alone?
and hey, did i shine
did they open that door
that's yours, that's mine
it's what we're looking for
so i shoulda called baby
trust me some more
didn't i say we were written in stone
so how come you hang back alone?
and the rain comes down
and the sea turns grey
and the waves beat hard
the stone wears away
til there's only sand
on a cold new day
where once we were written in stone
where once we were written in stone
right now is my chance
i'm boiling inside
i'm needed, i'm known
and you wanna hide
it's your party too, babe
c'mon for the ride
didn't i say we were written in stone
so how come i'm here all alone?
and the rain comes down
and the sea turns grey
and the waves beat hard
the stone wears away
til there's only sand
on a cold new day
where once we were written in stone
where once we were written in stone"
"sometimes it's hard to believe
how simple life can be
just when you think
you'll never reach the end
you're finally round the bend and see
there's no need to cry anymore
life's better than before
yesterday fades away into the past
the pain you thought would last
is gone
chorus:
and you begin again
sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
but you begin again
even though you're heart is breaking
in time, the sun will shine
and you'll begin again
you'll begin again
life's bittersweet mystery
never tells what will be
you can create your own reality
and make your dreams come true
it's really up to you
if you begin again
sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
but you begin again
even though your heart is breaking
in time, the sun will shine
and you'll begin again
you'll begin again
when you begin again"

i want to go and play hide and seek
i want to go and bounce the moon

you and i, are just like a couple of tots
running across the meadow
picking up lots of forget me nots

you make me feel there are songs to be sung
bells to be rung, and a wonderful fling to be flung

"our friends all use the past tense when they speak of you
and so to make them comfortable i use it too
they'd soon have me comitted if only they knew
what i believe wif all my heart is true
i noe you're there
although it's nothing i can prove
i noe you're there
by just the way the shadows move
and though i say goodbye and finally let you go
i know you're there
although i don't know how i know
i know you see
the crazy things i sometimes do
they make you laugh
so i still do them just for you
and while i'm entertaining all the frenz i love
i noe u see
and that you're laughing from above
you needn't panic
i'm not consulting any guru
calling psychics
or practicing with voodoo
i'm not maniac or depressive
i just miss you
so i'll go on
enjoying every lovely day
because i'm sure
you would've wanted it that way
and when there's sorrow it's not more than i can bear"
"fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you
if you're young at heart.
for it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind
if you're young at heart.
you can go to extremes with impossible schemes.
you can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams.
and life gets more exciting with each passing day.
and love is either in your heart, or on it's way.
don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
to be young at heart.
for as rich as you are, it's much better by far
to be young at heart.
and if you should survive to 105,
look at all you'll derive out of being alive!
and here is the best part, you have a head start
if you are among the very young at heart.
and if you should survive to 105,
