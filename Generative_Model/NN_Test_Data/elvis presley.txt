why can't you see
what you're doing to me
when you don't believe a word i say?
we can't go on together
with suspicious minds
and we can't build our dreams
on suspicious minds
so, if an old friend i know
drops by to say hello
would i still see suspicion in your eyes?
here we go again
asking where i've been
you can't see these tears are real
i'm crying
we can't go on together
with suspicious minds
and we can't build our dreams
on suspicious minds

or dry the tears from your eyes

quite as good as i should have.
maybe i didn't love you,
quite as often as i could have.
little things i should have said and done,
i just never took the time.
you were always on my mind.
you were always on my mind.
maybe i didn't hold you,
all those lonely, lonely times.
and i guess i never told you,
i'm so happy that you're mine.
if i made you feel second best,
girl i'm so sorry, i was blind.
you were always on my mind.
you were always on my mind.
tell me.
tell me that your sweet love hasn't died.

"and now the end is near
and so i face the final curtain
my friend, i'll say it clear
i'll state my case of which i'm certain
i've lived a life that's full
i've traveled each and every highway
and more, much more than this
i did it my way
regrets, i've had a few
but then again, too few to mention
i did what i had to do
and saw it through without exemption
i planned each charted course
each careful step along the byway
oh, and more, much more than this
i did it my way
yes, there were times, i'm sure you knew
when i bit off more than i could chew
but through it all when there was doubt
i ate it up and spit it out
i faced it all and i stood tall
and did it my way
i've loved, i've laughed and cried
i've had my fails, my share of losing
and now as tears subside
i find it all so amusing
to think i did all that
and may i say, not in a shy way
oh, no, no not me
i did it my way
for what is a man, what has he got
if not himself, then he has not
to say the words he truly feels
and not the words from one who kneels
the record shows i took the blows
and did it my way
the record shows i took the blows
and did it my way"
"when you're weary, feeling small
when tears are in your eyes i will dry them all
i'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
and friends just can't be found

oh, like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
when you're down and out, when you're on the street
when evening falls so hard, i will comfort you
i'll take your part oh! when darkness falls and pain is all around
yes, like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
oh, like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
sailing on, silver girl, sailing on by
your time has come to shine
all your dreams are on their way
see how they shine
oh, if you need a friend,
i'm sailing right behind

i will ease your mind"

be mine tonight
tomorrow will be too late,

when i first saw you
with your smile so tender
my heart was captured,
my soul surrendered
i'd spend a lifetime
waiting for the right time
now that your near
the time is here at last.
it's now or never,
come hold me tight
kiss me my darling,

i've hungered for your touch
a long lonely time
and time goes by, so slowly

i need your love
i need your love
god, spread your love to me
lonely rivers
flow to the sea, to the sea
to the open arms of the sea
lonely rivers cry
wait for me, wait for me
i'm coming home
wait for me
my love, my darling
i've hungered for your kiss
oh lonely, lonely time
i need your love

when we've been there ten thousand years
bright shining as the sun

through many dangers, toils and snares,
i have already come
it's grace that brought me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home.

if you can't find a partner
use a wooden chair.""
let's rock, everybody, let's rock.

"there must be lights burning brighter somewhere
got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
if i can dream of a better land
where all my brothers walk hand in hand
tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true
there must be peace and understanding sometime
strong winds of promise that will blow away
all the doubt and fear
if i can dream of a warmer sun
where hope keeps shining on everyone
tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear
we're lost in a cloud
with too much rain
we're trapped in a world
that's troubled with pain
but as long as a man
has the strength to dream
he can redeem his soul and fly
deep in my heart there's a trembling question
still i am sure that the answer gonna come somehow
out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle
and while i can think, while i can walk
while i can stand, while i can talk
while i can dream, please let my dream
come true, right now
let it come true right now

"when i was a child, ladies and gentlemen, i was a dreamer.
i read comic books, and i was the hero of the comic book. i saw movies, and i
was the hero in the movie.so every dream i ever dreamed has come true a hundred
times. these gentlemen over there, these are the type who care, are dedicated.
you realize if it&acute;s not possible that they might be building the kingdom,
it&acute;s not far fetched from reality. i&acute;d like to say that i learned
very early in life that:
'without a song the day would never end
without a song a man ain&acute;t got a friend
without a song the road would never bend
without a song...'
so i keep singing a song.
good night."

my drinking water's muddy so don't you tell me buddy
that i wouldn't be better off dead
it's a long lonely highway gettin' longer all the time
and if she don't come and get me
well, i'm gonna lose my mind

and sit there holdin' hands.
you're so square.
baby, i don't care.
you don't like hotrod racin'
or drivin' late at night.
you just wanna park where it's nice and dark.
you just wanna hold me tight.
you're so square.
baby, i don't care.
you don't know any dance steps that are new,
but no one else could love me like you do, do, do, do.
i don't know why my heart flips.
i only know it does.
i wonder why i love you, baby.
i guess it's just because
you're so square."
"you look like an angel
walk like an angel
talk like an angel
but i got wise
you're the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise
you fooled me with your kisses
you cheated and you schemed
heaven knows how you lied to me
you're not the way you seemed
you look like an angel
walk like an angel
talk like an angel
but i got wise
you're the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise
i thought that i was in heaven
but i was sure surprised
heaven help me, i didn't see
the devil in your eyes
you look like an angel
walk like an angel
talk like an angel
but i got wise
you're the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise
you're the devil in disguise
oh yes you are
the devil in disguise
oh yes you are"
"hey baby, i ain't askin' much of you
no no no no no no no no baby, i ain't askin' much of you
just a big a big a hunk o' love will do
don't be a stingy little mama
you're 'bout to starve me half to death
well you can spare a kiss or two and
still have plenty left, no no no
baby, i ain't askin' much of you
just a big a big a hunk o' love will do
you're just a natural born beehive
filled with honey to the top
well i ain't greedy baby
all i want is all you got, no no no
baby, i ain't askin' much of you
just a big a big a hunk o' love will do
i got wishbone in my pocket
i got a rabbit's foot 'round my wrist
i can have everything, but lucky charms could bring
if you'd give me just one sweet kiss, no no no no no no no
baby, i ain't askin' much of you
just a big a big a hunk o' love will do"
"when a boy like me meets a girl like you
then i must believe wishes come true
i just look at you and i touch your hand
and this ordinary world becomes a wonderland
there are many girls i have met before
but i pass them by because i knew
there would be this magic moment,
one to last a lifetime through
when a boy like me meets a girl like you"
"cowboy, cowboy marry me

"if i had my life to live over
i know just what i'd like to be
a pampered pet of a rich brunette
sitting on my mama's knee
someone to love me
someone to care
rubberduck dubble little fingers through my hair
i need a dog's life
what a life, that's good enough for me
that's good enough for me
if i had a bone to be picking
a picking chicken or a steak
curled up there in an easy chair
man, that won't be hard to take
i'll always be faithful
that's what i'd be
never bite a hand that feeds me, no siree
just lead a dog's life
what a life
that's good enough for me
that's good enough for me
i'd find me a pink little poodle
and lose my noodle over her
i chase her 'round all over town
just to ruffle up her fur
nuzzle her muzzle
a hole in her paw
greatest case of puppy lovin' you ever saw
it's called a dog's life
what a life
that's good enough for me
you heard me say it now
that's good enough for me"
"i can see you now living like a queen
in a house that has everything, everything but love
crystal chandeliers, chauffeured limousines
yes you'll really have everything, everything but love
i see diamonds, sables, sapphires and pearls
and as the picture clears
poor little rich girl sitting all alone
counting her treasures in tears
better just a shack where two people care
than a house that has everything, everything but love
i see diamonds, sables, sapphires and pearls
and as the picture clears
poor little rich girl sitting all alone
counting her treasures in tears
better just a shack where two people care
than a house that has everything, everything but love
than a house that has everything, everything but love"
"well a hundred years from now i won't be crying
a hundred years from now i won't be blue
my heart will have to forget that we ever met
but i won't care a hundred years from now
i'll never forget sweetheart the night you told me
that you could live without my love somehow
that's all in the past i knew it wouldn't last
but i won't care a hundred years from now"
"now that the truth is hard to face
i can't forget you once were mine
someone else is in my place
whenever we meet my heart beats out of time
just a little bit of green
clouds my eyes to what i've seen
just a little bit of green
when i see you with someone new
and knowing that there's nothing i can do
please don't try to tie me down
those are the words you often say
i can't help seeing you around
you smile with surprise, i turn my eyes away
just a little bit of green
oh oh ho, clouds my eyes to what i've seen
just a little bit of green
when i see you with someone new
and knowing that there's nothing i can do
oh oh oh oh oh oh
just a little bit of green
oh oh ho, clouds my eyes to what i've seen

"i just got your letter baby
too bad you can't come home
i swear iâ€™m goin' crazy
sittin' here all alone
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues
i ain't slept a wink since sunday
i can't eat a thing all day
every day is just blue monday
since you've been away
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues
whoops there goes a teardrop
rollin' down my face
if you cry when you're in love
it sure ain't no disgrace
i gotta get myself together
before i lose my mind
i'm gonna catch the next train goin'
and leave my blues behind
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues
whoops there goes a teardrop
rollin' down my face
if you cry when you're in love
it sure ain't no disgrace
i gotta get myself together

"six foot six stood on the ground, weighted 235 pounds
but i saw that giant of a man brought down to his
knees by love
he was the kind of man who would gamble on love
look you in the eye and never back up
but i saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love
can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
like the rules that govern our land
strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this
thing called love
it can lift you up, it can put you down
take your world and turn it all around
ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger
than love
men like me they worry and doubt
trouble their minds day in and day out
too busy a livin' to worry about a thing called love
and then i see a mother's tenderness
as she holds her young close to her breast"
"did you ever notice when the sun goes down
out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound
it's a whistling tune for walking in the night
if you listen you can hear it in the breeze
specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees
it's a whistling tune for walking in the night
and the murmuring waters sing the song
the echoing mountains hum along
the whispering valleys fill the air
with a whistling tune our hearts can share
it's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon
listening to old mother nature's favorite tune"
"you kiss me darling, a miracle starts
a magic feeling, comes into our hearts
the spell of love began, when we're alone
and we're in, a world of our own
you say you want me, and music i hear
touch me my darling, and clouds disappear
the sky is bright above, and cares have flown
and we're in, a world of our own
holding you close, is heaven
only i know, what it's worth
knowing you're mine, forever
is the greatest wonder on earth
nothing can change it, the magic's begun
when we're together, our hearts become one
i find a happiness, i've never known
when we're in, a world of our own"
"now adam and evil, they go hand in hand
eve taught him sin, that's the way it all began
but every time you kiss me, my heart pounds like a drum
so trouble is a woman, trouble here i come
i'm lonely like adam, you're evil like eve
i shouldn't take forbidden fruit 'cause i believe
i'll be heading straight for heartache
i should cut loose and run
but if loving you means heartache
heartache, here i come
you're not the angel that i dreamed about
but you're the devil i don't want to live without
a woman's a woman, a man is a man
i can't be free i'm just putty in your hands
who cares about tomorrow, i need your love tonight
and even if you're evil, baby hold me tight
you're not the angel that i dreamed about
but you're the devil i don't want to live without
a woman's a woman, a man is a man
i can't be free i'm just putty in your hands
who cares about tomorrow, i need your love tonight
and baby if you're evil, baby hold me tight
hold me tight
hold me tight"
"but now after loving you
what else is there to do
for honey, all the rest is just gonna have to be second best
i know i'll go through life comparing her to you
that's 'cause i'm no good
i'm no good to anyone after loving you
your precious love cannot be erased
by just another woman with a pretty face
and your memory
you know it will remain for it cannot be erased
other loves may come along
they can't live up to you
that's 'cause i'm no good
i'm no good to anyone after loving you
your precious love cannot be erased

"hello misfortune, how's my old friend ""mr. misery""?
i've been away so long i bet you think you saw the last of me
got no bed, to rest my head
no doors or walls or window pane
now all i needed was the rain
rain, rain, rain, rain
met a little honey at the ""buzzin' bumble bee cafe""
yes i did
one drink and all my money and that honey bee had flown away
i'm 'bout as low, as i can go
i don't really mean to complain
now all i needed was the rain
rain, rain...rain..rain
all i needed was this rain..."
"a well i bless my soul
what's wrong with me?
i'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
my friends say i'm actin' wild as a bug
i'm in love
i'm all shook up
mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
i can't seem to stand on my own two feet
who do you thank when you have such luck?
i'm in love
i'm all shook up
mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
please don't ask me what's on my mind
i'm a little mixed up, but i'm feelin' fine
when i'm near that girl that i love best
my heart beats so it scares me to death!
she touched my hand what a chill i got
her lips are like a vulcano that's hot
i'm proud to say she's my buttercup
i'm in love
i'm all shook up
mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
my tongue get tied when i try to speak
my insides shake like a leaf on a tree
there's only one cure for this body of mine
that's to have the girl that i love so fine!"
"all that i am or ever hope to be
lies in your hands
you are my destiny
when you are in my arms, i rule the world
and when we're far apart, how cruel the world
all that i want is to be near to you
to spend my life making it clear to you
you are my heart, my soul, my dream come true
all that i am, i am because of you
all that i want is to be near to you
to spend my life making it clear to you
you are my heart, my soul, my dream come true
all that i am, i am because of you
because of you"
"we almost shared a dream
we almost made it as a team
how nice it would have been.
we almost touched the stars
and there stood heaven, almost ours
we were just outsiders looking in.
we had the chance to fall
but fate stepped in to end it all
before it could begin.
and if it's true, you're really going
there's nothing but goodbye to say
the saddest part of all is knowing"
"i was always, baby, i was always
well almost always true to you
met a pretty mademoiselle
her papa owned a small hotel
oh, i was almost always true to you
i resisted tho' my arm was twisted
i was almost always true to you
stayed away from drinkin' wine
thought about you all the time
oh, i was almost always true to you
kept refusin' don't jump to conclusions
i was almost always true to you
i would never grab like this
i would never steal a kiss"
"your lips were made for kisses so tender
i'm almost in love tonight
when we are close, my heart says surrender
i'm almost in love tonight
and here under the spell of evening
i long to hold you tight
heaven is near, why think of tomorrow
i'm almost in love tonight
it may be just the spell of evening
i long to hold you tight
heaven is near, why think of tomorrow
i'm almost in love tonight
almost in love"

walking barefoot by the stream

on my face as in a dream

baking down upon our sides
my lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses
your hands gentle in reply
and the time will be our time
and the grass won't pay no mind
child, touch my soul with your cries
and the music will know what we've found
i, hear a hundred good byes
but today i hear only one sound
the moment we're living is now
now now now now now now now
young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing
cools the sweat inside my palms
close my eyes, hear the flowers growing
as you lay sleeping in my arms
and the time will be our time
and the grass won't pay no mind
no the grass won't pay no mind"

you're the star i reached for
you're a dream so rare
you're my greatest treasure
nothing can compare

anyone not only mine alone

it makes no difference, baby doll

it makes me feel so very nice
anyplace is paradise
when i'm with you
whether we're standing on your doorstep
or sitting in a park
or strolling down a shady lane
or dancing in the dark
where i can take you in my arms
and look into your pretty eyes
anyplace is paradise
when i'm with you
give me a cave up in the mountains
or a shack down by the sea
and i will be in heaven, honey
if you are there with me
where i can kiss your pretty lips
see the love light in your eyes
anyplace is paradise
when i'm with you
baby, i'd live deep in the jungle
and sleep up in a tree
and let the rest of the world go by
if you were there with me
where i could love you all the time
babe, a jungle would be fine
anyplace is paradise"
"i memorize the note you sent
go all the places that we went
i seem to search the whole day through
for anything that's part of you
i kept a ribbon from your hair
a breath of perfume lingers there
it helps to cheer me when i'm blue
anything that's part of you
oh, how it hurts to miss you so
when i know you don't love me anymore
to go on needing you
knowing you don't need me
no reason left for me to live
what can i take, what can i give
when i'd give all of someone new
for anything that's part of you"
"i'll be a strong as a mountain,
or weak as a willow tree,
anyway you want me,
that's how i will be.
i'll be a tame as a baby,
or wild as the raging sea,
anyway you want me,
that's how i will be.
in your hand my heart is clay,
to take a mold as you may.
i'm what you make me, you've only to take me,
and in your arms i will stay.
i'll be a fool or a wise man,
my darling you hold the key,
yes, anyway you want me,
that's how i will be,
i will be."
"are you lonesome tonight?
do you miss me tonight?
are you sorry we drifted apart?
does your memory stray
to a brighter summer day,
when i kissed you and called you ""sweet heart""?
do the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare,
do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
is your heart filled with pain?
shall i come back again?
tell me dear, ""are you lonesome tonight""?
i wonder if you're lonesome tonight?
you know, someone said
""the world's a stage, and each must play a part"".
fate had me playing in love
with you as my sweetheart,
act one was when we met;
i loved you at first glance.
you read your lines so cleverly,
and never missed a cue then came act two.
you seemed to change; you acted strange, and why?
i'll never know.
honey, you lied when you said
""you loved me"" and i had no cause to doubt you.
but i'd rather go on hearing your lies
that to go on living without you.
now the stage is bare,
and i'm standing there with emptiness all around
and if you won't come back to me,
then they can ring the curtain down.
is your heart filled with pain? shall i come back again?
tell me dear, ""are you lonesome tonight""?"
"are you sincere when you say i love you
are you sincere when you say you love me too
oh and are you really mine every day, all the time
i've gotta know which way to go
will our love grow, are you sincere
are you sincere when you say i love you
honey, are you sincere when you say you love me too
and are you really mine every day, all the time
i've gotta know which way to go
will our love grow, are you sincere"
"let the stars fade and fall
and i won't care at all
as long as i have you
every kiss brings a thrill
and i know that it will
as long as i have you

you've turned your back on yesterday
betrayed a man who swore he'd make you pay

you ride to meet the woman you stole from him
oh no!...charro don't go!...

your past is catching up and closing in
you've been halfway to hell and back again
and now you laugh in the devil's face
with your last breath...
you'll run a race with life and death...

with a dollar in my hand

i'm a long ways from home
and i missed my loved one so
in the early mornin' rain
with no place to go
out on runway number nine
big 707 set to go
well i'm out here on the grass
where the pavement never grows
where the liquor tasted good
and the women all were fast
there she goes my friend
she's rolling out at last
hear the mighty engines roar
see the silver wing on high
she's away and westward bound
for above the clouds she flies
where the mornin' rain don't fall
and the sun always shines
she'll be flying over my home
in about three hours time
this ol' airports got me down
it's no earthly good to me
'cause i'm stuck here on the ground
cold and drunk as i might be
can't jump a jet plane
like you can a freight train
so i best be on my way
in the early mornin' rain
so i best be on my way
in the early mornin' rain
so i best be on my way"

dark shadows follow me
here's where life's dream lies disillusioned
the edge of reality

laughing with mockery
the border line of doom i'm facing
the edge of reality
on the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
the girl with the nameless face
on the edge of reality where she overpowers me
with fears that i can't explain
she drove me to the point of madness
the brink of misery
if she's not real then i'm condemned to
the edge of reality
on the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me

on the edge of reality where she overpowers me

who went to meet el toro
though he fought as he had never done before
he could not beat, el toro
the bull el toro, brought him defeat and pain
and to his sorrow, the matador knew shame
they said time would never heal the many scars
brought by the great, el toro
and the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
caused him to hate, el toro
the bull el toro, brought him defeat and pain
and to his sorrow, the matador knew shame
so one night, when no one was on sight
the matador, went to finish the score
in the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight
he fought the bull...and they fought once more
when they found the matador and saw him dying
he'd never see tomorrow
now they say that on the spot where he was lying
still walks the proud el toro
the bull el toro, brought him defeat and pain"

fools give their hearts much too soon
just put in two bars of stardust
just hang out one silly moon
oh! they've got their love torches burning
when they should be playing it cool
i used to laugh but now i'm the same
take a look at a brand new fool
fools fall in love just like schoolgirls
blinded by rose colored dreams
they build their castles on wishes
with only rainbows for beams
oh! they're making plans for the future
when they should be right back in school
i used to laugh but now i'm the same
take a look at a brand new fool
all right!
they've got their love torches burning

"before you go walk out on me
take a look around tell me what you see
here i stand like an open book
is there something here you might have overlooked
'cause it would be a shame if you should leave
and find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be
the years we had were not all bad
in fact i know the good outweighed the bad
now you say that you've grown tired
you want to be by yourself a while
it would be a shame if you should go
and find that freedom was a long time ago
i know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
they just keep on drivin' us apart
you could go where i could never find you
but could you go far enough to get away from your
heart
so one more time, for ol' times sake
come and lay your head upon my chest
please don't throw this moment away
we can forget the bad and take the best
if you don't have nothing left to say
let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake
if you don't have nothing left to say"
"don't look so sad, i know it's over
but life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
there's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
lay your head upon my pillow
hold your warm and tender body close to mine
hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window
and make believe you love me one more time
for the good times
i'll get along, you'll find another
and i'll be here if you should find you ever need me
don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
there'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
lay your head upon my pillow
hold your warm and tender body close to mine
hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window
and make believe you love me one more time

that keeps you in the back roads
by the rivers of my memory
it keeps you ever gentle on my mind
it's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
planted on their columns mellowed by me
or something that somebody said
because they thought we'd fit together walking
it's just knowing that the world will not be cursin'
or forgiving when i walk along some railroad track and find
that you're moving on the back roads
by the rivers of my memory and for hours
you're just gentle on my mind
though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
and the junk yards and the highways come between us
and some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and i was gone
i still might run in silence
till' the join might stain my face
and the summer sun might burn me 'till i'm blind
but not to where i cannot see you
walking in the back roads
by the rivers flowing gently on my mind
i dip my cup of soup from a gurgling,
cracking cauldron in some train yard
i'm barely runnin' cold how
have a dirty hat pulled low across my face
who cupped hands around the tin cans
i pretend to hold you to my breast and find
that you're wavin' from the back roads

"the old home town looks the same,
as i step down from the train,
and there to meet me is my mama and papa
down the road i look and there runs mary
hair of gold and lips like cherries
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home
yes, they'll all be there to meet me,
all creatures smiling sweetly
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home
the old house is still standing,
though the paint is cracked and dry
and there's an old oak tree that i used to play on
down the lane i'll walk with my sweet mary
hair of gold and lips like cherries
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home
then i awake and look around me
cold gray walls surround me
and i realize that i was only dreamin'
there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
again i'll touch the green, green grass of home
yes, they'll all be there to meet me
in the shadow of that old oak tree"
"well, i quit my job down at the car wash,
left my mama a goodbye note,
by sundown i'd left kingston,
with my guitar under my coat,
i hitchhiked all the way down to memphis,
got a room at the ymca,
for the next three weeks i went huntin' them nights,
just lookin' for a place to play,
well, i thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,
but nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.
well, i nearly 'bout starved to death down in memphis,
i run outta money and luck,
so i bought me a ride down to macon, georgia,
on a overloaded poultry truck,
i thumbed on down to panama city,
started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,
hopin' i could make myself a dollar,
makin' music on my guitar,
i got the same old story at them all night piers,
there ain't no room around here for a guitar man
we don't need a guitar man, son
so i slept in the hobo jungles,
roamed a thousand miles of track,
till i found myself in mobile alabama,
at a club they call big jack's,
a little four piece band was jammin',
so i took my guitar and i sat in,
i showed 'em what a band would sound like,
with a swingin' little guitar man.
show 'em, son
if you ever take a trip down to the ocean,
find yourself down around mobile,
make it on out to a club called jack's,
if you got a little time to kill,
just follow that crowd of people,
you'll wind up out on his dance floor,
diggin' the finest little five piece group,
up and down the gulf of mexico,
guess who's leadin' that five piece band,
well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man."

"somewhere in, in the distant night
i hear christmas bells
the gentle snow keeps falling down on people
who are homeward bound
that's the it's always been
the circle really never ends
christmas seems to come and go
from the place that i don't know
holly leaves and christmas trees
it's that time of year
lights aglow and mistletoe
don't mean a thing when you're not here
as i walk, walk this lonely street
the sound of snow beneath my feet
i'll think of how it used to be
holly leaves and christmas trees
use to mean so much to me"
"home is where the heart is
and my heart is anywhere you are
anywhere you are is home

but everything that i hold dear
is close enough to touch
for home is where the heart is
and my heart is anywhere you are
anywhere you are is home
maybe i'm a rolling stone
who won't amount to much
but everything that i hold dear
is close enough to touch
for home is where the heart is

and build a castle on the beach

consider all the *worlds thy hands have made
i see the stars, i hear the rolling thunder
thy power throughout the universe displayed
refrain:
then sings my soul my savior god to thee
how great thou art

then sings my soul my savior god to thee
how great thou art how great thou art

and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
when i look down from lofty mountain grandeur
and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze 
and when i think that god, his son not sparing
sent him to die, i scarce can take it in
that on the cross my burden gladly bearing
he bled and died to take away my sin 
when christ shall come with shout of acclamation
to take me home what joy shall fill my heart
then i shall bow in humble adoration"

"i look at you and wham, i'm head over heels
i guess that love is a banana peel
i feel so bad and yet i'm feeling so well
i slipped, i stumbled, i fell
one crazy kiss and bam, i head for the skies
i guess that love is like a cake of ice
you skate along but then you can never tell
i slipped, i stumbled, i fell
i never thought i'd get tricked
by you sweet talking lies
you've got a bag of tricks
and when you get busy
i got dazzled and dizzy
i fell like a ton of bricks
my knees are weak, my head is spinning around
i guess that love has turned me upside down
thought i'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out well"

no one seems to worry

every day siesta, every night fiesta
i think i'm gonna like it here
all this lovely scenery
there's more to it than greenery
i know a chance for romance is always near
mission bells are ringing, everybody's singing
i think i'm gonna like it hear
the sound of laughter from every doorway
sweet music floating across the square
it seems to say things are going better
your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air
down to my last peso, but i'm not afraid to say so
i feel just like a brave, spanish cavalier
i don't care where we go, so lead on"" mi amigo""

they can't see you
and my arms,
they can't hold so tight

that are yearning,
but they're no good to me
cause i know i can't kiss you tonight

but now i changed my mind,
because she broke the ties that bind,
and i know that she never cared for me.
well, i thought i knew just what she'd do,
i guess i'm not so smart.
oh, you tried to tell me along she'd only break my heart.
i'm left, you're right, she's gone.
you're right, and i'm left all alone.
well, she's gone i know not where,
but now i just don't care.
for now i'm falling for you.
if you'll forgive me now,
i'll make it up somehow.
so happy we will be,
in a home just for three,
and i'll soon forget her,
now i know.
well, i thought i knew just what she'd do,
i guess i'm not so smart.
you tried to tell me all along,
she'd only break my heart.
well, you're right, i'm left, she's gone.
you're right, and i'm left all alone.
well, she's gone, i know not where,
but now i just don't care,"
"show me a girl with a dimple on her cheek
butter melts in her mouth
when she opens it to speak
show me a girl who is acting so refined
and i'll show you a girl with one thing on her mind
so i say ""you know what?"" she says ""what?""
i say ""what? oh i'm not the marrying kind
for you've got what it takes
and it takes what you've got
but i'm not the marrying kind
don't kiss me, don't claw me
don't pet me, don't paw me
and i won't leave my freedom behind""

"hear that lonesome winter bird
he sounds too blue to fly
the midnight train is whining low
i'm so lonesome i could cry
did you ever see a robin weep
when leaves began to die
that means he's lost the will to live
i'm so lonesome i could cry
the silence of a falling star
lights up a purple sky
and as i wonder where you are
i'm so lonesome i could cry"
"i'm with a crowd but oh so alone
i still have the picture you sent me
and you signed it with love you recall
and the one of me that you wanted
is now hanging face to the wall
at night i'm never alone

and i'm afraid that you will be gone"

my heart and all it can give
for just as long as i live i'm yours
no arms but yours dear will do
my lips will always be true
my eyes can only see you, i'm yours

your joy and tears i'll gladly share
and when things go wrong dear
just hold out your hand and i'll be there
with every beat of my heart
with every breath that i take
now and forever, sweetheart, i'm yours
and as the years roll along
your joy and tears i'll gladly share

that i think you ought to know
that my eyes are on you baby
since a long time ago
and now i fin'ly got the nerve
and i'm gonna make my move

cause it's gonna be hard to do
ain't no two ways about it baby
your love was meant for me

can't get you off my mind
i know that i can't live without you
i think about you all the time
i've got a thing about you baby
ain't nothing i can do
i've got a thing about you baby
a thing about lovin' you
ain't it just like a woman
when she knows she's got a man
she'll wring you out and turn you 'bout
in the palm of her hand
and then she starts to thinkin'
then maybe she's put you in a blind
she'll give you just a little lovin'
it'll drive you out of your mind
i've got a thing about you baby
ain't nothing you can do
i've got a thing about you baby"

i've gotta find my baby
i gotta hold her tight and tell her i love her

all night long

since my baby's been gone
my baby's gone
i've gotta find my baby
i've gotta find my baby"
"lying by your side i watch you sleeping
and in your face the sweetness of a child
murmuring the dreams you won't recapture
though it will haunt the corners of you mind
i've lost though you're near me
and your body's still this kind
i've lost you on a journey,
but i can't remember where or when
who can tell when summer turns to autumn
and who can point the moment love grows cold
softly without pain the joy is over
though why it's gone will neither of us know
oh, i've lost you yes, i've lost you
i can't reach you anymore
we ought to talk it over now
but reason can't stand in for feeling, oh
six o'clock the baby will be crying
and you will stumble, sleeping to the door
in the chill and solemn gray of morning
we play the parts that we have learned to well
oh i've lost you, oh, i've lost you
oh, you won't admit it so
i've lost you on a journey,
but i can't remember where or when no more
oh, i've lost you yes, i've lost you
i can't reach you anymore
we ought to talk it over now
but reason can't stand in for feeling, oh

and there were three gates in the west
three gates in the north
three gates in the south
and that makes twelve gates to the city all square wide
john, you saw might numbers way up in the middle of the air
well john declared that he saw a man
he held twelve bright stars in his right hand
well his eyes flashed fire like the burning sun
old john got scared and he wanted to run
well he wanted to run but his feet wouldn't go
cause he felt the gospel cutting like a two edged sword
and he heard a voice that said john, you take a look
and read what you see and then you write it in a book
and he saw twelve angels in the east
and there were twelve angels in the west
twelve angels in the north,
twelve angels in the south
that's a total of forty eight angels to the city, four squared wide"

saying christmas is near
they ring out to tell the world

singing sweetly somewhere
and a glow fills my heart

as the sound of their singing fills the air
oh why can't every day be like christmas
why can't that feeling go on endlessly

telling santa what to bring
and the smile upon his tiny face
is worth more to me than anything"

and perhaps never meet anymore
till we gather in heaven's bright city
far away on that beautiful shore

by the side of the river of life
where the charming roses bloom forever
and where separations come no more

walking every night here in the shadows
so afraid that sometime he may follow
there's always the chance he'll find us

to fight the unbeatable foe
to bear with unbearable sorrow
to run where the brave dare not go
to right the unrightable wrong
to love pure and chaste from afar
to try when your arms are too weary
to reach the unreachable star
this is my quest to follow that star
no matter how hopeless, no matter how far
to fight for the right
without question or pause
to be willing to march
into hell for a heavenly cause
and i know if i'll only be true
to this glorious quest
that my heart will lie peaceful and calm
when i'm laid to my rest
and the world will be better for this
that one man, scorned and covered with scars
still strove with his last ounce of courage
to reach the unreachable star
the fight the unbeatable foe
to dream the impossible dream
and the world will be better for this
that one man, scorned and covered with scars
still strove with his last ounce of courage
to reach the unreachable star
to fight the unbeatable foe
to dream the impossible dream"

but i know that soon there'll come a bright tomorrow
when the world will all be free from sin and strife

while the dew is still on the roses
and the voice i hear falling on my ear
the song of god discloses
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known
he speaks and the sound of his voice
is so sweet the birds hush their singing
and the melody that he gave to me
within my heart is ringing
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me i am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there"
"as the snow flies
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
a poor little baby child is born
in the ghetto
and his mama cries
cause if there's one thing that she don't need
it's another hungry mouth to feed
in the ghetto
people, don't you understand
the child needs a helping hand
or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
take a look at you and me,
are we too blind to see,
do we simply turn our heads
and look the other way
well the world turns
and a hungry little boy with a runny nose
plays in the street as the cold wind blows
in the ghetto
and his hunger burns
so he starts to roam the streets at night
and he learns how to steal
and he learns how to fight
in the ghetto
then one night in desperation
a young man breaks away
he buys a gun, steals a car,
tries to run, but he don't get far
and his mama cries
as a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
face down on the street with a gun in his hand
in the ghetto
as her young man dies,
on a cold and gray chicago mornin',
another little baby child is born
in the ghetto
as his mama cries"

but it wouldn't be the same without you
those familiair old places would just make me blue
'cause it wouldn't be the same without you

i could start my life over with somebody new
but it wouldn't be the same without you

a matter of time before i go home
i have been way from her now for a long time
and i've lived a life i thought that it should be
it's a long, long way from now to maybe sometime
and the waiting round is really killing me
it's a matter of time before i go back there
a matter of time oh lord, before i go home
it's a long way i know and the goin' ain't easy
she'll see me again it's a matter of time
i think i'll take a train right early in the morning
just to see how far i get along the way
but the trains don't run too often only sometimes
so i guess i'd better wait another day
it's a matter of time before i go back there
a matter of time before i go home
it's a long way i know and the goin' ain't easy
she'll see me again, it's just a matter of time"
"it's a sin, my darling
how i love you
because i know
our love could never be
it's a sin
to keep this memory of you
when silence proves
that you've forgotten me
the dreams i built for us
has tumbled
each promise broken
like my heart
it's a sin, my darling
how i love you
so much in love
and yet so far apart
i'm sure you're happy with another
who shares the love i cannot win
why pretend that i can live without you"

i threw them all away
and now you tell me, you dare to tell me
i should go back to them
what do you think i should say
i found it hard to leave them
saddest thing i ever had to do
my problems haven't started
and it's easy for you
i had a wife and i had children
i threw them all away
and now you tell me, you dare to tell me
i should go back to them
what do you think, what on earth do you think i should say
if you ever tire of the good life
call me in a year or two
i've got no choice, i'll forgive you

oh, how impossible
can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
it's just impossible
if i had you could i ever ask for more?
it's just impossible
and tomorrow, should you ask me for the world
somehow i'd get it, i would sell my very soul
and not regret it for to live without your love
is just impossible
can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
it's just impossible

"maybe it's too late.
sometimes i even hate myself for loving you
trying to be strong
then nighttime comes along and i start loving you
wanting you.
where is all my selfcontrol i'm burning way down in my soul
and needing you,
and wishing i could be the man, i try to
hating me for wanting you to be with you
knowing you don't love me like you used to
but it's midnight, ohh and i miss you
it's getting late and i know that's when i am weak
funny how things have a way of looking so much
brighter in the day light
i ought to go to bed to try
and straighten out my head and just forget you
oh but it's midnight yes and i miss you
it's getting late and i know that's when i am weak

morning must come
knowing, knowing there's no one for me

"i see the the sunlight in her hair
i feel the warm smile that she wears
she has no recipe for love
but i just can't get enough
from the distance of my mind
clock that's ringing says it's time
wake up to my destiny
it's time to face reality
it's only love that i feel inside
but i'll get by somehow
it's only love, there must be something else for me girl
i tell myself that it's not real
there's nothing left for me to feel
i'll just be going on my way
tomorrow brings another day
only love that i feel inside
but i've got to be strong
my mind's made up, it's only love
but i know i'll get by, take my heart and my pride
and just throw it aside
it's only love
it's only love, it's only love, it's only love

and i could make it stay
this hour of love we share
would always be
there'd be no coming day
to shine a morning light
and make us realize our night is over
when you walk away from me
there is no place to put my hand
except to shade my eyes against the sun
that rises over the land
i watch you walk away
somehow i have to let you go
cause it's over
if you knew just how i really feel
you might return and yet
there are so many times
that people have to love and then forget
oh there might have been a way somehow
i have to force myself to say
it's over
so i turn my back,
turn my collar to the wind
move along in silence
trying not to think at all
i set my feet before me
walk the silent street before me
now it's over
if time were not a moving thing
and i could make you stay
this hour of love we share
would always be
there'd be no coming day
to shine a morning light
and make us realize our night is over"

way back up in the woods among the evergreens
there stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
where lived a country boy named johnny b. goode
who never ever learned to read or write so well
but he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell.
go go
go johnny go go johnny b. goode
he used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track
oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade,
strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made,
people passin' by they would stop and say
""oh my but that little country boy can play""
his momma told him ""some day you will be a man,
and you will be the leader of a big ol' band
many people comin' from miles around,
to hear you play your music till the sun go down,
maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin
'johnny b. goode' tonight"""

to let you go, never knowing
what went wrong
kentucky rain keeps pouring down
and up ahead's another town

to some old gray bearded man
sitting on a bench
outside a gen'ral store

was it yesterday,
no, wait the day before

with a preacher man who asked
""where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?""

jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
you know he's gone, gone, gone
hip shaking king creole

it's as good as done
he holds his guitar
like a tommy gun
he starts to growl
from way down his throat
he bends a string
and ""that's all she wrote""
well, he sings a song about a crawdad hole
he sings a song about a jelly roll
he sings a song about pork and greens
he wails some blues about new orleans
well, he plays something evil
then he plays something sweet
no matter how he plays
you got to get up on your feet
when he gets the rockin' fever

who to love and not to love
you may never find contentment for your heart
you could go unloved forever and darling that means never

"somewhere out in empty space,
long before the human race,
something stirred,
a vast and timeless source began,
intelligence was born and then,
there was the world,
powers filled the universe,
matter formed and broke the curse,
of nothingness,
love became an ageless soul,
nature reached her highest goal,
and breathed the breath of life,
everlasting life.
well creatures come from out of sight,
daylight came from in the night,
and all was good,
life became a masterplan,
love produced the perfect man,
that understood,
the image of the makers word,
worshiped him with all he had,
but then one day,
from in the depths an evil seed,
grew and manufactured greed,
that changed the way of life,
everlasting life,
oh the loving power looked and saw,
inside the heart of man a flaw,
began to grow,
well, the fires of hell began to burn,
and so he sent his chosen son,
to let us know,
that love had surely made us all,
and hate would surely make us fall,
so from the cross,
well he showed the world that dreadful day,
that love could be the only way,
or all is lost of life,
everlasting life,
for life is love,
and love is life."
"you gave me love to enjoy
like a bright shiny toy to a baby
no matter what you would do
i depended on you like a baby
one thing i know i love you
yes i loved you like a baby
it was a fool that you took
and i think 'cause you look like a baby
to lover's ways i was blind
'cause i just had a mind like a baby
you're just a flirt
and i had to be her guide like a baby
i need you so, i need you so
the day i found i am alive
then i broke down and cried like a baby
well it was then i could see
you were playing with me like a baby
well you can bet that some day"
"tonight iâ€™m alone without you my dear
it seems that there's a longing for you still
oh but i just keep it there so i won't be alone
in our little cabin on the hill

and left me here all alone
to listen to the rain beat on our window pane"
"little darlin', little darlin'

"i went and bought myself a ticket and i sat down in the very first row
they pulled the curtain but then when they turned the spotlight way down low
little egypt came out a struttin' wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow
singing, ying ying, ying ying, ying ying, ying ying
she had a ruby on her tummy and a diamond big as texas on her toe
she let her hair down and she did the hoochie coochie real slow
when she did her special number on the zebra skin i thought she'd stop the show
singing, ying ying, ying ying, ying ying, ying ying
she did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
she winked at the audience and then she turned around
she had a picture of a cowboy tatooed on her spine
said, phoenix, arizona 1949
yeh, let me tell you people little egypt doesn't dance there anymore
she's too busy mopping and a takin' care of shopping at the store
'cos we've got seven kids and all day long they crawl around the floor"

over promises that i made
but for the first time in my life
i know now how it feels to be afraid
i don't know what iâ€™d do if you go away

for a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love coming down
love coming down
i remember all the times you told me
love's all that matters to you
and looking back now, wondering how i believed
i had things more important to do
i can see how i must have looked to you
like some fool on a merry go round
and that a man's so busy going up in the world
that he couldn't see love going down
love going down
can't you see how everything iâ€™ve learned
would just be wasted if you leave me
if you just give one more try
i swear iâ€™ll always be here when you need me

i used to let these feelings pass me by

so i confess my loneliness

that i have lost it through my fingers like a golden breath of air
if i cared i wouldn't be singing this love song of the year
i know the time cannot erase the days
love is past and i've gone away
from now on i'll make it very clear
cos' i don't want to write
another love song of the year
it's a lonely song and not too clear
but to me it's very dear
i guess this song can only be
my feelings went out in the sea of love
to me this has got to be the love song of the year
i know the time cannot erase the days
love is past and i've gone away
from now on i'll make it very clear
cos' i don't want to write
another love song of the year
i used to laugh i used to cry
i used to laugh, these feelings passed me by

i always want to be near..."
"oh, mama liked the roses she grew them in the yard
but winter always came around and made the growing way too hard
oh, mama liked the roses and when she had the time
she'd decorate the living room, for all us kids to see
when i hear the sunday bells ringing in the morning
i remember crying when she used to sing
oh, mama liked the roses but most of all she cared
about the way we learned to live
and if we said our prayers
you know i kept the family bible
with a rose that she saved inside
it was pressed between the pages
like it had found a place to hide
oh, mama liked the roses in such a special way
we bring them every mother's day
and put them on her grave
oh, mama liked the roses mmmm"
"i'm satisfied with just a cottage below
a little silver and a little gold
but in that city where the ransomed will shine
i want a gold one that's silver lined
i've got a mansion just over the hilltop
in that bright land where we'll never grow old
and some day yonder we will never more wander
but walk on streets that are purest gold
don't think me poor or deserted or lonely
i'm not discouraged i'm heaven bound
i'm but a pilgrim in search of the city
i want a mansion, a harp and a crown
i've got a mansion just over the hilltop
in that bright land where we'll never grow old
and some day yonder we will never more wander"

who makes my temperature rise?
who makes me tremble with wonderful rapture
with one burning glance, from her eyes
marguerita
once i was free as a gypsy
a creature too wild to tame
then suddenly i saw, marguerita
and i was caught, like a moth in the flame
marguerita is her name
marguerita
her lips have made me her prisoner
a slave to her every command
she captivates me, and intoxicates me
with one little touch of her hand
marguerita
sweet marguerita sweet,sweet marguerita"
"nothing's quite as pretty as mary in the morning
when through the sleepy haze i see her lying there
soft as the rain that falls on summerflowers
warm as the sunlight shining on her head
when i awake and see her there so close beside me
i want to take her in my arms,
the ache is there so deep inside me
nothing's quite as pretty as mary in the morning
chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
and when she turns to touch me i kiss her face so softly
and then my mary wake to love and love again
and mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
she doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share,
we share together
nothing's quite as pretty as mary in the evening
kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair
and as we walk, i hold her close beside me
all our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share"

so i can hold mary tight
i'll bring my guitar to the moonlight tonight
i love you mary lou brown
imagine your heart floating right up the sigh i love you mary lou brown
down by the green river side with my arms open wide
i'll wait for her, only for her
mary lou brown's mine tonight"

she's bumper to bumber rollin' side by side.
maybellene, why can't you be true?
oh maybellene, why can't you be true?

the rain water blowin all under my hood

and that's when i heard that highway sound.
the cadillac a sittin' like a ton of lead
a hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.
the cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
and i caught mabellene at the top of the hill.

oh maybellene, why can't you be true?
you've started back doing the things you used to do."

to wandering off to ponder things i never talk about
a pretty girl i used to know but wouldn't know if we met face to face
and defying every logic known
i wish all the time machine could take me back again
to the wonder of my first love, the old folks tease me 'bout
referring to her only as my little friend
somewhere far away and maybe not so far away
the child has grown into a woman of the world
i assume just knowing that she knew so much of life at such a tender age
i learned from her the whispered things the big boys at the pool hall talk about
the thrill and disappointment, fear and shame that first love brings
but oh, how i thought i loved my little friend
the fragrance of the green grass mingled with the scent of love and warming earth
the moonlight night i kissed and cried and swore i'd never touch another girl
but time moved fast and i moved on and i loved others time and time again
but with each time i thought of her and always gave a little more
assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
oh oh oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
oh oh oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend"

for if you play with love
it can bring tears my dear
my wish came true
to my surprise
when you stood there before my eyes
and when my heart
started beating fast
t'was then i knew"

yet in my dreams i'd be nearer my god to thee
nearer my god to thee nearer to thee)

sun moon and stars forgot upwards i fly
still all my song shall be nearer my god to thee
nearer my god to thee nearer to thee"

you'll be free but where will i be
now that i’m used to love, how can i stand alone
now that love has come and gone, like the ending of a song
a song my lonely heart keeps singing

the emblem of suffering and shame;
and i love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain.
refrain
so i’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last i lay down;
i will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.
o that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
has a wondrous attraction for me;
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary.
refrain
in that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
a wondrous beauty i see,
for ’twas on that old cross jesus suffered and died,
to pardon and sanctify me.
refrain
to the old rugged cross i will ever be true;
its shame and reproach gladly bear;
then he’ll call me some day to my home far away,
where his glory forever i’ll share.

"when i was a lad and old shep was a pup
o'er hills and meadows we'd strayed
just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun
we grew up together that way
i remember the time at the old swimming hole
when i would have drowned beyond doubt
shep was right there to the rescue he came
he jumped in and helped pull me out
so the years sped along and at last he grew old
his eye sight was fast growing dim
then one day the doctor looked at me and said
i can't do no more for him jim
with a hand that was trembling i picked up my gun
i aimed it at shep's faithful head
i just couldn't do it i wanted to run
and i wished they'd shoot me instead
i went to his side and i sat on the ground
he laid his head on my knees
i stroke the best pal that a man ever found
i cried so i scaresly could see
old shepy he knew he was going to go
for he reached out and nipped at my hand
he looked up at me just as much as to say
we're parting but you'll understand
now old shep is gone where the good doggies go
and no more with old shep will i roam
but if dogs have a heaven there's one thing i know
old shep has a wonderful home"

and pick her a mess of polk salad
and carry it home in a tote sack

holding on to daddy's thumb just as tightly as he can hold
and it's hearin' people say he looks a lot like his daddy.
these things are a poor man's gold.
it's the twinkle in the eyes of the gray haired old man we call grandpa.
tellin' tales to the kids that get taller every time there told.
and it's knowin' that for a while he's no longer lonely.
these things are a poor man's gold.
it's the smell of honeysuckle in the springtime it's the silence of a freshly
fallin snow.
it's the sound of children laughing in the sunshine.
it's a crisp autum night with a million stars all aglow.
and it's the sweet sleepy sound of your warm gentle breathing.
as you cling to me in the night to keep away the cold.
and it's the softness of your body there in the darkness.
these things are a poor man's gold."

music that they played lord with a feel'
some call it folk, some call it soul
people let me tell you it was rock and roll
i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul
every day when i got home i turned on my radio
listening to the music that my idols made
i knew every single record the dj's played
a honky tonk a hound dog, a johnny b. goode
chain gang, love is strange, knock on wood
i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul
i was born to love the beat i was made for rock and roll
some thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
but the younger generation knew it would last
time's gone by, the beat goes on
but every time i hear it lord it takes me home
i was raised on rock, got that rhythm in my soul
every day when i got home i turned on my radio
mother played recordings of beethoven's fifth
mozart's sonatas down the classical liszt
my papa loved to listen to his country songs
while i was in the back room rockin' on
i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul
i was born to love the beat i was made for rock and roll
i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul
i was born to love the beat i was made for rock and roll
i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul"

who would command the hand he's playing
and solitaire is the only game in town
and every road that takes him, takes him down
while life goes on around him everywhere
he's playing solitaire
and keeping to himself, begins to deal
and still the king of hearts is well concealed
another losing games comes to an end
and deals them out again
and solitaire is the only game in town
and every road that takes him, takes him down
while life goes on around him everywhere"
"who made the mountains, who made the trees
who made the rivers flow to the sea
and who sends the rain when the earth is dry
somebody bigger than you and i
who made the flowers to bloom in the spring
who made the song for the robins to sing
and who hung the moon and the stars in the sky
somebody bigger than you and i
he lights the way when the road is long
he keeps you company
and with his love to guide you
he walks beside you
just like he walks with me
when weâ€™re filled with despair
who gives me courage to go from there
and who gives me faith that will never die
somebody bigger than you and i"

something new, these tears i cry,
something borrowed were those lips my lips knew
and thatâ€™s why iâ€™m something blue.
something old, the vows we made,
something new, the price i paid,
something borrowed, love was tried but not true.
now my life is something blue.
i guess that i had better smile
walking behind you down the aisle,
i feel iâ€™m walking to my doom,
iâ€™m really not the best man in this room.
something old, the dreams we planned,
something new, his wedding band,
something borrowed was the heart i gave you,
you returned it torn in two.

i suppose i ought to say congratulations
for you won the only girl i ever loved
but i hurt too much to face the situation
just take good care of her, take good care of her
just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
she was everything my future held in store
so remember when you take my only treasure
just take good care of her, take good care of her
i must accept it, she loves you more than me
so with my broken heart i'll bow out gracefully
please don't send me any wedding invitation
for i couldn't bear to see her there with you
if she's happy, that will be my consolation
just take good care of her, take good care of her
take good care of her, take good care of her"

the time the people used to treat the neighbor like a fellow man
and all their singin' and big prayer meetin's
when a man was proud to walk up and shake his neighbors hand
oh you talk about the good times,
talk about the good times
oh if you ever needed help a friend was there
some good neighbor
help lift your burden
mmm, and the simple joys of life a friend would share
times are harder and the people are changin'
now most folks couldn't tell you who their neighbors are
all their guns are loaded, the front doors are bolted
ain't this ol' world takin' hate and fear just a little too far
oh you talk about the good times,
talk about the good times
i wish i could go back to the days i'm speakin of
when a friend would meet you
and a smile would greet you
what this ol' world needs now is a little old fashioned love
my granddaddy god rest his soul now
well we had a big long talk together the day he died
said son this world is full of hate and venom
an' i can't wait to leave this ol' place and rest on the other side
oh you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
talk about the good times
i'm gonna see all the friends i knew in the good ol' days
we'll have a big hand shakin'
an' sit and talk together
sit down by the river jordan and sing our blues away

in my prayers, i'll mention you
when you're gone i feel so blue

now that you are close to me
i look at you with tender feeling

this tender feeling i have now

you'd be the girl i could never forget
no other love could be appealing
i loved you right from the start
and with each kiss i'll keep revealing"

king of the bullfighter ringer
he'd wipe up the floor with each brave matador
and have matador stew for his dinner

but he met his master that day
the bullfighter was a lady
and it was true love at first sight
her red cape was waving but pedro was shaking he wanted to date her that night
olã©
pedro the bull he was smitten
first time the love bug had bitten
he once was a mad bull, a wild and a bad bull
but now he was mild as a kitten
the people were starting to hiss
but pedro just wanted to kiss
the bullfighter was a lady
and pedro he liked what he saw
he floated on air with a rose in his hair
as he waltzed with that sweet matador
his fate was a bad one, his tale is a sad one
it's hanging right over her door"

"to dream the impossible dream
to fight the unbeatable foe
to bear with unbearable sorrow
to run where the brave dare not go
to right the unrightable wrong
to love pure and chaste from afar
to try when your arms are too weary
to reach the unreachable star
this is my quest, to follow that star
no matter how hopeless,
no matter how far
to fight for the right
without question or pause
to be willing to march into hell
for a heavenly cause
and i know if i'll only be true
to this glorious quest
that my heart will lie peaceful and calm
when i'm laid to my rest
and the world would be better for this
that one man scorned and covered with scars
still strove with his last ounce of courage
to reach the unreachable star"

she loves me, she loves me not

in spite of the way she turns up her nose

i'd like to take him for a spin
back to the zoo to visit his kin
he's got about as much appeal as a soggy cigarette
the lady loathes him but he doesn't know it yet
the lady's got a crush on me
the gentleman's crazy obviously
the lady's dying to be kissed
the gentleman needs a psychiatrist
i'd rather kiss a rattlesnake
or play russian roulette
the lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
she's falling fast she's on the skids
both of his heads are flipping their lids
tonight she'll hold me in her arms
i'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs

i'm not his juliet
the lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet
she wants me
like poison ivy
needs me
like a hole in the head
everyone can see she's got it bad
he's mad!
the gentleman is an egotist
i'm simply aware i'm hard to resist
he's one man i could learn to hate
how's about having dinner at eight
i'd rather dine with frankenstein
in a moonlight tete a tete

oh yes she loves me
dig that shrinking violet
oh she really loves me

she lo  lo  loves me

for you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
more dearly than the spoken word can tell
for you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
more dearly than the spoken word can tell
i've heard there's a wicked war a blazing
and the taste of war i know so very well
even now i see the foreign flag a raising
their guns on fire as we sail into hell
i have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
but how bitter will be this last farewell
for you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
more dearly than the spoken word can tell
for you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
more dearly than the spoken word can tell
though death and darkness gather all about me
my ship be torn apart upon the seas
i shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
and the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
and should i return home safe again to england
i shall watch the english mist roll through the dale
for you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
more dearly than the spoken word can tell

whenever storm clouds gather
we call on him to light our darkest day
why must it be that only when we're lonely
and hopes are dim, we call on him
why don't we call on him before we lose our way
to count our blessings and thank him while we may
we call on him when no one else will answer
we ask of him a reason to go on
when our cup of joy becomes a cup of sorrow
filled to the brim, we call on him
why don't we call on him before we lose our way"
"i just thought i heard a small voice crying
looked again and saw that it was me

that he fears the night 'cause he can't see

don't be scared to search 'cause you may find
fate holds out a candle for your footsteps
time rolls back the shadows of your mind
it's a long, long lonely night
you can make the morning if you try
it's a long, long lonely night
oh, we can make the morning if we try
girl, we can make the morning you and i
together, together, together
loneliness is darkness' first companion
spend the night alone and faith may bend
share it all and see how fear starts fading
chase away the shadows with a friend
dawn's elusive light is just beginning
now the day can push away the night
dreams can make the sun feel much brighter
hope creates a foothold for the light

who am i that he would pray not my will, thine lord?

why he ever loved me so
that to an old rugged cross he'd go

stocks and bonds, they only bore me
interest holds no interest for me
who wants to sit in the lap of luxury
who needs money, not me

i start counting dollar bills and then i fall asleep
making money never thrills me
it's making love that really kills me
what can i lose with my philosophy
who needs money, not me
what do you want
i want a big yacht, i can cruise in
the kind that girls just can't refuse in
all it takes is a million or two
who needs money, i do
any time some gal starts flirtin'
now that i'm broke i know for certain
she really digs my personality
tell me, who needs money not me

but you can do the job when you're in town
later on we'll conspire
as we dream by the fire

is the wisest of men"

she tries hard to hide
so little expected

although heaven knows how i tried
her reason for living
for aid or giving

without any warning
in the out of the morning
she cries
hurt deeping inside
the try so to hide
is beginning to show in her eyes
