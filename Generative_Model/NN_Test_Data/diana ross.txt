you've taught me all that i need
time like a river flows
twisting and turning all the way
life is an endless road
you've been with me day by day
the only way i can thank you
is to be the best that i can be
if we hold on together
just you and me
a mother's love is forever
a mother's love is for free
it doesn't matter if you're good or bad
she's there for whatever you need
in the world of fantasy
hold on to your dreams
open up your heart and see
all the love you need is me
time like a river flows
twisting and turning all the way
life is an endless road
you've been with me day by day
you are you and i am me
you've made me all that i am
heart to heart and hand to hand
always there to understand
a mother's love is forever
a mother's love is for free
it doesn't matter if you're good or bad
she's there for whatever you need
doesn't matter if you're good or bad
there's nothing like a mother's love"
"who would have ever thought
the day could ever come
when we would see
a love like this fall into pieces
and it hurts me to know that now 'til then
i'll only have these memories
and now there's no time left to pretend
and it feels like it's the end
but you're always in my heart
until we meet again
now i have to let you go
there's no way we can be friends
but you're always part of me
until we meet again
why while our love was strong
we still couldn't make it
did time have to take our live in different directions
and it hurts cause there's no way for me to reach you
we're so far apart
when did we grow so far apart
and now there's no time left to pretend
and it feels like it's the end
but you're always in my heart
until we meet again
now i have to let you go
there's no way we can be friends
but you're always part of me
until we meet again
deep in my heart i know
i'll see you again well i don't know
where or when.. but till then
and now there's no time left to pretend
and it feels like it's the end
but you're always in my heart
until we meet again
now i have to let you go
there's no way we can be friends
but you're always part of me
until we meet again
and now there's no time left to pretend

that you ain't buying
it's your move
i've made up my mind
time is running out
make a move
oh, we can go on
do you understand
it's all in your hands
it's your move
you're giving me the business
with what old come on
but you don't come across
you get me so excited
don't you know you're such a tease
when i think you're getting hot
you're not
so what's the problem
what's wrong
this kiss and miss
you know it can't go on

"i thought i'd already touched the sky
i got to know you and i don't know why
but all of my life couldn't mean as much
as just being touched by you
i never thought of me growing up
got my directions but the road was rough
it's only the dream of a teenage queen
but somehow i made it through
and i'd love to see
those faces of those friends i left behind
and even those who spoke for me
just trying to be kind
and no one said i love you just the way
i know you do
and i love being in love with you
living inside your heart
the giving and the taking
you are not forsaken
i love being in love with you
thank you just for choosing me
that we should be
being in love forever
and ever, ever
i stare and wonder at what i found
i just discovered why the world is round
round in a circle my arms will be
and doing the same as you
it ain't right it's only for you and me
only the lonely do it seperately
keep it alive on the food of love
but only the chosen few
in my life you see some changes in me
we listen and we grow
any child that clings to childish things
is trying to let go
and up to now
i'd thought i'd seen as far as i could see
and i love being in love with you
living inside your heart
the giving and the taking
you are not forsaken
i love being in love with you
thank you just for choosing me
that we should be
being in love forever
and ever, ever
and i love being in love with you
living inside your heart
the giving and the taking
you are not forsaken
i love being in love with you
thank you just for choosing me
that we should be
i love being in love with you
living inside your heart
the giving and the taking
you are not forsaken
i love being in love with you"

maybe then i could do
a simple thing like cry

i ought to get out from under
sometimes i wonder
sometimes i don't wonder at all
and as for loving again
somewhere somebody might need me
but where would it lead me?
i'd just be rising to fall
love was easy to believe in
when you wanted me yesterday
but i couldn't feel the touch of time upon tomorrow
after you
what am i gonna be?
you took a part of me
as you were passing through
after you
how am i gonna find
the me i left behind
that i'll meet after you
drifting again
from place to place without reason
season to season
i just keep running away
and as for people again
i'm just a girl who discovers
now and then lovers
who never ask me to stay
love was easy to believe in
when i walked in the light of you
now i'm walking by myself
and all i see is darkness
after you
what am i gonna be?
you took a part of me
as you were passing through
after you
how am i gonna find

i never wanted anyone more
and something in your eyes tells me
you feel the way that i do if you would like to stay here all night you know that i would say it’s all right
though i’m saying, “yes”
i confess i’ve got more on my mind‘
cause i want more of you than your time
all of you, your body and soul
every kind of love you can express
all the secret dreams you’ve never told
i want everything and i’ll take nothin’ less
all of you as long as you live
everything you’ve never shared before
i want all of you that you can give
all your joys and all your sorrows
your todays and your tomorrows
how i long to feel the warmth of your touch and then if i’m not askin’ too much
i’d like to spend my life wandering through
all the wonders of you 
and when we’re lying close in the dark
so close i feel each beat of your heart
i want you to reveal what you feel
all of you, your body and soul
everything you want this love to be
i want all of you, all that you can give
and in return for all you’re givin’
let me give you all of me

without you
thought i could walk away
and never look back
thought i had the secret
to stop these eyes from crying
told myself he were no good
so what's the need in trying
but as you see, here i am
loving you stronger than ever
promising to be better
getting into my head
i don't know how
to be nothing but yours
i guess i should have learned
from all the befores
i wrote a nice long letter
explaining my reasons for leaving
hoping it would tear you apart
and leave you grieving
i bet you didn't even read it
you're so familiar with the lines
you just glanced up at the clock
'cause you knew the exact time i'd knock
without pride
here i stand
waiting for your forgiveness
this is where i belong
come what may
this time i'll stay
you might as well lock all the doors
i guess i should have learned
from all the befores
promising to be better
and getting into my head
i don't know how to be nothing but yours
i guess i should have learned
from all the befores"

each moment with you
is just like a dream to me
that somehow came true
and i know tomorrow
will still be the same

that won't ever change and
every day love me your own special way
melt all my heart away with a smile
take time to tell me you really care
and we'll share tomorrow together
i'll always love you forever
forever
there'll always be sunshine
when i look at you
it's something i can't explain
just the things that you do
and if you get lonely
call me and take
a second to give to me
that magic you make and
every day love me your own special way
melt all my heart away with a smile
take time to tell me you really care
and we'll share tomorrow together
i'll always love you forever"
"amazing grace
how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
i once was lost
but now i'm found
was blind
but now i see
the earth shall soon
dissolve like snow
the sun forget to shine

will be forever mine
through him many dangers, toils and snares
i have already come

just for a second chance
and if you see him
tell him just how i look
the circles underneath my eyes
the make up don't seem to hide
and i stay awake every night
and i pray that he just might walk in
and love me
walk in and love me
i miss him more than he'll ever know
tell him he was
my everything
he was more than just a flame
and i need him
i miss him
and if you see him

no, it's just won't burn

i would sail a boat across the sea
i would fly a plane to wherever you may be

that my love can only grow
but if it's the last thing that i'll ever do
i swear that i'll make it back to you
before you leave

"i live on a battlefield
surrounding by the ruins of a love we built
and them destroyed between us
the smoke has cleared
as i stumble through the rubble
i'm dazed, seeing double
and i'm truly mystified
my new home is a shell hole filled
with tears and muddy water
and bits of broken heart
all around, there is desolation
scenes of devestation
of a love been torn apart
i live on a battlefield
though one where not one
single drop of blood has spilled
is no less horryfying
sweet memories
of a bygone situation
lie shattered, torn and battered
and scattered all around
my new home is a shell hole filled
with tears and muddy water
and bits of broken heart
all around, there is desolation
scenes of devestation
of a love been torn apart
everything that can, has gone wrong
it's gonna take spine to carry on
like a drownin' woman coming up for air
i'm looking for another survivor
i can't see one anywhere
my new home is a shell hole filled
with tears and muddy water
and bits of broken heart
all around, there is desolation
scenes of devestation
of a love been torn apart
i live on a battlefield, hey
i live on a battlefield, hey
can't go on, baby
tears and muddy water
scattered all around me, babe
i live on a battlefield
i live on a battlefield"

where there is mostly quiet
flowers and butterflies
a rainbow lives beside it

a summer storm
you can feel the coolness in the air
but you're still warm

will start the sky to cryin'
but not even light'ning
will be frightening my lion
and with no fear inside
no need to run
no need to hide
you're standing strong and tall
you're the bravest of them all
if on courage you must call
then just keep on tryin'
and tryin', and tryin'
you're a lion
in your own way, be a lion
come on be a lion

it took my breath away

angelically

more than i can say
how i wanted you

and hold you
'cause there's no love
like a mother's love
it's so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful love
as i watch you learn and play
i will do anything
to keep the boogieman away

"one day, as i was walking through my garden,
i saw a little frog lying on the ground.
and i thought he was sick.
so i picked him up and he wasn't sick at all. he was very sad, and he was crying.
and i said: what's a matter with you, little frog?
and he looked up at me with a lump in his throat, and he said: wribbit!
it ain't easy being green
having to spend each day the color of the leaves
when i think, i think it would be nicer being red
or yellow or gold
you see, it ain't easy being green
it seems to blend in with so many other ordinary things
and then, sometimes, sometimes people pass over you
because you're not standing out like sparkles on the water
or like the stars in the sky
but did you know that green is the color of spring
and green can be big like an ocean
and important like a mountain
and cool and friendly like
or tall and skinny like a tree
and me
but when green is all there is to be
it kind of makes you wonder why
why wonder, wonder why?
hey, i'm green and i think it'll do fine
'cause green is just what i wanna be
'cause green is beautiful, baby
right on green
and anyway, money's green
wribbit"
"if you believe
within your heart you'll know
that no one can change
the path that you must go
believe what you feel
and know you're right, because
the time will come around
when you say it's yours
believe there's a reason to be
believe you can make time stand still
you know from the moment you try
if you believe
i know you will
believe in yourself, right from the start
you'll have brains
you'll have a heart
you'll have courage
to last your whole life through

"where has my love gone?
how can i go on?
it seems, dear
love has gone away
where is my spirit?
i'm nowhere near it
oh yes, my love has gone astray
but i'll blame it on the sun
the sun that didn't shine
i'll blame it on the wind and the trees
i'll blame it on the time
that never was enough
i'll blame it on the tide and the sea
but my heart blames it on me
who poured the love out?
what made this bitter doubt?
is peace not here for me to see?
wish i could tell you what i am feeling
but words won't come for me to speak
oh, i'll blame it on the sun
that didn't fill the sky
i'll blame it on the birds and the trees
i'll blame it on the day
that ended much too soon
i'll blame it on the nights
that could not be
but my heart blames it on me"

you say you're steady, 'n you're committed

this divided affection just won't do...
i hate to give you an ultimatum
but when i'm in love, i want it all the way...oh
oh, that's the bottom line
if you really wanna keep my love
can't be givin' up what's mine...oh, that's the bottom line
i can't settle for a part time thing
need your lovin' all the time...
no imitations, give me the real thing
sugar coated promises are not enough for me,
'cause if you're fakin', don't be mistaken
i'll be out the door, before the count of three...
i hate to sound uncomprimising
but i'm never gonna play nobody's fool...

"you took a mystery and made me want it
you got a pedestal and put me on it
you made me love you out of feeling nothing
something that you do
and i was there and not dancing with anyone
you took a little, then you took me over
you set your mark on stealing my heart away
crying, trying, anything for you
i'm in the middle of a chain reaction
you give me all the after midnight action
i wanna get you where i can let you make all that love to me
i'm on a journey for the inspiration
to anywhere and there ain't no salvation
i need you to get me nearer to you
so you can set me free
we talk about love, love, love
we talk about love
we talk about love, love, love
we talk about love
you make me tremble when your hand moves lower
you taste a little then you swallow slower
nature has a way of yielding treasure
pleasure made for you, oh
you gotta plan, your future is on the run
shine a light for the whole world over
you never find your love if you hide away
crying, dying, all you gotta do is
get in the middle of a chain reaction
you get a medal when you're lost in action
i wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
instant radiation
you let me hold you for the first explosion
we get a picture of our love in motion
my arms will cover, my lips will smother you
with no more left to say
we talk about love, love, love
we talk about love
you let me hold you for the first explosion
my arms will cover you
all you gotta do is get in the middle of a chain reaction
you get a medal when you're lost in action
don't pass me by
i wanna get your love all ready for the chain reaction ..."

is the one i don't want to hear
you can deny all you want to

why not come right out and say it
you've been trying to let me down slow
so let's talk before the tears drop
you've had a change of heart
well i guess that's up to you
i couldn't change my heart
even if i wanted to
you've had a change of heart
your kiss sends a message
and i detect the signs
i got enough understanding
of a lover to realize
that you can't make him love you
though i give you my best
you're keeping your heart at a distance
and it breaks me up to confess
change of heart
well i guess that's up to you
i couldn't change my heart
even if i wanted to
change of heart
baby, everyone to talk to
you've had a change of heart
is this just a notion
a phase that will pass
a mixed up emotion
or is this change gonna last?
baby let's talk
before the tears drop
you've had a change of heart
well i guess that's up to you
i couldn't change my heart
even if i wanted to
change of heart

you've had a change of heart

never something in between
waitin' on the love of my life
to come into my dreams
everything in shades of gray
never any blues or greens
i needed someone else to turn to
someone who could help me learn to see
all the beauty that was waiting for me
you... you put the blue back in the sky
you put the rainbow in my eyes
the silver lining in my prayers
and now there's colour everywhere
you put the red back in the rose
just when i needed it the most
you came along to show you care
and now there's colour everywhere
my life was so predictable
never any mystery
but ever since you shined the light
all of that is history
now i have a hand to hold
and a reason to believe
there's someone in my life worth living for
i was hanging 'round just wishin' on a star
to put the happiness back in my heart and
you... you put the blue back in the sky
you put the rainbow in my eyes
the silver lining in my prayers
and now there's colour everywhere
you put the red back in the rose
just when i needed it the most
you came along to show you care
and now there's colour everywhere
i left those hazy days behind me
never to return again
now they're just a faded memory
'cause baby it's all so clear to see
the beauty that was waiting for me
you...you put the blue back in the sky
you put the rainbow in my eyes
the silver lining in my prayers

""pippin"" is the story of emperor charlemaine's son who could never ever find hapiness. he tried everything. he tried war, he tried religion. and he even tried a little sex. but it didn't work. too bad for him! the song i'd like to do for you know is from ""pippin"". and it's about his search for fulfillment to find his corner of the sky.
rivers belong where they can ramble
eagles belong where they can fly
i've got to be where my spirit can run free
gotta find my corner of the sky
everything has a season
everything has its time
show me a reason
and i'll show you a rhyme
cat's been on the window sill
children fit in snow
why do i feel i don't fit in
any place i go
rivers belong where they can ramble
eagles belong where they can fly
i've got to be where my spirit can run free
gotta find my corner of the sky
every man has his day dream
every man has hit goal
people like the way dreams
have of sticking to the soul
thunder clouds have their lightning
nightingales have their soul
can't you see i want my life
to be something more than long
rivers belong where they can ramble
eagles belong where they can fly
i've got to be where my spirit can run free
gotta find my corner of the sky
so many men are destined
to settle for something small
don't you know that i won't rest
until you know i had it all
so don't ask where i'm going
just listen when i'm gone
and far away you'll hear me singing
softly to the dawn
rivers belong where they can ramble
eagles belong where they can fly
i've got to be where my spirit can run free
gotta find my corner
gotta find my corner
gotta find my corner of the sky
sky"
"like the morning sun
i'll turn your dark nights into day
when your day is done
i'll be the pillow where your head will lay
like the heartbeat deep inside
on my love you can rely
count on me
count on me
count on me
count on me
like your favourite chair
i'll hold you close whether you lose or win
i'm that breath of air
flowing out and flowing right back in
i hope you know that i am here
always close and always near
count on me
count on me
count on me
count on me
i'll abide in low and higher tide
i'm always by your side
just close your eyes and i'll be right there by your side
count on me
count on me
count on me
count on me"
"this thing called love i just can't handle it
this thing called love i must get round to it
i ain't ready
crazy little thing called love
this thing  called love
it cries
in a cradle all night
it swings
it jives
it shakes all over like a jelly fish
i kinda like it
crazy little thing called love
there goes my baby
she knows how to rock'n'roll
she drives my crazy
she gives me hot and cold fever
then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
i gotta be cool relax get hip!
get on my track's
take a back seat
hitch hike
and take a long ride on my motor bike
until i'm ready
crazy little thing called love
i gotta be cool relax get hip!
get on my track's
take a back seat
hitch hike
and take a long ride on my motor bike
until i'm ready"
"i must be crazy they don't know what we've done
you are my lover
even though i know it's wrong
i hear them talking
but whatever they do
i need to love you
and if i love you couldn't we make it
got someone loving me
he won't say goodbye
he's been so good to me
i don't wanna make him cry
i need you both to love me
it's up to you
you can help me
you're the reason i can't decide
breakin' my bones and shakin' my nerves
till i just can't see tomorrow
looking at him and looking at you
and i don't know who to follow
i'll never win in the state i'm in
it's a crime of passion, i'm bad to love you
whenever i'm with you, i lose control
it's a crime of passion for me and for you
whatever i give you
it's just too late to save my soul
i need to love you
my desperation is the power to go on
each night i prayed for love
i'm at the mercy of
and if you don't hear me now
then i'll be the only one
don't wanna be, don't wanna be the only one
i saw him yesterday
the questions he asked
i think he knows about us
did we move too fast
how can we hide it
when we know it's a lie
keep our love under the covers
the pressure is too high
why do i get myself tied up
why tangle with love you borrow
i should have been known as a one man woman
should have been one love but oh no
never be a cure for the human law
it's a crime of passion, i'm bad to love you
whenever i'm with you, i lose control
it's a crime of passion for me and for you
whatever i give you
it's just too late to save my soul
i need to love you
my desperation is the power to go on
each night i prayed for love
i'm at the mercy of
and if you don't hear me now
then i'll be the only one
don't wanna be, don't wanna be the only one"
"you're like a child within
the one who just won't give in
oh how you love to play
i wanna understand
i wanna do all i can
i wanna make you stay
where will i find you
next time i lose you
i'm just a fool for your touch
cross my heart
i wanna love you
how can i love you
if you keep running away
cross my heart
it's getting stronger
i can't wait much longer
you gotta stop running away
your kisses are bittersweet
alibies incomplete
i know what you didn't say
now haven't you had your fun
is anything left undone
why can't we meet half way
when will you find out
now that the truth's out
this is more than a careless romance
cross my heart
i wanna love you
how can i love
if you keep running away
cross my heart
it's getting stronger
i can't wait much longer
you gotta stop running away
true love is never quite enough
it's so unsure
is it what you're dreaming of
darling, it's time you let me in
maybe tonight
we can start again
cross my heart
i wanna love you
how can i love you
if you keep running away
cross my heart
it's getting stronger
i can't wait much longer
you gotta stop running away
cross my heart
it's getting stronger
i can't wait much longer
you gotta stop running away
cross my heart
it's getting stronger
i can't wait much longer
you gotta stop running away"
"how do you live with a broken heart?
everytime you come too close
i just run away
i need you so much
and that's so hard to say
there is me and there is you
and i get confused
and sooner or later
i know that i'll have to choose
you know it's true
i'm crying my heart out for you
what can i do
i'm losing myself over you
over and over again
i'm crying my heart out for you
no one in love likes to lose
how do you live with a broken heart
and i can honestly say
i wanna be on my own
that too bare existence
when i was all alone
i know you're not asking me
to just live for you
but it's always how i've loved
and all i know how to do
you know it's true
i'm crying my heart out for you
what can i do
i'm losing myself over you
over and over again
i'm crying my heart out for you
no one in love likes to lose
but how do you live with a broken heart?
once again i'm falling in love
like a fool i'm falling in love
and i don't know what i'm doing
once again it's somebody else
that i need, i'm losing myself
and i'm scared of what i'm feeling
it's true
i'm crying my heart out for you
what can i do
i'm losing myself over you
over and over again
i'm crying my heart out for you
no one in love likes to lose
once again i'm falling in love
like a fool i'm falling in love
and i don't know what i'm doing, doing
once again it's somebody else
that i need, i'm losing myself
and i'm scared of what i'm feeling
about you
i'm crying my heart out for you
what can i do
i'm losing myself over you
over and over again
i'm crying my heart out for you
what can i do
i'm losing myself over you
over and over again"
"it was then i decided to call the doctor
for my appointment to buy what?
tits and ass, shall i buy a fancy pair?
tightened up that derriere
did the nose with it, all that goes with it
tits and ass, you can knock and someone's there
shake the new maracas and you're fine
tits and ass, can change your life
would they change mine
wouldn't cost a fortune, neither
wouldn't hurt my sex life either
it's a gas, i have never seen a pair
chorus girl or movie star or wife
tits and ass, oh yeah, t and a
tits and ass can change your life"
"don't leave me, don't leave me here
on the dark side of the world
my days are darker than your nights
since i lost you babe
since i lost you babe
i'm like an ember
fading out of sight
one more tear and i know i'll disappear
bring back the sunshine
that you took away
cause i need ya
and i want ya
just don't think i'm gonna make it without your love
don't you know
such a loneliness i've never known
since i lost you babe
since i lost you babe
i'm like a woman who once knew splendour
now all her wealth and riches
they are gone
bring back the sunshine
that you took away
cause i need ya
and i want ya
and i just don't think i'm gonna make it without your love
bring back the sunshine that you took away
now my future lies in back of me
since i lost you babe
since i lost you babe
i walk this lonely road to eternity
just despair and emptiness everywhere
bring back the sunshine
that you took away
cause i need ya
and i want ya
i just don't think i'm gonna make it without your love
don't leave me, don't leave me here
on the dark side of the world

right here on the dark side of the world"
"last night i had a dream
lost in a golden paradise
trying hard to find my way
every day a new surprise
i found something wonderful
here in my private world
all alone in the darkness
the truth can make you strong
did you ever kiss the sky
did you ever dream at night
did you ever wonder why
stars fall from the sky
birds know how to fly
day breaks and i'm awake
no dark clouds hanging over me
holding on for heaven's sakes
trusting's hard to do
it's a long road, where does it end
hand in hand with you my friend
we can never give up, never give in
look how far you've come
did you ever kiss the sky
did you ever dream at night
did you ever wonder why
stars fall from the sky
birds know how to fly
my hopes, my fears, my dreams
come shining through
as long as i have you
i have you
did you ever kiss the sky
did you ever dream at night
did you ever wonder why
stars fall from the sky
birds know how to fly
did you ever kiss the sky
did you ever dream at night
did you ever wonder why
did you ever kiss the sky
did you ever dream at night
did you ever wonder why"
"did you read the morning paper
did you see the front headline
did you read the morning paper
baby let me lend you mine
there on the front page was a picture
of a crowd as they watched a parade passing by
and through the haze of last nights sleep
something familiar caught my eye
there was a couple looking so much in love, yes
they had a front line view
and as i pulled the paper closer
i realized standing next to her it was you
did you read the morning paper
did you see the front headline
did you read the morning paper
baby let me lend you mine
now i know why you've been working late each night
and no longer have desire to ever hold me tight
and your busy, busy schedule was all a lie
oh, even the dream with a bonus, oh just another alibi
did you read the morning paper
did you see the front headline
did you read the morning paper
baby let me lend you mine
did you get the news today
did you read the morning paper
isn't the picture very clear
where do we go from here
did you read the morning paper
did you see the front headlines
did you read the morning paper
baby let me lend you mine
oh, what now
did you read the morning paper
did you get the news today"
"remember when you left?
you had your own rules about playing the game
and any day, you could walk away feeling no pain
now look at yourself
you're all hung up on somebody else
and in your eyes i see all the signs of the misery
that you laid on me
baby, baby
didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
didn't you know
didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
didn't you know that you'd lose your pride?
didn't anybody tell you love had another side?
you used to be so proud
now, your head's a little lower
and you walk slower
and you don't talk so loud
you've gotten wise
you know how love can build you up one moment
and the next, cut you down to size
then you discover
all she told you was a bunch of lies
baby, baby
didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
didn't you know
didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
didn't you know that you'd lose your pride?
didn't anybody tell you love had another side?
baby, baby
didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
didn't you know
didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?"
"when you look into my eyes
tell me what you see
you're the object of my desire
my secret fantasy
i see the fire, i feel the flame
it gets me everytime you look my way
you know how it makes me feel inside
come get me with your eyes
dirty looks
you're giving them to me again
dirty looks

"hush now, don't explain
just say you'll remain
i'm glad you're back
don't explain
quiet don't explain
what is there to gain?
skip that lipstick
don't explain
you know that i love you
and what love endures
all my thoughts are of you
for i'm so completely yours
cry to hear folks chatter
and i know you cheat
right or wrong don't matter
when you're with me, sweet
hush now, don't explain
you're my joy and pain
my life's yours love
don't explain"
"you say it's better to behave
just like i never met you
why is it only i can cry
and you can say goodbye in a minute
don't you remember i was your friend
and you can just erase all those days
and those tender reflections we bear
we promised not to fall in love
but it was there and soon i was in it
already i was more than your friend
it's harder for me
no words or expressions
can make you hungry for me
i've never seen you on your knees
like i'm beggin' you
don't give up, give up on each other
back where we started
no love to hold us down
i'll never give another anymore than i gave to you
will never come around
always and always
you told me love was ever and ever
together the dream will come true
if we turn back
if you turn back to me
you won't be sorry if you stay
i'll stake my life upon it
little flame inside us can be fed
take our precious love to the limit
it's the one that you need and it's your friend
it's harder for me
no words or expressions
anything that makes you worry
i've never seen you on your knees
and i'm in a hurry
how is it you can break my heart
but you can't be sorry
push away whoever you please
but i'm begging you
don't give up, give up on each other
back where we started
no love to hold us down
i'll never give another
anymore than i gave to you
will never come around, oh
don't give up, give up on each other
we can't lose tomorrow
better treasure what we've got
i'll never give another anymore than i gave to you"
"when i wake up in the afternoon
which it pleases me to do
don't nobody bring me no bad news
'cause i wake up already negative
and i've wired up my fuse
so don't nobody bring me no bad news
if we're going to be buddies
better bone up on the rules
'cause don't nobody bring me no bad news
you can be my best of friends
as opposed to payin' dues
but don't nobody bring me no bad news
no bad news
no bad news
don't you ever bring me no bad news
'cause i'll make you an offer, child
that you cannot refuse
so don't nobody bring me no bad news
when you're talking to me
don't be cryin' the blues
'cause don't nobody bring me no bad news
you can verbalize and vocalize
but just bring me the clues
but don't nobody bring me no bad news
bring some message in your head
or in something you can't lose
but don't you ever bring me no bad news
if you're gonna bring me something
bring me, something i can use
but don't you bring me no bad news"

a freckle on the nose of life's complexion
a cinderella or a shine apple of an eye

all that the law will allow
one roll for the whole shebang
one throw that bell will go clang
though i'm alone i'm a gang
eye on the target and wham
one shot, one gun shot and bam
hey, world, here i am...

i'm doing just fine without you
how i bless the day you went away
now i have a song inside
the birds sing to me

and want the best for you
the circumstances came my way
now i've learned to do for myself
and all the things i thought
that you would do for me
like leaving me alone
to go for my own
when you're not at home
i'm glad you're gone
now i have a song inside
the birds sing to me
i finally can be
free to spread my wings in harmony

"see me loving you
a fool without a lover
how can that possibly be
maybe you can show me why
i shiver when you're closer
i remember your touch without it
let me drown in your ecstasy
it's got to be do or die
don't tell me love is just one night
i know it's not true
there should be someone there to catch you
when the rain falls
and you can turn away my heaven
and maybe i was wrong
i depended on the inner voice of
experience, or just imagination
whatever you believe in, you can lose
and one way or the other, we can find
another world we can run away to
i'm living for the
experience, is only what you make it
you live forever but you never know
that somebody loves you
and when the sky is open
fly away lovers can share
i'll be there
and you can make the earth move
you can take me with no struggle
lead me through your mystical dreams
show me what you are
and we can make the wind blow
you're the power and i'm in it
you can be the fire i start
i want your heart
and let there be a story when the stories are told
i need to hear you say you love me when the night falls
we may never go to heaven but one thing that is sure
you can not ignore
i'll make it more than
experience is not imagination
you get what you believe in if you choose
somebody loves you
i couldn't get no higher
fly away lovers can share
and we'll be there
experience is not imagination
you get what you believe in if you choose
and one way or the other
we can find another world we can run away to
and i love you
experience is only what you make it
you come together when you let yourself go
and somebody loves you
i couldn't get no higher
fly away lovers can share
and we'll be there"

that i've ever seen
he wears high draped pants
stripes are really yellow

stripes are really yellow

he's so fine and mellow
love will make you drink and gamble

one last piece of my heart
what do you need, baby

i'm a fool for your love
leave me alone, please
my heart can't take any more
you left me going crazy

if you don't want my love
then set me free

i'm telling you goodbye
bye, bye

my heart can't take anymore
leave me alone, please
let me walk out that door
leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone

"since the beginning of all life's beginnings
right at the very dawning of the sun
any and everyone had cause and reason
for in good all good is done
now down in every heart there are two forces
one is for the wrong, one's for the right
but never do you have to fear with this as armor
for good always wins the fight
what's that force behind the power that wakes you each day
what's that force behind the power that chases eavil away
what's that force behind the power that puts a smile on your face
it is love, pure love, it is love
in every book of truth it has been written
that we are measured by the things we do
if for the good of all is what you like doing
then all that good will come to you
that doesn't mean you have to be a rich man
you could be a person living on the street
but if you give but only words to lift someone higher
then a heart of gold is what you will be
what's that force behind the power that wakes you each day
what's that force behind the power that chases eavil away
what's that force behind the power that puts a smile on your face
it is love, pure love, it is love
what's that force behind the power that makes you willing to share
what's that force behind the power that for a lost soul you're there
what's that force behind the power that's not to busy to care
it is love, pure love, it is love
not trying to preach about it, but no one can do without it
what's that force behind the power that will lend a hand
what's that force behind the power when others can't yes you can
what's that force behind the power it's greater than any man
it is love, god's love, it is love
what's that force behind the power that tears walls down of hate
what's that force behind the power that is never too late
what's that force behind the power that forever will wait
it is love, god's love, it is love"
"may god bless
and keep you always
may your wishes all come true
may you always do for others
and let others do for you
may you build a ladder to the stars
and climb every road
and may you stay forever young
may you grow up to be righteous
may you grow up to be true
may you always know the truth
and see the light surrounding you
may you always be gracious
stand upright and be strong
and may you stay
stay forever young
forever young
forever young
may you stay forever young

 love's on the line...oh ooh oh ooh oh...
you and i
shouldn't lose our direction,
we can't deny
love could use more attention...
we've traveled too far to let the feeling fade
this time we can change it...'cause
dreams and passion are just a breath away..."
"you've been in love once before
but never quite like this and you fall in love more and more
with every single kiss 
so tell me why do you do the things
that you continue to do
when i'm not the one who hurt you so
i wouldn't cheat on you
it can't keep goin' on
like the feeling doesn't exist
or the one you love will be the one you miss
then you'll dream about love and how it would be
but then you'll wake up to reality to find i'm gone, i'm gone
then you'll start to think and reminisce
'coz it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss
but i'm gone, i'm gone
you go through life searching for love
and you're lucky if you find someone who cares about you so
and will never mislead you 
but if you hide the way you feel, why do you carry on?
'coz i won't stay around to wait on you to make up your mind
it can't keep going on like the feeling doesn't exist
or the one you love will be the one you miss
then you'll dream about love and how it would be
but then you'll wake up to reality to find i'm gone, i'm gone
then you'll start to think and reminisce
'coz it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss
but i'm gone, i'm gone
it can't keep going on like the feeling doesn't exist
or the one you love will be the one you miss
then you'll dream about love and how it would be
but then you'll wake up to reality to find i'm gone, i'm gone
then you'll start to think and reminisce
'coz it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss
but i'm gone, i'm gone
then you'll dream about love and how it would be
but then you'll wake up to reality to find i'm gone, i'm gone
then you'll start to think and reminisce
'coz it's my hugs and kisses you'll miss
i'm gone, i'm gone

"goodmorning heartache
you all gloomy sight
goodmorning heartache
thought we said goodbye last night
i tossed and turned
until it seemed you had gone
but here you are with the dawn
wish i'd forget you
but you're here to stay
it seems i met you
when my love went away
now every day i start by
saying to you
goodmorning heartache, what's new?
stop haunting me now
can't shake you no how
just leave me alone
i've got those monday blues
straight through sunday blues
goodmorning heartache
here we go again
goodmorning heartache
you're the one who knew me well
might as well get used to you
hangin' around
goodmorning heartache

"i've got to be free
gotta be, gotta be free
i've got to be free
gotta be, gotta be free
long goodbyes, stolen glances
can't explain all that's happened in our past
i'm tired of creating lies to be alone
i'm living wrong, we're living wrong
more and more you make me
afraid to come around
you take the pleasure out of being in love
and being down and down and down and down and down
for the one who's there for me
all i really want to be is free, yeah
i've got to be free, got to be free
gotta be, gotta be free
i've got to be free, got to be free
gotta be, gotta be free
you don't know why, haven't got a clue
in the dark about why i am leaving you
you can't expect me to go on this way
no, i cannot stay, i will not stay
more and more you make me
realize what i have home
what's taboos exciting
but sometimes it just gets old
sometimes it just gets old
for as long as i am me, boy
all i really want to be is free
i've got to be free, got to be free
gotta be, gotta be free
i've got to be free, got to be free
gotta be, gotta be free
i've got to be free, got to be free
gotta be, gotta be free
i've got to be free, got to be free

"never had nothing
no one to care
that's why i seem to have
more than my share
i've got a man crazy for me
he's funny that way
when i hurt his feelings
once in a while
his only answer is one little smile
i've got that man crazy for me
he's funny that way
i can see no other way
and no better plan
end it all and let him go
to some better gal
but i'm only human
a coward at best
i'm more than certain
he'd follow me west
though he loves to work
and slave for me everyday
he'd be so much better off
if i went away
but why should i leave him
why should i go
he'd be unhappy without me i know
i've got that man crazy for me
he's funny that way"
"sweet thing,

"we said we'd try again
but trying's not enough
acting like strangers
ain't no way of making love
it's never gonna work
it's time we stop pretending

it makes no sense to stay
livin' my life in yesterday
i'm leaving, i'm leaving
and i'm begging you
heart, don't change my mind
oh, heart be strong this time and try
to help me tell him goodbye
it'll only bring pain for us to stay
oh, heart it's hard for you i know
let me, let him go
don't let me think about
how good it was before
i know you'd try anything
to keep me from that door
it's hard to leave him
when you've loved him for so long now
how can i walk away
if you're still holding on now?
i've finally found the strength
look at me, i can finally say
it's over, it's over
so, i'm begging you
heart, don't change my mind
oh, heart be strong this time and try
to help me tell him goodbye
it'll only bring pain for us to stay
oh, heart it's hard for you i know
let me, let him go
it makes no sense to stay
sad that it has to end this way
it's over, it's over
heart, don't change my mind
oh, heart be strong this time and try
to help me tell him goodbye
it'll only bring pain for us to stay
oh, heart it's hard for you i know

"in the news today
heavy weather
oh, i can remember
the skies were so blue
that lucky old moon i promised to you
now it's gone lately
something's happening
i don't understand
oh, how come decembers
are hotter that june?
and how come the flowers
don't know when to bloom?
something's wrong, people
something's happening
happening where we live
the rising smoke against an endless sea of cars
as mother nature gets another senseless scar
in the news today
i guess we're in for heavy weather
in the world today
we're heading for some heavy weather
the rain is falling harder each day
the faces keep changing
but the problem remains
something's wrong, people
right before our eyes
we've been hypnotized
the sound of silence
broken by the sound of war
how can we heal
if we keep opening up the sore?
in the news today
i guess we're in for heavy weather
in the world today
we're heading for some heavy weather
will we ever hear the message?
read the signs?
stop all this talking now
it's time to save our lives
in the news today
i guess we're in for heavy weather
in the world today
we're heading for some heavy...
the road ahead keeps leading back again
the train we're on is coming to an end
let's open up our eyes
in the world today
we're heading for some heavy weather
in the news today
i guess we're in for heavy weather
in the news today
i guess we're in for heavy weather"

here i'll stay
all of my life we'll be together you and i
i was afraid but now my doubts and fears are gone
here i am
and here i'll always stay
wanting you, needing you

you are the one thing i'm certain of
here i am"
"why should i feel discouraged
why should the shadows come
why should my heart feel lonely
and long for heaven and home?
when jesus is my portion
my constant friend
is he
his eye is on the sparrow
i know he watches me
his eye is on the sparrow
i know he watches me
i sing because i'm happy
i sing because i'm free
his eye is on the sparrow
i know he watches me
his eye, his eye is on the sparrow
i know he watches
i know he watches
i know he watches me
i sing because i'm happy
i sing because i'm free
his eye is on the sparrow
i know, i know, i know he watches over
he watches over me"
"think of home
home
when i think of home
i think of a place where there's love overflowing
i wish i was home
i wish i was back there with the things i been knowing
wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean
maybe there's a chance for me to go back there
now that i have some direction
it would sure be nice to be back home
where there's love and affection
and just maybe i can convince time to slow up
giving me enough time in my life to grow up
time be my friend, let me start again
suddenly my world has changed it's face
but i still know where i'm going
i have had my mind spun around in space
and yet i've watched it growing
if you're list'ning god
please don't make it hard to know
if we should believe in the things that we see
tell us, should we run away
should we try and stay
or would it be better just to let things be?
living here, in this brand new world
might be a fantasy
but it taught me to love
so it's real, real to me
and i've learned
that we must look inside our hearts
to find a world full of love
like yours
like me
like home..."
"are we not more than hunger and music
are we not more than harlequins and horns
are we not more than color and drums
are we not more than anger and dance
give me courage so i can spread it over my face and mouth
give me courage, give me courage
give me courage, give me courage
i walk these city streets see the people there
look into the eyes of quiet despair
and the faces tell a story that words never can
and it falls to everyone of us to try and understand
out of kindness
one act of grace makes the world we walk a better place
hope is an open window
love an open door
to reach out for each other
is what we came here for
through an open window
we can see the way
if we hold on to each other, every day
we build walls of suspicion with bars of fears
tell ourselves we'll be safe in here
i know more brings us together
than keeps up apart
first we got to tear down these walls within our hearts
we might be strangers, we can be friends
you and i we both need to let somebody in
hope is an open window
love an open door
to reach out for each other
is what we came here for
through an open window
we can see the way
if we hold on to each other, every day
give me courage so i can spread over my face and mouth
we are secret rivers with shaking hips and crests
come awake in our thunder so that our eyes can see behind trees
give me courage so i can spread over my face and mouth
give me courage, give me courage
give me courage, give me courage
hope is an open window
love's an open door
to reach out for each other
is what we came here for
through an open window
we can see the way
if we hold on to each other, every day
hope is an open window
love an open door
gotta be there for each other
is what we sent here for
through an open window
we can find a way
to love one another
hope is an open window
love an open door"
"if you really think i'm fine
then why don't you just take the time
and call me

well, let me say

that you need me
and i need you too
hey, baby what's wrong

how about you?
i know all the words
that i wanna say

right or wrong
i will stand up like a tree
happy or sad
good or bad

i'm lost in a world
made for you and me
whenever you're near
i hear a symphony
play sweet and tenderly
every time your lips meet mine now baby

i cry not for myself
but for those who never felt the joy we felt
whenever you're near

each time you speak to me
i hear a tender rap so dy of love now
baby, baby
as you stand holding me
whispering how much you care
a thousand violins fill the air
now baby, baby
don't let this moment end

"i heard the bells on christmas day
their old familiar carols play
and wild and sweet the words repeat
of peace on earth, good will to men
i thought how, as the day had come
the belfries of all christendom
had rolled along the unbroken song
of peace on earth, good will to men
then pealed the bells more loud and deep
""god is not dead nor doth he sleep
the wrong shall fail, the right prevail
with peace on earth, good will to men""
i heard a voice within me say
""do not despair this holy day
on christmas morn new hope is born
for peace on earth, good will to men"""
"everyday for a week we would try to be a table
be a sportscar, ice cream cone
the teacher, he would say
""very good except diana, try, diana, all alone""
so i dug right down to the bottom of my soul
to see how an ice cream felt
i dug right down to the bottom of my soul
and i tried to melt
so the kids in the class said:
""ooh, i feel chocolate, hey, i feel vanilla""
he said ""ok ross, what do you feel?""
and i said nothing, i ain't feeling nothing
deep down nothing is all my teacher had
everybody felt something
but i felt nothing
except the feeling that this bull shit was absurd"

when you think the world is fast asleep
you come to me, take me where i wanna go

i can tell you how weak i've grown
you make me feel like i never loved a man before
never held him in my arms, never told him i loved him
i remember all the lovers coming through my door
but you make me feel like i never loved a man before
it's hard to say it
words don't come so easily to me
but it's here in my heart
and it's making me lose control
what else can i tell you
who'd refuse a night that takes you away
and touches your very soul
you make me feel like i never loved a man before
never held him in my arms, never told him i loved him
i remember all the lovers coming through my door
but you make me feel like i never loved a man before
i went along looking at love differently
oh but now it's so strong
look what you've done to me
you make me feel like i never loved a man before
never held him in my arms, never told him i loved him
i remember all the lovers coming through my door
but you make me feel like i never loved a man before"
"i wanna have all your love

chorus fades"
"when i had you to myself
i didn't want you around
those pretty faces always
made you stand out in a crowd
but some one took you from the bunch
when love was all it took
now it's much too late for me
to take a second look
oh baby give me one more chance
won't you please let me
back in your heart
oh darling i was blind to let you go
but now since i see you in his arms
i want you back
yes i do now
i want you back
ooh ooh baby
i want you back"
"day after day i must face a world of strangers
where i don't belong,
i'm not that strong
it's nice to know that there's someone i can turn to
who will always care
you're always there
when there's no getting over that rainbow
when my small list of dreams won't come true
i can take all the madness the world has to give
but i won't last a day without you
so many times when the city seems to be
without a friendly face,
a lonely place
it's nice to know that you'll be there if i need you
and you always smile
it's all worth while
when there's no getting over that rainbow
when my small list of dreams won't come true
i can take all the madness the world has to give
but i won't last a day without you
touch me and i end up singing
troubles seem to up and disappear
you touch me with the love you're bringin'
i can't really lose when you're near
when you're near my love
if all my friends have forgotten all their promisses
they're not unkind,
just hard to find
one look at you and i know that
i could learn to live without the rest
i found the best
when there's no getting over that rainbow
when my small list of dreams won't come true
i can take all the madness the world has to give
but i won't last a day without you
when there's no getting over that rainbow
when my small list of dreams won't come true
i can take all the madness the world has to give
but i won't last a day..."
"i wouldn't change a thing
if i had to live my life all over
i wouldn't change a thing
if i had to live my life all over
i lived a life that's full
many times i had to pull my way to the top
never knowing where i'm gonna stop
i made my mistakes
but lord, what i learned
it led me straight to you babe
and that's my only concern
i wouldn't change a thing
if i had to live my life all over
oh, i'd do it all again
if i had to live my life all over
it saddens me to think
that somewhere along the way
i'd change my course
and i wouldn't be here today
so i'll take my ups and downs
and bear it with a smile
cause it brought me straight to you babe
and it makes it all worthwhile
i wouldn't change a thing
if i had to live my life all over
i'd do it all again
if i had to live my life all over

"i've got a funny kind of guy
nobody knows him
any better than i
says without me
he can get along
but i know that's just a man's way
of saying he's strong
but i wouldn't change him no
oh i wouldn't change his funny ways
'cause he's the cause of my sunny days
and though sometimes he brings me little tears
still love the man he is
if i do something to please him
he never gives me credit
if i think he'll bring me candy and roses
huh, i might as well forget it
he's the kind of a man
who likes his privacy
and when a mood hits him
i know when to let him be
but i wouldn't change him no
i wouldn't change his funny, funny ways
'cause he's the cause of my sunny days
and though sometimes he brings me little tears
still love the man he is
sometimes when he hurts me so bad
i think i've got migraine in the head
all he has to do is touch me
tears disappear
i'll forgive him in a minute
i have to pretend
there ain't much i know
he's the kind of a man
who likes to run the show
but i wouldn't change him, no
i wouldn't change his funny ways
'cause he's the cause of my sunny days
though sometimes he brings me little tears
still love the man he is
oh i love that man
i wouldn't change his funny ways
and i wouldn't change the man he is..."
"every star has a twinkle
every palm has a wrinkle
every leaf comes from a tree
i would agree
so if everything is made up of two
and the sky really needs the blue
for my other half
i'll settle for you
every future has a past
every first has a last
every night has a day
come what may
so if everything is made up of two
whether it be old or new
for my other half
i'll settle for you
who wants to be like a sea without a shore
the love just drifting forever more
every smile has a frown
all you gotta do is turn it upside down
every house has a door
of that i'm sure
so if everything is made up of two
i think it would be best if you know
for my other half
i'll settle for you
don't you know, i'll settle for you
i'll settle for you
if i had to settle, baby

you knew that i was shy
so you teased and made me cry
but i loved you
then one day you came
you told me you were leaving
you gave your folks the blame
and made me cry again
when you said
little girl please don’t wait for me
wait patiently for love
some day it will surely come
ooh little girl please don’t wait for me
wait patiently for love
some day it will surely come
and i’m still waiting
i’m waiting
ooh still waiting
oh i’m a fool
to keep waiting
for you
ooh i’m waiting
i’m still waiting
for love
for you
then someone finally came
he told me that he loved me
i put him off with lies
he could see i had no eyes
so he left me
once again alone
like a child without her playmate
i had to face the truth
i was still in love with you
but you said
little girl please don’t wait for me
wait patiently for love
some day it will surely come
ooh little girl please don’t wait for me
wait patiently for love
some day it will surely come
and i’m still waiting
love has never shown his face
since the day he walked out that door
he filled my life an empty space

i've been living on your memory
in a world where we were one
and you told me you could make it on your own
i'm watching you tonight
and it's making me cry
when i lost you, i lost everything
but our love should never die
not mine, my love is born to be your love
oh baby
to make history near you
but the moment when i see me in your eyes
you're gone, you're gone
you can say goodbye if you want to
i love you but i'll try to understand
but in my soul i know it's meant to be
together you and me
but i know you came to fade away
like voices in the wind
and i wonder if you feel my love
it's stronger than it's ever been
i'm watching you tonight
and there's no other one
all the love we gave eternally
now it's dying in the sun
not mine, my love was born to be your love

feeling?
swear to god this is more than i can deal with

i can't stand not knowing

a hope for happy endings?
alone and scared
something i don't want to be
what did he see when he looked inside of me?
if this is just a dream
how come i feel like screaming?
this is the real world
gotta do what you must, girl
well
can i?
can i?
is this what feeling gets?
so is there a happy ending?
there's nothing here but the fear of
will i try?

not ever knowing why?
please
please
can someone tell me why?"

can always brighten up my day
and your laugh
can make my problems fade away
i love you
maybe you don't know this
and that's ok
i'll be right here
to say it over and over anyway
just in case
it's been in my heart for a while
nothing seems to make me smile

you don't know the joy you bring
nothing makes my heart sing
like you do, you do
i love you
maybe you don't know this
that's ok, ok

your eyes
do you know how beautiful you are, you are?
don't change

only twice as smart
kindness was a thread
she used to weave my world apart
there were three of us seen all over town
now there's only two
someone's missing guess who
now i see how she schemed and
worked her way in between
planted seeds of mistrust
to make us fight unaware
her comforting ways when i would cry
shadowed the look of triumph in her eye
just like a snake on the limb tree
a friend is an enemy you can see
'cause what you got that'll make you lose
and then turn around and step in your shoes
i said they'll turn around
and step in your shoes
so you better keep an eye on your close friend
you better watch out for your close friend
don't trust nobody

ever since the day that your life began
wish you had some stronger ties

but they're living in emotional poverty
they use their fronts making deals oh, mighty sharp
there's no love and they're bankrupt in the heart
sky above and earth below
you can't hide, there's no place you can go
from yourself you can't run
when truth hurts it's not much fun

he sweetly kissed my lips
last time i saw him
he said:""i'll be back for more of this""
last time i saw him
we were crying at the bus
i knew he hated leaving
but he had to set us up
i gave him money
i know i invested well
mamma doesn't trust him
but he loves me i can tell
each time the greyhound
arrives at nine o' clock
but i don't start my crying
'till that last man's gotten off
last time i saw him
last time i saw my honey
last time i saw him
he was greyhound bound
but i'm still waiting here
without a fear
that bus will someday turn around
i had no letter
it's been six months, maybe better
i try forgetting him
but i love him more then ever
i have decided
i've waited long enough
if there was nothing wrong
he would return right on that bus
there must be trouble
so i'm leavin' on the double
if he can't get to me
i know he needs me desperately
last time i saw him
last time i saw my honey
last time i saw him
he was looking fine
and as he waved goodbye
he said don't cry
i'm coming back, no rain or shine
last time i saw him
last time i saw my honey
last time i saw him
he was greyhound bound
and as he waved goodbye
he said don't cry
i'm coming back, no rain or shine

the world was younger than i
as merry as a carousel

sit there and count your fingers
what can you do?
oh girl you're through
all you can count on are your fingers
unlucky little girl blue
sit there and count the raindrops
falling on you
it's time you knew
all you can count on are the raindrops
that fall on little girl blue
no use oh girl
you may as well surrender
your hope is getting slender
why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
to cheer little girl blue"

i knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
to be without the simple things

don't think i don't want to please ya

and i don't know where you've been
there gets to be a question in my mind

don't want to fall asleep without you
don't wanna wake
don't wanna wake up when you're gone

you've got someone else in love with you

you've been laying our
love on the line

love undermined
no ammunition
i don't wanna love you paralyzed
i don't wanna love you paralyzed
some misty morning
when she does the same to you
when she makes you feel like i do
that's the day
but she can't have you
she can't build a wall around you
she can't love you like i love you anyway
i know by midnight if you leave me
and no lies can make the difference
more hearts get broken now than need be
and it's right to face the woman
that steal the away man
if there's anything to get you back
that i must do i can
and our love will never be
love on the line
that's my suspicion
when i can see her in your eyes
love undermined
i'm on a mission
i don't wanna love you paralyzed
i don't wanna love you paralyzed
and my life i won't surrender
and i'll find out where you go
there's someone else in love with you

i enjoyed the picture show
when you walked me to my door
i knew i wanted more
when i asked you in
it was already getting late
though i knew better
i didn't eaven hesitate
i like the way you hold me
and make me feel so good
though i say i wouldn't
you kinda knew that i would
it's been so long since i've
been with a man
better ask myself
while i still can
is this love or is it just loneliness
when the sun comes up is this something we will both regret
is this love or is it just loneliness
we ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it
and how about you
do you really want me
or am i just here
to please your masculinity
you don't see me emough
to let me know you care
you know the worst thing for a woman
is a sometime love affair
seems like every time
i satisfy your needs
you don't call me back
for two or three weeks
what am i gonna do
i just can't fight
the temptation of loving you
is this love or is it just loneliness
when the sun comes up is this something we will both regret
is this love or is it just loneliness
we ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it
sometimes it's hard
to tel the difference
i'm just not sure
if it's worth it
is this love or is it just loneliness
when the sun comes up is this something we will both regret
is this love or is it just loneliness
we ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it
'cause you never show up 'til midnight
then you go home early
now you know that ain't right
i've got a question i wanna ask you
do you really love me or am i just a fool
is this love or is it just loneliness
when the sun comes up is this something we will both regret
is this love or is it just loneliness
we ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it"
"i like your brother
i like your mother
and i like you !
i like you too
we'll get a preacher
a preacher already ?
i'll buy the ring
and we can hire a band
with a violin and an accordeon
and a tenor who can sing
you and me, you and me, baby
you and me...
we'll have a kid
oh... we may have to rent one
he's got to be straight
'cause we don't want a bent one
we sure want no bent one
he will drink his baby booze
from a big breast cup
someday he'll may be president
if things loosen up
you and me, you and me, baby
you and me...
when our kids are grown
with kids of their own
they'll send us away
to a little home in florida
where we can play checkers
playin' checkers can be fun
you and me, you and me, baby
you and me..."
"i knew from the first time i saw you
i wanted you for myself
you feel the same though it's got to be wrong
we each belong to somebody else
once it was vague desire
now it's a raging fire
those things that people are saying
can't keep our love on the shelf
how long can we talk about it
what good is life without it
love will make it right
love will make it right
love will choose the night
love will make it right
four friends are driving on sunday
our smiles a useless disguise
by now they know what's inside our hearts
my sweet, it shows in your eyes
through all the foolish laughter
they know just what we're after
how long can we keep on living
this life of unspoken lies
some will be touched with sadness
but how can we stop the madness
love will make it right
love will make it right
love will choose the night
love will make it right
some will be touched with sadness
but how can we stop the madness
love will make it right
love will make it right
love will choose the night
love will make it right"
"when i wake up in the morning love
and the sun light hurts my eyes

bears heavy on my mind.

a lovely day

just to call you my own

that the thrill of romance
can be like a heavenly dream

with the prayer
that you'll make love to me
strange as it seems
someday we'll meet
and you'll dry all my tears
then whisper sweet little things in my ears

the bitter wind was blowin' around me
i'd sit and cry but
by and by it just faded away
rainbow, painted skies,
brought a smile into my eyes
the scent of flowers filled the air
i turned around and you were there
hey, you made me see
that love is the key
to make the sun shine
for me
ooh, since you came
i feel like lovin' again
i feel like livin' again
and i feel like givin' again
ooh ooh, since you came
i feel like lovin' again
and i feel like livin' again
and i feel like givin' again
one kiss is worth a thousand sighing words
when you're lonely
i saw you smile
it was warm
now i see beyond the storm
clouds are fading fast
there goes the sad and bitter past
you touched my life
when no one cared
you did the things that no one dared
you've opened doors
you've made me see
that love is the key
to make the sun shine
for me
ooh, since you came
i feel like lovin' again
and i feel like livin' again

how still we see thee lie!
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shineth
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight
for christ was born of mary
and gathered all above
while mortals sleep, the angels keep
their watch of wond'ring love
o morning stars together
proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth
o holy child of bethlehem
descend to us, we pray
cast out our sin and enter in
be born in us today
we hear the christmas angels
the great glad tidings tell
o come to us, abide in us

not realizing all the value you had
i took a happy ending and made it sad
the day i walked away and left you alone
with hardly an explanation
you stood on your own
and handled the situation
and showed to me
how understanding you could be
now i'm alone
looking back at all the years that we shared
thinking of the pain you should have been spared
afraid to ask forgiveness
but where can i go
there's no one else to turn to
i still have my pride

and come to you with honesty
give me just one more chance
such a simple thing i'm asking for
just one more chance
it would be a shame to close the door to
one more chance
isn't that what we pray each night for?
one more chance
isn't that what we're fighting for?
why throw away a love that needs one more chance
now i'm afraid that after all i've said
you'll still turn me down and you'll smile
and say i'll see you around
but remember that you still have a choice
and i hope and pray you'll make it
you'll think of my heart
and you won't wanna break it
and i'll prove to you the kind of lady i can be

come true when i looked at you

you too might be
overjoyed, over loved, over me

i had found what i've searched to discover
i've come much too far for me now to find

hapiness you took from me
and left me alone
with only memories
through the mirror of my mind
through these tears that i'm crying
reflects a hurt i can't control
'cause although you're gone
i keep holding on
to the happy times
oh, when you were mine
as i peer through the window
of lost time
looking over my yesterdays
and all the love i gave all in vain
 all the love
that i've waisted
 all the tears
that i've taisted
all in vain
through the hollow of my tears
i see a dream that's lost
from the hurt
that you have caused
everywhere i turn
seems like everything i see
reflects the love that used to be
in you i put
all my faith and trust
right before my eyes
my world has turned to dust
after all the nights
i sat alone and wept
just a handful of promisses
are all that's left of loving you

the way life used to be

"selfish one, why keep your love to yourself
it's like a souvenir that just sits on a shelf
it seems like you built a fence around your heart
afraid that sharing might tear it apart
you pass up every chance at the start of romance
selfish one, why keep your love in store
you think it's still that keeps forever more
you feel as i do when i ache
my heart could break down in a lonely stage
you better let your heart find a mate before it's too late
you let so much time pass by
i find myself still giving you the eye
you must have realised much to my surprise
you're making eyes at me
is it really you
now selfish one, you're walking me to my door
selfish one, you never did this before
without a chance to resist, your lips get mine
you're beginning to let your love light shine
i can see that you're really on the ball
you're not selfish at all
no, not at all
the way you hold me, the way you squize me
no you're not selfish
no, no, no
you're not selfish at all, not at all
the way you hold me, the way you squize me
you're not selfish at all
no not at all
the way you hold me
you're not selfish at all"

plagued with memories i can't forget us
trying to fight it
trying to hide it

your love it shines
in a cruel hard world
it's a miracle to find
someone good
someone whose love it shines
your love it shines
here in this appartment with oh too many rooms
pearls once meant something they brought me only gloom
trying to fight it
trying to hide it
rekindled flames are not recommended
but it never went out boy
it never ended
crime can fight it
lies can hide it
your love it shines
in a cruel hard world
it's a miracle to find
someone good
someone whose love it shines
your love it shines
you'd better shine it up
you'd better shine it up
you'd better shine it up
you'd better shine it up
in a cruel hard world
it's a miracle to find
someone good
someone whose love it shines
your love it shines"

scent of magnolias sweet and fresh

cause when you shook me, took me out of my world
i woke up, suddenly i just woke up to the happening.
when you find that you left the future behind
cause when you got a tender love you don t
take care of, then you better beware of the happening.
one day you re up, then you turn around
you find your world is tumbling down
it happened to me and it can happen to you.
i was sure, i felt secure, until love took a detour
yeah, riding high on top of the world
it happened, suddenly it just happened.
i saw my dreams fall apart, when love walked away from my heart
and when you lose that precious love you need to guide you
something happens inside you, the happening.
now i see life for what it is
it s not all dreams, it s not all bliss
it happened to me and it can happen to you
once!
ooo, and then it happened
ooo, and then it happened
ooo, and then it happened
ooo, and then it happened.
is it real, is it fake, is this game of life a mistake
cause when i lost the love i thought was mine
for certain, suddenly i started hurting.
i saw the light too late, when that fickle finger of fate
yeah came and broke my pretty balloon
i woke up, suddenly i just walked up to the happening.
so sure, i felt secure, until love took a detour
cause when you got a tender love you don t
take care of, then you better beware of the happening."

the last time that you'll touch me in the morning

leave me as you found me, empty like before
wasn't it yesterday
we used to laugh at the wind behind us?
didn't we run away and hope
that time wouldn't try to find us didn't we take each other
to a place where no one's ever been?
yeah, i really need you near me tonight

with the sun in my eyes

stand up, stand tall, and be counted
divided we fall, together we stand, together
our love has all never doubt it
alone we fall, together we stand, together
on the stage of a theatre
a production of all the feelings
that we're feeling all surrounding us
in the words of a playwright
one is not enough
to experience the act called love
called trust called love called trust"
"ooh, what a little moonlight can do
ooh, what a little moonlight can do to you
you're in love
your hearts a flutter
and all day long you only shutter
'cause your poor tongue
just won't utter the words ""i love you""
ooh, what a little moonlight can do
wait a while
'till the little moonbeams comes peeking through
you get bold
you can't resist him
all you say
when you kissed him is
ooh, what a little moonlight can do"
"""this is a song
it's about our world
it's about our environment""

what a wonderful...
""you say it""

just follow where they lead
in your dreams you found the lock
in your prayers you'll find the key
my love will guide you
high above the stars
in dreams you can do many wonderful things
even find out who you are
when you dream i'll be there
just picture me in your mind
when you're scared
i'll take care of you
when you dream i'll be there
if you need someone to hold
hold on to me
that's all you have to do
to make you dreams come true
dreams can be magic
if the truth is what you seek
open up your heart
and you'll be forever free
when you dream
and tell the bad dreams
to just go away..."

"where did we go wrong
i thought that we were supposed to make it
where did we go wrong
how could life give us love, then take it away
alone again today
remembering when
we were a brand new morning
we weren't afraid to feel
all that we asked was somewhere to hide
we were like happy children
reaching out to touch everything that's real
we believed in love 'cause our lives were touching inside
and baby, remember the things we needed
the summers and the winters and springs we needed
the feeling we would fly and on wings we needed to share
remember the people how few we needed
we always had the me and the you we needed
if every little thing that we knew we needed to care was there
then where did we go wrong
and isn't time supposed to heal me?
where did we go wrong
and can a part of you still feel me
as much as yesterday
a touch a world away
we were the time of crystal
shining for love to see
both of us gave the things we receive
we were like hungry people
as i gave to you so you gave to me
believing in our love 'cause we love the things we believe
baby, remember the dreams we needed
the nights we couldn't sleep and these dreams we needed
so we could find the time for what it seems we needed to say
remember the touches to show we needed
to keep our love and keep our love the glow we needed
and being here without you i know we needed to stay
that way
but where did we go wrong
i thought that we were supposed to make it
where did we go wrong
how could life give us love, then take it away
where did we go wrong
i thought that we were supposed to make it
where did we go wrong
where did we go wrong
where did we go wrong
where did we go wrong"
"where there was darkness
you came and now there's
an abundance of light
nothing but sinkin' sand
suddenly i reach out
there's your hand
what a feeling it is to know
you're in my corner
and you won't let me go
and now i know that
i won't be alone no more
i'll give you all i have
and if you teach me
i will learn to give you more
you are my anchor now
and like a ship at sea
ooh, your love will steady me
what a feeling this is to know
you're in my corner
and you won't let me go
and now i know that
i won't be alone no more
i'm so glad
just wanna thank you baby
what a feeling this is to know
you're in my corner
and you won't let me go
what a feeling this is to know
you're in my corner

who washed away the colors in my life again
who left my lover in the rain
who washed away the colors in my life
there's no use crying, trying hard
what else can i do
but he becomes another man
another case of fool
why go on living and giving up
much more than i receive
its taken time to realize
but now i've opened my eyes to you
who left my lover in the rain
who washed away the colors in my life again
who left my lover in the rain
who washed away the colors in my life
but who is right, who was wrong
when love just fades away
it could've been me, it could've been you
but now i never find out who
who left my lover in the rain
who washed away the colors in my life again
who left my lover in the rain
who washed away the colors in my life again
who left my lover in the rain"

love is a losing game
love can be a shame

"over the ground lies a mantle of white
a heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
two hearts are thrillin'
in spite of the chill in the weather, ooh the weather
love knows no season, love knows no clime
romance can blossom any old time
here in the open
we're walkin' and hopin' together
together, together, together
sleigh bells ring, are you list'nin?
in the lane, snow is glist'nin'
a beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
walkin' in a winter wonderland
gone away is the blue bird
here to stay is a new bird
he sings a love song, as we go along
walkin' in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
then pretend that he is parson brown
he'll say ""are you married?""
we'll say ""no man!
but you can do the job when you're in town""
later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid, the plans that we've made
walkin' in a winter wonderland
walkin' in a winter wonderland
walkin' in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
and pretend that he's a circus clown
we'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
until the other kiddies knock him down
when it snows ain't it thrillin'
tho' your nose gets a chillin'
we'll frolic and play, the eskimo way
walkin' in a winter wonderland
walkin' in a winter wonderland"

how much more can i take
before loneliness will cause my heart
heart to break?
no i can't bear to live my life alone
i grow impatient for a love to call my own
but when i feel that i, i can't go on
these precious words keeps me hangin' on
i remember mama said:
you can't hurry love
no, you just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
it's a game of give and take
you can't hurry love
no, you just have to wait
she said trust, give it time
no matter how long it takes
gotta wait!
no, love, love, don't come easy
but i keep on waiting
anticipating for that soft voice
to talk to me at night
for some tender arms
to hold me tight
i keep waiting
i keep on waiting
but it ain't easy
it ain't easy
but mama said:
you can't hurry love
no, you just have to wait
she said to trust, give it time
no matter how long it takes
you can't hurry love
no, you just have to wait
she said love don't come easy
it's a game of give and take"
"you can't win
you can't break even
and you can't get out of the game
people keep sayin'
things are gonna change
but they look just like they're staying the same
you get in
way over your head
and you've only got yourself to blame
you can't win, chile
you can't break even
and you can't get out of the game
you can't win
the world keeps movin'
and you're standin' far behind
people keep sayin'
things 'll get better
just to ease your state of mind
so you lay back
and you smoke that smoke
and you drink your glass of wine
you can't win, chile
you can't break even
and you can't get out of the game
you can't win
you can't win
no way if your story stays the same
you ain't winnin'
but it's nice to see you
i'm awfully glad you came
better cool it
'cause it ain't about losin'
then the world has got no shame
you can't win, chile
you can't break even
and you can't get out of the game
you can't win
you can't win
you can't break even
ain't the way
it's supposed to be
you'll be spendin'
your little bit of money
while someone else ride free
learn your lesson, refuel your mind
before some turkey blows out your flame"
"you don't have to say
i love you everyday
you do it
and you don't have to try
to keep me satisfied
you do it
look what you have done
you're the only one
who can take me away
and when you can't be mine
i spend all my time
just waiting
till you came back around
'cause no one else i found
can do it
the way you do it to me
when you love me baby
when i need to feel
the way i love to feel
you do it
i can't live without
the way you know how
to do it
tell me what did i do right
to get you in my life
when i need you
need you to stay
at times it almost seems
i stepped into a dream
and you hold me
i guess i'm tryin' to say
can't do without the way
you do it
the way you do it to me
when you love me baby
i really do love the way that you do it to me
what did i do right
to get you in my life
when i need you
need you to stay
at times it almost seems
i step into a dream
and you hold me
i guess i'm tryin' to say
can't do without the way
you do it
the way you do it to me
when you love me baby
you don't have to say
i love you everyday
you do it
and you don't have to try
to keep me satisfied
you do it"
"warmer than sunshine, baby
sweeter than tears
that's how my life has been
since you first appeared
you opened up my heart
to everything fine
you put a light inside me
and you made me shine
from the time i met you everything came true
all i ever dreamed
i found in you
ooh, you got it
there's no way
i'm gonna live without it
nothin' can stop it
i'm all yours
'cause baby you got it all
you keep me movin' baby
to the beat of your drum
i love what you're doin'
and where you're comin' from
and when you hold me baby
it's like we are one
'cause you got a motion
that gets me all undone
when you took my life and turned it all around
ooh, you got me flying
don't take me down
ooh, you got it
there's no way
i'm gonna live without it
nothin' can stop it
i'm all yours
'cause baby you got it all
you know i can't control
for what i feel in my soul
my heart is full of you
all i wanna do is to love you

"set me free, why don't cha babe
get out my life, why don't cha babe
'cause you don't really love me
you just keep me hangin' on
you don't really need me
but you keep me hangin' on
why do you keep a coming around
playing with my heart?
why don't you get out of my life
and let me make a new start?

'cause you don't really love me
you just keep me hangin' on
now you don't really want me
you just keep me hangin' on
you say although we broke up
you still wanna be just friends
but how can we still be friends
when seeing you only breaks my heart again
and there ain't nothing i can do about it
woo, set me free, why don't cha babe
woo, get out my life, why don't cha babe
set me free, why don't cha babe
get out my life, why don't cha babe
you claim you still care for me
but your heart and soul needs to be free
now that you've got your freedom
you wanna still hold on to me
you don't want me for yourself
so let me find somebody else hey!
why don't you be a man about it
and set me free
now you don't care a thing about me
you're just using me
go on, get out, get out of my life
and let me sleep at night
'cause you don't really love me
you just keep me hangin' on..."
"yes i believe in fairy tales
and all my favorites come true
the handsome prince rides in
and he sweeps me of my feet
and then it turns out to be you
baby, i am the romantic kind
but you're the hero in my eyes
i knew when you walked into the room
you were the one, you were the one
you are bringing me the sun and the moon
you were the one, you were the one
though i don't think that it was just by chance
you must have felt it like i did
it was enchantment with just one glance
a fantasy we both can live
into the sunset you and me
just like an old harlequin movie scene
i knew when you walked into the room
you were the one, you were the one
you are bringing me the sun and the moon
you were the one, you were the one
i knew when you walked into the room
you were the one, you were the one
you are bringing me the sun and the moon
you were the one
it was you, yeah
it was you
it was you
i knew when you walked into the room
it was you
you are bringing me the sun and the moon
it was you, yeah, you were the one
you are bringing me the sun and the moon
you are the one, you are the one
i knew when you walked into the room
you were the one, you were the one
you are bringing me the sun and the moon
you were the one, you were the one"
"both: that special tear i shed means youâ€™re a part of me
thoughts of you running through my head mean youâ€™re a part of me
yeah, iâ€™m satisfied to know youâ€™re a part of me
marvin: what i want to say is

just as simple as the last rerun
marvin: what i want to say is
diana: all i want to say is
both: that i love you â€˜cause youâ€™re that very special part of me
marvin: oh when the morning comes i wipe the sleep from my eyes
well i canâ€™t walk away from what i feel inside
both: canâ€™t find the cure for not having you around marvin: oh iâ€™ve searched far and near ah
but the cure just canâ€™t be found no no no
both: that special cure just out of reach means youâ€™re a special part of me

"when i was just a little girl
i wanted the world at my feet
now all that's changed
'cause i have love
and now i do can see
you're all i need to get by
like the sweet morning dew
i took one look at you
and it was plain to see
you were my destiny
with arms open wide
i threw away my pride
i'll sacrifice for you
dedicate my life to you
i will go, where you lead
always there in time of need
and when you lose your will
i'll be there to push you up the hill
there's no, no looking back for us
we've got love
sure enough
that's enough
you're all i need to get by
all, you're all i need to get by
like an mother protects his nest
for you i'll do my best
stand by you like a tree
dare anybody to try to move me
darling in you i found
strength where i was torn down
don't know what's in store
but together we can open any door
just to do what's good for you
and inspire you a little higher
i know you can make a woman
out of a soul that didn't have a goal
'cause we, we got the right foundation
and with love and determination
you're all i want to strive for and do a little more
all, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into
you're all i need to get by
all, you're all i need to get by"
"we have been together much too long

what i'll do
when i say i do

think it's time for us to set a date
so much harder for us both to wait, so long
it's getting strong
and i can't hold it
i know this kind of love is heaven sent
and i've got faith that this was always meant to be
you and me
and i can't wait to show you
what i'll do
when i say i do

when i say i do
i'll do it just for you
you're gonna love it
i've got a vision
of passion's burning fire
i've made a decision
to give you all your desire
i've been thinking 'bout loving you
all night, all day, ain't gonna give you a break
our honeymoon will last forever
i hope that you're in shape
for what i'll do
so what you want me to do?
i know this kind of love is heaven sent

"you've changed
that sparkle in your eyes is gone
your smile is just a careless yawn
you're breaking my heart
you've changed
you've changed
your kiss is now so blase
you're bored with me in every way
i can't understand
you've changed
you've forgotten the words
i love you
each memory that we've shared
you ignore every star above you
i can't realise you ever cared
you've changed
you're not the angel i once knew
no need to tell me that we're through
you've changed"
"sometimes when i'm sitting all alone
i think of things that i have done
and start to wonder if there's one thing
that means more than others i have known
and suddenly it's clear to me
without your love where would i be
your love has kept me going
through good and bad times
it's kept me growing
like a steady flame
your love has kept on burning
through sweet and sad times
i'll keep returning to the magic of your love
through the years my dreams may come and go
for fortune is a fleeting time
and no one knows what time may bring
but through the highs and lows of it i'll know
that there's one thing of which i'm sure
the one thing i've been living for
your love has kept me going
through good and bad times
it's kept me growing
like a steady flame
your love has kept on burning
through sweet and sad times
i'll keep returning to the magic of your love
your love has kept me going
through good and bad times
it's kept me growing
like a steady flame
your love has kept on burning
through sweet and sad times
i'll keep returning to the magic of your love
i'll keep returning to the magic of your love
your love"
"your love is so good for me
your love is so good for me
every day you're on my mind
wanna be near you all the time
you made my poem rhyme
and my heart began to sing again
the day your eyes met mine
your love is so good for me
your love is so good for me
two hearts just running free
like a wind song through the trees
your love does not possess
it just holds me where i wanna be
with binds of tenderness
your love is so good for me
your love is so good for me
baby, you know your love is so good
it's good
you know it's good
like a star up in the sky
burning brightly, you and i
time will tell if love survives
for we only have today
and today love is alive
your love is so good for me
your love is so good for me
it's so good
you know your love is so good,
so good for me...
it's so good
no need to say the words
when you touch me they will be heard
you gave so much to me
and you showed me how to love the way
true love was meant to be
your love is so good for me
your love is so good for me"
