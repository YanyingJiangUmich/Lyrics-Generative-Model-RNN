"you say you're sorry once again dear
you want me to take you back once more
you say you need a helping hand dear
but that's what you told me once before
walk softly on this heart of mine love
don't treat it mean and so unkind
let it rest in peace and quiet love
walk softly on this heart of mine
i know you soon will find a new love
i feel your heart is turned to stone
but please let me down real easy
for loneliness moves in as you move on"
"each day i'll do a golden deed by helping those who are in need 
my life on earth is but a span and so i'll do 
chorus:
life's evening sun is sinking low a few more days and i must go 
too meet the deed that i have done where there will be 
while travelling down life's weary road i'll try to lessen some travellers load 
i'll try to turn the nights to day make flowers bloom 
repeat chorus"
"a star fell from heaven right into my arms
a brighter star i know i've never seen
then i found out that it was only you with all your charms
who came into my life to fill a dream
a fallen star is what you are
the twinkle in your eyes came from the sky
you must have strayed from the milky way
a fallen star that's what you are
the heavens must be lonely now that you are mine
i'm sure they'll miss a star as bright as you
but the stars will send there blessing and brighter they will shine
when they see the dream that's comin' true"
"i was a rover, on land and on sea
'til a good woman's love made a new man of me
life had no meaning, it was so incomplete
'til a good woman's love put me back on my feet
still a roamin' i go home in the evening and she's waiting there
and i know that no matter what happens she'll always care
and when night falls and the moon shines above
i'm a man with a dream and a good woman's love"
"i bid farewell to my home so dear
and started down life's road
i was a fortune seeking miner dear
many things had been my goal
there's many things i've seen in life
i thought i'd like to roam
but i'd give them all and more if i
could get off this lonesome road
it's a lonesome road to travel on
many miles of sorrow is all i've know
but i've gone too far to turn back now
from this lonesome lonesome road
i left behind a love that's true
she cried and begged me not to go
but my foolish pride told me what to do
and put me on this lonesome road
oh such lonely nights i've never found
no time in life before
if she takes me back i'll settle down
and travel this road no more"
"i hear a voice callin'
it must be our lord
it's comin' from heaven on high
i hear a voice callin'
i'll gain the reward
in the land where we shall never shall die
the savior has paid a great price for me
he gave his life on calvary
so i'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
and be ready to meet him when he calls on that day
he died on the cross
the old rugged cross
that we would be saved from sin and not lost
so i'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
and we'll pay that debt on the great judgement day"
"i wish to the lord i'd never been born
or died when i was young
i never would have seen your sparkling blue eyes
or heard your lying tongue
all the good times are past and gone
all the good times are o'er
all the good times are past and gone
little darling don't weep no more
don't you see that turtle dove
that flies from pine to pine
he's mourning for his own true love
just like i mourn for mine
come back, come back my own true love
and stay awhile with me
for if ever i've had a friend in this world
you've been that friend to me"

while sailing oe'r life's rugged plain
the clouds are dark the day is dreary
it seems
angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
bear me over the deep to heaven above
when the shadows shall fall and the savior shall call
angels rock me to sleep in the cradle of love
there is no earthly friend to guide me
no one to call to heaven's goal
but christ the savior stands beside me
to cheer and comfort my poor soul
at last the harbor i am nearing
i see the lights along the shore
i hear my friends and loved ones cheering
i'll soon be safe for ever more"

blue night i can't keep from crying
you met someone that was new
you quit someone that you knew was true

where we used to walk i walk alone
with an aching heart because my love is gone
blue night blue as i can be
blue night 'cause i'm all alone
i used to call you on the telephone
i used to call and it made you glad
now i call and it makes you mad
blue night 'cause i'm all alone
blue night all by myself
since you put me on that shelf
there's just one thing that you must know
you're gonna reap just what you sow

"see that train coming round the bend,
carrying the one that i love
her beautiful body is still here on earth,
but her soul has been called up above
body and soul, body and soul,
that's how she loved me, with body and soul
her beautiful hair was the purest of gold,
her eyes were as blue as the sea,
her lips were the color of summer's red rose,
and she promised she would always love me
tomorrow as the sun sinks low
the shadows will cover her face
as her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground
and my teardrops are falling like rain"
"i'm breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
don't look at me like you think i've got the blues
'cause i'm walking 'round and around and i'm seeing most of the town
i'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
ah ha so i'm talking to myself
oh no she's not putting me on the shelf
i'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
i'm doggone if i'm gonna cry the blues
my feet are sore but i've got no time to lose
'cause i'm wanting her here with me and i'm needing her company
i'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes"
"i'm only a dreamer of romance
my love dreams can never come true
i'll just pretend that i'm happy
and smile thru these tears dear at you
i dreamed of a cabin of love dear
where all of our dreams would come true
but another has taken my cabin
and left me so lonely and blue
nestled around my cabin
that means all the world to me
our love sweet heart will always linger
for you are a part dear of me
where is the love we once cherished
why didn't our love dreams come true
all i can do now is dream dear
of a cabin sweetheart dear and you"
"the days are long the nights are lonely
since you left me all alone
i worried so my little darling
i worried so since you've been gone
sweetheart of mine can't you hear me calling
a million times that i love you best
i mistreated you, darling, i'm sorry
come back to me is my request
i remember dear the night we parted
a big mistake had caused it all
if you come back sunshine will follow
if you stay away twill be my fall
the nights are long my little darling
oh how i need your sweet embrace
when i awoke the sun was shining
i looked up and i saw your face"
"moon moon i can see you smilin' low
you made me think of a sweetheart
a little girl that i loved so
after i've wondered the whole night through
wonderin' if you think of me
while i'm on my lonesome thinkin' of someone
i'm thinkin' only of you
my carolina sunshine girl
you have turned my heart to stone
my carolina sunshine girl
you have left me all alone
i wonder why i sit and cry
when i really should laugh
at your little old photograph
for you're the sweetest angel in this world
and i love love love you
my carolina sunshine girl"
"we were waltzing together to a dreamy melody
when they called out change partners and you waltzed away from me
now my arms feel so empty as i gaze upon the floor
and i'll keep on changing partners 'til i hold you once more
though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part
in that wonderful moment something happened to my heart
so i'll keep changing partners 'til you're in my arms and then
oh my darlin' i will never change partners again"
"snowflakes falling my old home is calling
tall pines are humming christmas time is coming.
can't you hear them bells ringin' ringin' joy to all here them singin'
let it snow and i'll be going back to my country home

christmas times a' coming and i know i'm going home.
holly's in the window home where the wind blows
can't walk for running christmas time is coming.
home fires burning my heart's yearning
for the folks at home when christmas time is coming."
"you've gone so far away, my darling
each time i think of you i cry
i press your picture to my bosom
then i feel that you're close by
years have passed you've not returned dear
now they say that you have died
but your soul will live forever
now i know you'll be close by
i saw you last while you were leaving
the tears from you i tried to hide
you took me in your arms and said dear
your memory i keep close by
they buried you in a lonely graveyard
and a spot they left beside
there i'll sleep 'till jesus calls us
so that we can be close by"

want to be back in tennessee
way down in columbus stockade
friends all turned their backs on me

never let it cross your mind

leave me little darling, i don't mind
last night as i lay sleeping
i dreamt i held you in my arms
when i awoke i was mistaken
i was peering through the bars
many a night with you i've rambled
many an hour with you i've spent
thought i had your heart forever
now i find it's only lent"
"oh, i'm sending a prayer up to heaven
on a beautiful cloud you see
so you will know that i want you
in my beautiful memories and dreams
come back to me in my dreams love
come back to me in sweet dreams
i'm heartbroke i'm sad and i'm weary
come back to me in my dreams
when the bright moon shines up in heaven
and the beautiful stars are a'gleam
it seems that you are so near me
but yet it is only a dream
it seems i'll never more see you
till we meet in heaven it seems
but i hold you close to my heart love
in my beautiful memories and dreams"
"come go with me to yonder valley
where we once stood beneath the tree
where we once planned our life together
i can't forget come go with me
come let us live some moments over
then maybe you won't want to leave
i love you then and will forever
i can't forget come go with me
i can't forget the flowers blooming
the rose that i pick for you
time changed you but i'm not changing
i loved you then and i still do
come go with me to yonder valley
where on the largest of the trees
i'll carve your name to prove i love you
i can't forget come go with me
i love you then and i still do"

"i walked out tonight for a ramble round
i didn't mean to stay just to view the town
when i saw her smiling from afar
as she walked into that crossroads bar
well i walked inside and sat me down
ordered sweet red wine and i drank it down
she came and set beside me there
with a dark brown eyes and the red, red hair
i told her that i loved her true
anything you want i'll surely do
said a man like you don't get too far
with a girl like me at the crossroads bar
i like smoky light and a lonesome song
and i won't do right if i can do wrong
you want the moon to burn behind the darkest star
and you won't find love at the crossroads bar
come all my friends and take my advice
keep your love at home with your lovely wife
you're better off than you think you are
and you won't find love at the crossroads bar"
"cry cry darling
that's what i'll do if you should leave me with the blues
cry cry darling
that's all i do cause you're the one that's in my heart
for me there'll be no moonlight
if ever we should part
cry cry darling, that's all i do
cause you're the one that's in my heart
cry cry darling
my eyes will cry and never dry if you should go
cry cry darling
when shadows creep i'll just weep all night i know
you know how much i'd miss you
if ever we should part
cry cry darling
that's all i do cause you're the one that's in my heart"
"chorus:)
crying holy unto my lord
crying holy unto my lord
oh, if i could i surely would
stand on the rock where moses stood
sinners run and hide your face
sinners run and hide your face
go and run into the rocks and hide your face
'cause i ain't no stranger now
lord, i ain't no stranger now
lord, i ain't no stranger now
i've been introduced to the father and the son
and, i ain't no stranger now
(repeat chorus 2x"
"i went downtown thought i had a dime
got home this morning didn't have a dime
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin' i got the dog house blues.
come home this morning about half past eight
she said honey you're out too late
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin' i got the dog house blues.
i went in the house to start the fire
she kicked me out in the middle of the night
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin' i got the dog house blues.
i fell in the yard mad as i can be
said to my dog make room for me
lordy lordy lordy got the dog house blues
no use talkin' i got the dog house blues."
"you have no doubt in your mind
there's a heaven up above
and you mean to change before the end
but you hold onto treasures
you possessed here on earth
feasting your soul on sin
don't put off 'til tomorrow what you can do today
for tomorrow may be too late
sinner give your heart to jesus won't you kneel down and pray
for tomorrow may be too late
you say you'll change tomorrow
but tomorrow never comes
these words you keep repeating everyday
how sad will be the story
when you're laid in your grave
in torment forever you will pay
there's a wreck on the highway
there's blood on the road
that lifeless body lies cold
they'll never know jesus
they've waited too long
they'll never live in that heavenly fold"
"in the shadow of the pines
lives a girl and i know that she is mine
life's worth livin' any time
down in caroline.
it's no matter where i roam
she'll be waitin' there i know
and i'll find that gal of mine
down in caroline
she is waiting there for me
soon her smile i know i will see
she's all mine where i can be
down in caroline
curly hair and eyes of blue
and a heart of love all for you
and i know her love is true
down in caroline
arms that hold me close and tight
and lips that kiss me goodnight
and i know her love is right
down in caroline"
"down in the willow garden where me and my love did meet
there we sat a courting my love fell off to sleep
i had a bottle of burgundy wine which my true love did not know
and there i poisoned that dear little girl down by the banks below
i drew my saber through her which was a bloody knife
i threw her in the river which was an awful sight
my father often told me that money would set me free
if i would murder that dear little miss whose name was rose connelly
now he sits by his old cabin door a wiping his tear brimmed eyes
mourning for his only son out on the scaffold high
my race is run beneath the sun the devil is waiting for me
for i did murder that dear little girl whose name was rose connelly"
"out on the perilous deep
where dangers silently creep
and storms so violently sweep
you're drifting too far from the shore
drifting too far from the shore
drifting too far from the shore
come to jesus today, let him show you the way
drifting too far from the shore
today the tempest rolls high
and clouds overshadow the sky
sure death is hovering nigh
drifting too far from the shore"
"farther along we'll know more about it
farther along we'll understand why
cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
we'll understand it all by and by
tempted and tried will oft make you wonder
why it should be thus all the day long
while there are others living about us
never molested though in the wrong
when death has found and taken our loved ones
leaving our home so lonely and dreary
then do we wonder why others prosper
living so wicked year after year"
"springtime is near my darling
you say that you are going away
my heart will be with you my darling
and i?m counting now the days
i know that soon i?ll have to travel
i know i?m over the hill
i feel so all alone my darling said she?d be gone
when i heard that first whippoorwill
the flowers are blooming little darling
with the budding of the trees
i hear the night birds a crying
i know that they are warning me
our love was planted little darling
just like the farmer plants his grain
but there will never be a harvest
on the hills the whippoorwills now sing"
"now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
but give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
for i found her when the snow on the ground
i traced her little footprints in the snow
i found her little footprints in the snow
i bless that happy day when nellie lost her way
for i found her when the snow was on the ground
i dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
i found her little footprints and i traced them in the snow
i found her when the snow was on the ground
now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
i know i'm going to meet her in that promised land
but every time the snow falls it brings back memories
for i found her when the snow was on the ground"
"one night while out for a ramble
the hour was just about nine
i met a young maiden in frisco
on the corner of geary and pine
on her face there was beauty of nature
and her eyes just seemed to expand
her hair was so rich and so brilliant
entwined in a blue velvet band
we strolled down the street together
in my pocket she placed her small hand
she planted the evidence on me
the girl in the blue velvet band
i heard the scream of the siren
and the girl in the blue velvet band
she left me to face all the trouble
with a diamond that was worth ten grand
they sent me to san quentin for stealing
god knows i'm an innocent man
the guilty one now she lie's dying
the girl in the blue velvet band
last night when bed time was ringin
standing there close to the bars
i fancied i heard a voice calling
far out in the ocean of stars
i'll be out in a year and i'm leaving
but i'll carry the name of a man
that served ten years in prison
for the girl in the blue velvet band
and when i get out i'll endeavor
to live in some other land
and i'll bid farewell to old frisco
and the girl in the blue velvet band"
"along about round up time in texas way out west
i lost a friend and a pal, boys i laid him down to rest
i weeped and moaned over his grave and to me boys it was sad
'cause i knew down beneath that mound lay the best pal i ever had
oh de lady a, de oh lady oh, de ladie
my best pal was my old paint horse and now he's gone to rest
i laid him down beneath that mound in texas away out west
where the cactus blooms over his grave and the coyotes cry
i know he sleeps in perfect peace beneath the texas sky
dear old pal it breaks my heart to leave you here alone
now i'll go and ride the range on the texas roan
but my love for you old pal it shall linger on
i will always think of you although you're dead and gone"
"hallelujah  i'm ready i can hear the voices singing soft and low
hallelujah  i'm ready hallelujah i'm ready to go
in the darkness of night not a star was in site
on a highway that leads down below
but jesus came in and saved this soul from sin
hallelujah i'm ready to go
sinners don't wait before it's too late
he's a wonderful savior you know
well i fell on my knees and he answered my pleas
hallelujah i'm ready to go"
"i want to thank jesus for the way that i feel
i'm so full of religion i just can't be still
i want to sing it and shout it and let the people know
that i'm saved by his mercy and i'm ready to go
 yes i'm happy happy on my way
 his praises everyday
for jesus is near me and there he will stay
 yes i'm happy happy on my way
i just can't see why you sinners go on
livin' in sorrow doin' so wrong
hidin' your face from the savior above
denying yourself his wonderful love
what a wonderful feeling just to know i am saved
and the savior will guide me 'til i enter the grave
and then he will greet me at heaven's open door
and i'll live in glory with him forever more"
"there's a rabbit in the log and i ain't got my dog
how will i get him i know
i'll get me a briar and twist it in his hair
that way i'll get him i know
i know i know that's how i'll get him i know
i'll get me a briar and twist in his hair
that way i'll get him i know
i'll build me a fire and i'll cook that old hare
roll him in the flames and make him brown
have a feast here tonight while the moon is shining bright
and find me a place to lie down
to lie down to lay down find me a place to lie down
have a feast here tonight while the moon is shining bright
and find me a place to lie down
i'm going down the track and my coat ripped up my back
soles on my shoes are nearly gone
a little ways ahead there's an old farmer's shed
that's where i'll rest my weary bones
weary bones lazy bones that's where i'll rest my weary bones
a little way's ahead there's an old farmer's shed
that's where i'll rest my weary bones"
"there's a call that rings from the throne it springs
to those now gone astray
saying ""come ye men from your load of sin
there at the alter lay""
many do not heed that the chains of greed
that their conscience never tire
be assured my friend if you still offend
he will set your fields on fire
now if you don't from sin retire
he will set your fields on fire
you have heard jesus' call
and in death your soul must fall
now my friend if you desire
you may join the heavenly choir
and rejoice with him free from every sin
when he sets this world on fire
you have heard his voice seen his soul rejoice
that trusted in his grace
you have blushed with sin as he knocked within
but still you hide your face
from the blessed lord and his own true word
but still you say retire
leave the downward path kindle not his wrath
or he'll set your fields on fire"
"on saturday night when our work is done
we load our music up on the run
heavy traffic ahead, heavy traffic ahead
we got to ramble ramble there's heavy traffic ahead
we pull out of nashville right on time
the blue grass special heads down the line
we traveled around from state to state
the bluegrass boys are never late
late in the evening about sundown
you know we've come from some other town
we do our work with a good will
on friday night we head for nashville"
"i once had a darling wife kind, true and sweet
life was so bright and g** everything complete
but i fell for another who led my life astray
so i'll live in sorrow till my dying day
down the highway of sorrow i'm traveling alone
i've lost all my true friends i've lost a happy home
i'm heading for destruction i'm on the wrong track
down the highway of sorrow there's no turning back
i went back to my darling i got down on my knees
i begged her with tear rimmed eyes to give my poor heart ease
but she was hurt so deeply she could not forgive
so i'll live in sorrow as i long as i live"
"you left me, my darling to travel alone
my heart is so lonely and blue
when friends ask about you why you're not around
how will i explain about you
how will i explain about you
they know i've been faithful and true
so when they start asking why you're not around
how will i explain about you
they saw us together for such a long time
they knew that i loved you so true
but now that you've gone and i'm left all alone
how will i explain about you
how will i explain about you
i can't let them know that we're through
they wouldn't believe it could ever be true
how will i explain about you
how will i explain about you
i'm leaving it all up to you
and if you insist that our pathway must part
how will i explain about you"
"oh you said that you loved me that your heart would be true
but now you've gone and left me, i'm so blue
i believed in you darling that your heart would be true
but now you've gone and left me, i'm so blue
our vows have been broken, you have proven untrue
another has my sweetheart and the love that i once knew
i believed in you darling that your heart would be true
but now you've gone and left me i'm so blue
oh the nights are so lonely, dreams of you haunt me so
what's happened little darling i don't know
i believed in you darling that your heart would be true
but now you've gone and left me i'm so blue"
"our little girl taken sick one evening
as she walked home from school
and in her death bed soon bring her
it made us so sad and so blue
then she called me close to her bedside
and whispered these words soft and low,
""tell mommy to come to me quickly,
i want to kiss you both then go""
i hear a sweet voice calling
way up in heaven on high
god has made room for you daughter,
oh mommy and daddy don't cry
take care of my little brother
tell him i've gone to rest
i know his little heart is broken
he's all that you have left
then she closed her eyes forever
never to see us no more
until we meet our darling
on that bright and peaceful shore"
"i hear a voice calling
it must be our lord its coming from heaven on high
i hear a voice calling
i've gained a reward for the land where we never shall die
the savior who died, on cruel calvary
he shed his life blood that the world might be free
so follow his footsteps, up the narrow way
and be ready to meet him when he calls on that day
the savior has paid a great price for me
he gave his life on calvary
so i'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
i'll pay my debt on the great judgment day
then she closed her eyes forever
never to see us no more
until we meet our darling
on that bright and peaceful shore"
"the day's are so lonely the night are so long
our home is a prison since you are gone
and i'll always wonder why our love didn't last
with no hope for tomorrow i'll live in the past
a door that won't knock a phone that don't ring
the postman goes by and he don't leave a thing
a pain in my heart and tears in my eyes
my sweetheart has gone i'm left here to cry
i'm the biggest pretender you ever could see
i pretend you still love me false love couldn't be
and then i remember and i know that its true
for your with another and i know i've lost you
i'll just go on dreaming sweet dreams of the past
of when you still love me and i thought it would last
but life is so short and time moves so fast
i'll never forget you as i live in the past"
"i wandered so aimless my heart filled with sin
i wouldn't let my dear savior in
then jesus came like a stranger in the night
praise the lord i saw the light
i saw the light i saw the light
no more darkness no more night
now i'm so happy no sorrow in sight
praise the lord i saw the light
just like a blind man i wandered alone
worries and fears i claimed for my own
then like the blind man that god gave back his sight
praise the lord i saw the light"
"i left my old home in the mountains
and the only friends i ever had
and while i rambled this world over
my heart felt so lonely and sad
iâ€™m going back to the old home
back to the place i love so well
where the sweet waters flow and the wildflowers grow
back to the old home on the hill
i know that dear old motherâ€™s waiting
waiting alone on that hill
with the silver in her hair and a twinkle in her eye
in the old cabin home on the hill
years have gone by since i saw her
iã‚â€™ve traveled many a mile
but tonight thereâ€™s a light in the window
and sheâ€™s waiting at the door with a smile"
"i'll meet you in the morning by the bright riverside
when all sorrow has drifted away
i'll be standin' at the portals when the gates open wide
at the close of life's long weary day
i'll meet you in the morning with a how do you do
and we'll sit down by the river and when all the rapture is renewed
you'll know me in the morning by the smile that i wear
when i meet you in the morning in the city that is built four square
i will meet you in the morning in the sweet by and by
and exchange the old cross for a crown
there will be no disappointments and nobody shall die
in that land when life's sun goeth down"
"the lonesome sigh of a train going by
makes me want to stop and cry
i recall the day it took you away
i'm blue i'm lonesome too
when i hear that whistle blow
i want to pack my suitcase and go
the lonesome sound of a train going by
makes me want to stop and cry
in the still of the night in the pale moonlight
the wind, it moans and cry
these lonesome blues i just can't lose
i'm blue i'm lonesome too"
"i'm going down this lonesome road
to see my fate or victory
god must help us there to win
i'm coming back but i don't know when
i hate to leave my mother dear
my father who is old and gray
but my true love i know you'll wait
for me to come back to me to stay
will you be here when i come home
or will your love fade like a rose
i could never come back should you be gone
my love for you nobody knows"
"i'm going back to old kentucky
there to see my linda lou
i'm going back to old kentucky
where the skies are always blue
when my left old kentucky
linda kissed me and she cried
i told her that i would not linger
i'd be back by and by
linda lou is she is a beauty
those pretty brown eyes i loved so well
i'm going back to old kentucky
never more to say farewell
linda lou you know i love you
i long for you each night and day
when the roses bloom in old kentucky
i'll be coming back to stay"
"back in the days of my childhood
in the evening when everything was still
i used to sit and listen to the foxhounds
with my dad in the old kentucky hills
i'm on my way back to the old home
the road winds on up the hill
but there's no light in the window
that shined long ago where i live
soon my childhood days were over
i had to leave my old home
for dad and mother were called to heaven
i's left in this world all alone
high in the hills of old kentucky
stands the fondest spot in my memory
i'm on my way back to the old home
the light in the window i long to see"
"i wish i was in the southland sitting in a chair
with one arm around my old guitar
and the other one around my dear
i'm rolling on i'm rolling on i'm rolling on through life just rolling on
sitting in the moonlight blue as blue can be
strumming on my old guitar
to give my poor heart ease
whether i'm in the country whether i'm in the town
my old guitar is near me
whether i'm up or down
maybe i will marry if i can find a girl
but i'll always love my guitar
as much as i love her"
"i'm waiting at the gate looking for my ride
soon to take me to my home on high
angel bands a coming from the other side
i don't want to be late i'm waiting at the gate
i can hear the thunder the time's at hand
joybells are ringing in the promised land
jesus is a coming my soul to take
yes my lord sees me waiting at the gate
i'm a' leaving the world no more to do
all of my work on earth is through
i've fought the fight i've kept the faith
well i'm ready to go i'm waiting at the gate"
"i'm beggin' to you and i want to go with you
you're breakin' my heart as you say goodbye
i hope and i pray we'll soon be together
my heart is so full it's hard not to cry
what will i do when the leaves start fallin'
the far distant hill will make me feel blue
soon the flowers will die don't let love die with them
and with you gone dear what will i do
your sweet ruby lips and hair like an angel
and your mournful eyes they keep haunting me
but to know that you're mine it makes life worth livin'
oh the times gone by are sweet memories
i'm trusting in you but each hour seems longer
i'm counting the days when i'll be with you
our hearts are entwined they're blessed with the future
a safe journey home i'm waiting for you"
"high on that lonesome road to heaven's blessed abode
for many years i was burdened with care
so often lightening flashed and raging billows dashed
my sorrow then was so heavy to bear
but since my jesus came i praise his holy name
he sheds the light of his wonderful grace
and every night and day to him i steal away
i found a blessed hiding place
i found a hiding place a blessed hiding place
i said a hiding a blessed hiding place
there's glory in my soul my hallelujah rolls
but since my jesus came i'm under his control
he keeps me night and day he answers when i pray
and from the raging storm to him i steal away
i hear those temptors knock i feel no temply shock
oh in the solid rock i found a hinding place
just like a wandering jew that had no place to choose
each day i had to keep travelin' on
but now i've found the way that leads to endless days
no more in darkness i wander alone
when satan would alarm i climb in god's strong arm
and hide away in his loving embrace
for in the solid rock the blessed solid rock
i found a blessed hidin' place"
"the longest train i ever saw
went down that georgia line
the engine passed at six o'clock
and the cab passed by at nine
in the pines, in the pines
where the sun never shines
and we shiver when the cold wind blows
i asked my captain for the time of day
he said he throwed his watch away
a long steel rail and a short cross tie
i'm on my way back home
little girl, little girl, what have i done
that makes you treat me so
you caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn
you caused me to leave my home
my father was an engineer
died a mile out of town
his head was found in the driving gear
but his body was never found"
"it's mighty dark for me to travel
for my sweetheart she is gone
the road is rough and filled with gravel
but i must journey on and on
to me she was a little angel
sent down to me from god above
and on the day that i first met her
then i told her of my love
many a night we strolled together
talking of our love so fair
my love for her will never vanish
oh i know i'll meet her there
traveling down this lonesome highway
thinking of my love who's gone
knowing soon we'll be together
she's the only love i've known"
"i sell the morning paper, sir, my name is jimmy brown
everybody knows that i'm the newsboy of the town
you can hear me yelling ""morning star"", as i run along the street
i've got no hat upon my head, no shoes upon my feet
i sell the morning paper, sir, my name is jimmy brown
everybody knows that i'm the newsboy of the town
never mind, sir, how i look, don't look at me and frown
i sell the morning paper, sir, my name is jimmy brown
i'm awful cold and hungry, sir, my clothes are mighty thin
i wander 'bout from place to place, my daily bread to win
i sell the morning paper, sir, my name is jimmy brown
everybody knows that i'm the newsboy of the town
my father was a drunkard, sir, i've heard my mother say
and i am helping my mother, sir, as i journey on my way
my mother always tells me, sir, i've nothing in the world to lose
i'll get a place in heaven, sir, selling the ""gospel news""
i sell the morning paper, sir, my name is jimmy brown
everybody knows that i'm the newsboy of the town"
"i once was lost in sin but jesus took me in
and then a little light from heaven filled my soul
it bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
and just a little talk with jesus made me whole
now let us have a little talk with jesus
let us tell him all about our troubles
he will hear our famished cry
he will answer by and by
now when you feel a little prayer turning
and you know the little talk with jesus makes it right
sometimes my path seems dreary without a ray of cheer
and then the cloud about me hides the light of day
the mists in me rise and hide the stormy skies
but just a little talk with jesus clears the way
i may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
but jesus is a friend who watches day and and night
i go to him in prayer he knows my every care
and just a little talk with jesus makes it right
you will find a little talk with jesus makes it right
makes everything right"
"we were waltzing that night in kentucky
'neath the beautiful harvest moon
and i was the boy who was lucky
but it all ended too soon
as i sit here alone in the moonlight
i can see your smiling face
and i long once more for your embrace
in that beautiful kentucky waltz"
"let me rest at the end of my journey
i'm weary, tired, and old
let me rest at the end of my journey
heaven is my home and my goal
old paint is tired, his feet are all sore
we'll ride the range no more
let me rest at the end of my journey
heaven is my home and my goal
a cowboy's life on the old texas trail
herding doggies is all that he knows
a cowboy's life on the old cattle trail
leads from texas to old mexico"
"i can't answer her letter
for she left me no address
you should know my little darling
you left my poor heart in distress
i got a letter from my darling
she said she hated to go
it broke my heart the words she wrote me
she closed by saying i love you so
she wrote the words she knew would hurt me
she said i never could be true
i've tried i've tried my little darling
to prove my love was just for you
this letter meant goodbye forever
though we'll have each other's hearts
our love will fade away in sadness
precious one why did we have to part"
"tonight i'm alone without you my dear
it seems there's a longing for you still
all i have to do now is sit alone and cry
in our little cabin home on the hill
oh, someone has taken you from me
and left me here all alone
just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
in our little cabin home on the hill
i hope you are happy tonight as you are
but in my heart there's a longing for you still
i just keep it there so i won't be alone
in our little cabin home on the hill
now when you have come to the end of the way
and find there's no more happiness for you
just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
to our little cabin home on the hill"
"now come and listen to my story
a story that i know is true
a little rose that bloomed in georgia
with hair of gold and a heart so true
way down in the blue ridge mountains
way down where the tall pines grow
lives my sweetheart of the mountains
she's my little georgia rose
her mother left her with another
a carefree life she had planned
the baby now she is a lady
the one her mother couldn't stand
we often sing those songs together
i watched her do her little part
she smiled at me when i would tell her
that she was my sweetheart"
"our darling wandered far away while she was out at play
lost in the woods she couldn't hear a sound
she was our darling girl the sweetest thing in all the world
we searched for her but she couldn't be found
i heard the screams of out little girl far away
hurry daddy there's and awful dreadful snake
i ran as fast as i could through the dark and dreary woods
but i reached our darling girl too late
oh i began to cry i knew that soon she'd have to die
for the snake was warning me close by
i held her close to my face she said daddy kill that snake
it's getting dark tell mommy goodbye
to all parents i must say don't let your children stray away
they need your love to guide them along
oh god i pray we'll see our darling girl some day
it seems we still can hear her voice around our home"
"oh i'm gettin' old and feeble and i cannot work no more
the children no more gather 'round my door
and old masters and old mrs they are sleepin' side by side
near the little old log cabin in the lane
oh the chimney's fallen down and the roof's all caved in
lettin' in the sunshine and the rain
and the only friend i've got now is that good old dag of mine
and the little old log cabin in the lane
oh the trees have all growed up that lead around the hill
the fences have all gone to decay
and the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
and things have changed their course another way
oh i ain't got long to stay here what little time i've got
i want to rest content wile i remain
'til death shall call this dog and me to find a better home
and a little old log cabin in the lane"
"i was lost in sin so long with no one to guide my way
my soul was in darkness had been for many a day
in that little community church house i heard that gospel song
i went inside to kneel and pray
oh i kneeled down and prayed to my savior
that he might hear and would accept me
and then i felt the holy spirit
i knew my soul was saved in me
in that little community church house that's where we sang and prayed
we prayed to our father to guide us on our way
all through life's long journey we'll need his helping hand
until we reach that promised land
in that little community church house among my many friends
i can hear them praying for me and the preacher said amen
and the vision there before me it was my savior's face
i knew that i was saved by grace"
"they tell me that you are going away
what makes you want to leave?
you gave me your love and you gave me your vow
now you're leavin' me here to grieve
live and let live, don't break my heart
don't leave me here to cry
i never could live if we should part
tell me you don't mean goodbye
stayed awake last night and i walked the floor
what makes you treat me so?
live and let live, don't break my heart
i don't want to live if you go
you're the one who's made me love you so
you're the one who's makin' me cry
you're the one who'd break my heart if you go
tell me you don't mean goodbye"
"i leave pittsburgh with a load of steel
nobody knows just how i feel
with the road up ahead and my baby behind
keep me drivin' with a worried mind
lonesome truck driver blues
lonesome truck driver blues
with the road up ahead and my baby behind
keep me drivin' with a worried mind
lonesome truck driver blues
if you load too light you can't make a dime
if you load to heavy then you get a fine
look at 'em lined up down the road
guess i'd better dump my load
well it's coffee cakes and pork and beans
black eyed peas and turnip greens
turn on my radio one time more
hear ernest tubb a walkin' the floor
oh the motor's purrin' i'm makin' time
takin' me back to that baby of mine
she'll be purrin' like a kitten when i walk in the door
the truck driver blues i won't sing anymore"
"many years i've been lookin' for a place to call home
but i still didn't find it so i must travel on
i don't care for the fine mansions on earth's sinkin sand
lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
lord build me just a cabin in the corner of gloryland
in the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
where i can hear the angels and shake jesus' hand
lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
listen lord i'm not askin' to live in the midst
for i know that i'm not worthy of such splendor as this
when i ask him for mercy while humbly i stand
lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
i've many dear loved one's who've gone on this way
on the grapevine of mournin' shall i hear them all say
come and join in the singin' and play in our band
lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland"
"long john walkin' around in the rain
he's long gone lost john
long gone lost john
no hat on his head no shoes on his feet

like a rabbit through bowlin' green
lost john walked around in rain
around the corner left him sittin' by the ol' railroad"
"as you read this letter that i write to you
sweetheart i hope you understand
that you're the only love i knew
please forgive me if you can
sweetheart i beg you to come home tonight
i'm so blue and all alone

love, oh love oh please come home
that old wind is cold and slowly creeping 'round
and the fire is burning low
the snow has covered up the ground
your baby's hungry sick and cold"
"there's folks building homes as sweet as can be
they're levelling their yards and planting their trees
but my little hut i'll just let it be
lord jesus is building a mansion for me
a mansion for me a mansion for me built by my lord beyond calvary
but my little hut i'll just let it be
lord jesus is building a mansion for me
each day i am getting more ready to go
he's cleansing my sins more whiter than snow
i'm packing my troubles i'm bound with his love
get ready to move to heaven above
to you who have homes in this world below
driving fine cars wherever you go
there's coming a time when we'll all pass away
get ready to move with me on that day"
"mother left this world of sorrow
our home was silent and so sad
dad took sick and had to leave us
i have no home no mother nor dad
there's a little lonesome grave yard
on these tomestones it did say
on mother's ""gone but not forgotten""
on dad's ""we'll meet again someday""
i often go out to the graveyard
where they laided them down to rest
i can almost hear them whisper
trust in god he'll do the rest
their souls have gone up to heaven
where they'll dwell with god above
where they'll meet there friends and loved ones
and share with all his precious love"
"t'was midnight on the stormy deep
my solitary watch i'd keep
and think of her i'd left behind
and ask if she'd be true and kind
i never shall forget the day
that i was forced to go away
in silence there my head she'd rest
and held me to her loving breast
oh willy don't go back to sea
there's other girls as good as me
but none can love you true as i
pray don't go where the bullets fly
the deep deep sea may us divide
and i may be some other's bride
but still my thoughts will oft times stray
to be with thou so far away
i never have proved false to thee
the love i gave was true and kind
but you have proved untrue to me
i can no longer call thee mine
so fare thee well i'd rather make
my home upon some icy lake
where the southern sun refused to shine
then to trust a love so false as thine"
"it's mighty dark for me to travel
for my sweetheart she is gone
the road is rough and filled with gravel
but i must journey on and on.
to me she was a little angel
sent down to me from god above
t'was on the day that i first met her
that i told her of her love.
many a night we'd stroll together
talking of our love so fair
my love for her will never vanish
for i know i'll meet her there.
traveling down this lonesome highway
thinking of my love that's gone
knowing soon we'll be together
she's the only love i've known."

"she bloomed for me near a little village
in a cabin on the hill
we made our vows we'd love each other
and i know we always will
she's my rose of old kentucky
i watched her bloom as the years roll by
and to me there'll never be another
i'll love her 'til the day i die
oh in dreams i see my darling
in a gingham dress she looks so sweet
oh i long for old kentucky
and my darling was more to me
oh i know you often wonder
so i'll tell you the reason why
she's my rose of old kentucky
and i know she'll never lie"
"the stars up in the sky remind me of your eyes
and the way they use to gaze into mine
the moon up above brings back memories of love
i thought was true and so divine
so never again, oh never no more
never again will i knock upon your door
never again but these words i can say
i'll try not to love and stay out of your way
we had the greatest start but deep within your heart
you led me on before i knew the score
you cheated and you lied i stayed right by your side
until one day simply closed the door"
"i'll never love no one else but my darlin'
even though we both had to part
i'll never love no one else but my darlin'
where ever she goes she'll always have my heart
as most people say absence makes the heart grow cold
but the kind of love we had each other's heart will hold
i'll never love no one else but my darlin'
as we travel down two different lonesome roads
i'll never let no one take your place my darlin'
for you know you meant the world to me
i'll never let no one tale your place my darlin'
for your love won't let my heart be free"
"nobody loves me nobody cares
if life is empty and full of tears
i long for new love searched everywhere
nobody loves me nobody cares
searchin' for true love has been in vain
through years my heart has suffered with pain
life's lonesome burden now i must bear
nobody loves me nobody cares
nights on my pillow i dream of you
through space i gaze at the stars above
they seem to whisper from way up there
nobody loves me nobody cares
a lonesome heart and a troubled mind
in this old world now is all i find
i look to heaven for i know there
someone will love me someone will care"
"oh my brother take this warning
don't let ol satan take your hand
you'll be lost in sin forever
you'll never reach the promised land
the old crossroads now is waiting
which one are you going to take
one leads down to destruction
the other to the pearly gate
one road leads up to heaven
the other goes down below
jesus our savior will protect you
he'll guide you through the old crossroads
soon your life will be over
you'll have to face the old crossroads
will you be ready then my brother
to shun the one down below"
"there's an old, old house that once was a mansion
on a hill overlooking the town
but time has left a wreckage where once there was beauty
and soon the old house will tumble down
but when the leaves start to fall in autumn
and the raindrops drip from the trees
there's an old old man who walks in the garden
and his head is bowed in memories
they say he built the mansion for the love of a woman
they planned to be married in the fall
but her love for him faded in the last days of summer
and the house stands empty after all"
"traveling down this long lonesome highway
i'm so lonesome i could cry
memories of how we once loved each other
and now we are saying good bye.
on and on i'll follow my darling
and i wonder where she can be
on and on i'll follow my darling
and i wonder if she ever thinks of me.
i've cried i've cried for you little darling
it breaks my heart to hear your name
my friends they also love you my darling
and they think that i am to blame.
i have to follow you my darling
i can't sleep when the sun goes down
by your side is my destination
the road is clear and that's where i'm bound."
"i walked out to the graveyard
down by the church of god
i looked upon the one i love
that would soon be covered with sod
up along the ohio river
over on the old kentucky shore
once dwelled a fair young maiden
now there's a crepe upon her door
the angels took my darling
god needed the one i loved
i reached the old kentucky shore today
i'll make my plans and meet her up above
the last words that my darling said
was tell the one i love goodbye
i would like to see him before i go
but i'll meet him in the sky"
"out in the cold world and far away from home
some mother's boy is wanderin' all alone.
no one to guide him or keep his footsteps right
some mother's boy is homeless tonight.
bring back to me my wandering boy
for there is no other who's left to give me joy
tell him that his mother with faded cheeks and hair
is at the old home place awaiting him there
out in the hallway then stands a vacant chair
and an old pair of shoes he used to wear
empty is the cradle he used to love so well
oh how i miss him no tongue can tell.
well i rememeber those parting words he said
well meet up yonder where tears are never shed
in that land of sunshine, away from toil and care
when life is over, i'll meet you up there"
"i got a pig at home in a pen
corn to feed him on
all i need's a pretty little girl
to feed i'm when i'm gone
going up on a mountain
to sow a little cane
raise a barrel of sorghum
sweet little liza jane
black clouds arising
sure sign of rain
put that old gray bonnet
on little liza jane
yonder comes that gal of mine
how do you think i know
know her by that gingham gown
hanging down so low
bake them biscuits baby
bake em good and brown
when you get them biscuits baked
we're alabama bound"
"plant some flowers by my graveside
just a little bunch of them
makes no difference what they are, dear
since your hand has planted them
darlin', when you pass the graveside
you see my name there on a slab
won't you stop a little while dear
for i would be lonesome there
you will do this won't you darlin'
you will do this last request
you will do this won't you darlin'
when they lay me down to rest"
"as i travel down life's pathway
knowing not what the years may hold
as i ponder hopes grow fonder
precious memories flood my soul
precious memories how they linger
how they ever flood my soul
in the stillness of the midnight
precious sacred scenes unfold
precious father loving mother
fly across the lonely years
and old home scenes from my childhood
in fond memory appear"
"now, come and bathe my forehead, mother
for i'm growing very weak
let one drop of water, mother,
fall upon my burning cheek
go and tell my little playmates
that i never more will play
give them all my toys, but mother,
put my little shoes away
you will do this won't you mother?
please remember what i say
give them all my toys, but mother,
put my little shoes away
santa claus he brought them to me
with a lot of other things
and i thought he brought an angel
with a pair of golden wings
soon the baby will be larger
and they'll fit his little feet
won't he look so nice and funny
as he walks upon the street
you will do this won't you mother?
please remember what i say
give them all my toys, but mother,
put my little shoes away"
"do you think of the cross on which jesus died
of the blood he shed for you
are you prepared to meet him in that land of love
by his word are you going to abide
remember the cross on which jesus died
follow in his footsteps each day
he shed his blood for you and he shed his blood for me
never cast that cross aside
never let other people lead you astray
teach his words to them if you can
they must think of that cross on which jesus died
and get ready to meet him someday
when jesus comes down from heaven above
and you haven't thought of that cross
he'll cast you aside in the twinkling of an eye
and you won't see his blessed home of love"
"oh the river of death lies just before me
can i find a place that i can cross
or will i be in sin forever
oh lord don't let my soul be lost
oh i wanna walk with christ my savior
for he's the one that'll guide me on
all through my life i've been a sinner
now i'm right with god so i'm travelling home
oh i can hear my savior calling
to me his voice sounds sweet and low
for me i hear my loved ones cheering
oh, praise the lord i'm ready to go
my life down here will soon be over
and this old world holds nothing for me
he saved my soul and he made me happy
that beautiful land i'm going to see"
"in the beautiful hills in the mists of roane county
there's where i have roamed for many long years
there's where my heart's been tendin most ever
there's where the first step of misfortune i made
it's about thirty years when i courted and married
armanda gilbraith i'd soon call my wife
my brother he stabbed me for some unknown reason
just three month's later i'd taken tom's life
i was captured and tried in the village of kingston
not a man in that county would speak one kind word
when the jury came in with the verdict next mornin'
a lifetime in prison was the words that i heard
when the train pulled out poor mother stood weepin'
and sister she sat all alone with a sigh
and the last words i heard was ""willy god bless you""
was ""willy god bless you god bless you goodbye""
in the scorching hot sand of the foundry i'm workin'
toiling and working my poor life away
they'll measure my grave on the banks of old cumberland
just as soon as i finish the rest of my days
poort martha was grave, but corey was better
there's better and worse, although you may see
boys when you write home from this prison in nashville
place one of my songs in your letter for me"
"now the road is rocky, but it won't be rocky long
now the road is rocky, but it won't be rocky long
another man has got my woman and gone
i've got those blues, i'm wearing out the soles of my shoes
i've got those blues, i'm wearing out the soles of my shoes
my gal went away and left me she left me with the dog gone blues
you'll never miss your water til the well runs dry
you'll never miss your water til the well runs dry
you'll never miss your woman until she says goodbye
i wish to the lord you'd bring my woman back home
i wish to the lord you'd bring my woman back home
i'm not so lonesome, just don't want to be alone"

in a cabin on the hill

i'll love her 'til the day i die.
in my dreams i see my darling
in a gingham dress she looks so sweet
how i long for old kentucky
for my darling i will meet.

and i'll tell you the reason why
she's my rose of old kentucky
and i know that she will never lie"
"dear sweetheart as i write to you my heart is filled with pain
for if those things i hear are true i'll never see you again
they tell me darlin' that tonight you'll wed another man
but if you do i'll tell you true my boat will never land
you promised that you would wait for me that nothin' could come between
that in my arms someday you'd be my wife and lovely queen
i built you that cozy home and made a garden there
and planted too with my own hands sweet flowers rich and fair
my future hopes are placed in you you've been my guidin' star
please write and tell me that you're true to the sailor who waits afar
just tell me that you love me yet still long to be my wife
i'll return and then we'll wed and live a happy life"

my poor old heart is breaking
since my sweet love ain't around.
lord i think i start to ramble

my good gal left me lord she went away
and now she's gone but i don't worry

ashes to ashes, dust to dust
show me a woman a man can trust
mississippi river, long, deep and wide
the woman i'm loving is on the other side
you don't like my peaches, don't you shake my tree
get out of my orchard, let my peaches be
don't you come here running, holding out your hand
i'll get me a woman like you got your man"

itâ€™s been that way, since from the start
go on your way, you have another waiting
stay away from me, youâ€™re breaking my heart
oh the sky is blue, and the sun is shinning
and autumn leaves have turned to brown
i loved you so, but i canâ€™t have you
stay away from me, stay out of town
stay away from me, i know what youâ€™re after
its best if we, stay far apart
you brought me pain, no joy no laughter
stay away from me, youâ€™re breaking my heart"
"sugar coated love, you gave me on a plate
i took a bite and then i looked to see what i had ate
i found i had a cinder all covered up in white
that old sugar coated love is something i can't bite
you say you are leaving me for another man
he has all the wealth and charm and not my kind of brand
baby i fell down on my knees a pleading for your love
can't understand what i saw in a sugar coated love
you called me your sugar plum, your baby and your pet
said i was your romeo and you my juliet
i thought you were my angel, my little sugar dove
you sure had me fooled, babe, with that sugar coated love"

sweetheart, i thought the world of you
but now you left me all alone
i have no one to call my own

you have left me all alone

sweetheart, when you will change your mind
i never shall forget the day
when you said you were going away
i couldn't believe that it was true
after all the love i had for you
this road is rough and rocky too
as i travel on, dear, without you
but i'm still praying for the time
sweetheart when you will change your mind"
"once in my youth, i stood on this mountain
and planted some pines in the sand
every day i looked their way
but just couldn't understand
why they never grew like i thought they should do
i just couldn't understand why
now i've rambled around this wide world through
and today i just happened by
tall pines, tall pines
reaching up for the clouds
tall pines, tall pines
i bet you wouldn't know me now.
i'll never forget the morning i left
the hum of the bees in the hay
the farther i walk, the harder they talk
how silent it seems here today
there's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch
surrounding the old family graves
and there's one gravestone standing all alone
there waiting to join me in the shade
tall pines, tall pines
reaching up for the clouds
tall pines, tall pines
i've come home to sleep beneath your boughs."
"oh the home above  so far away that's where we pray  we'll live someday in the home above  beyond the starlight sky where the soul of man  will never die 
i'm ready to leave  this world below to the home above  i'm ready to go then mother will say  welcome home our son in a heavenly home  our life has just begun 
oh my mother and dad  have gone on before they're waiting for me  on the heavenly shore i long to see  and shake their hand when i'm safe at home  as they had planned 
oh the beautiful land  where we'll never die that's where my soul  shall rest on high i'll sing and shout  for his face i'll see with god i'll rest  for eternity "
"i can hear the voice of the boatman comin'
and i'll be ready when he calls my name
so happy i'll be on my way to heaven
i hear the angels freely say
oh the boat of love down at the harbor
it's waiting there for you and me
i have no fear christ is the captain
he'll guide us o'r life's rollin' sea
let's get on board that great excursion
and sail the sea to the home above
don't wait too late to make your reservation
it's the boat of god's eternal love
oh the boat of love will soon be sailing
it's headin' for that golden shore
don't wait too late to make your reservation
heaven is my home for evermore"
"springtime is near my darling
you say that you are going away
my heart will be with you my darling
and iã‚â€™m counting now the days
i know that soon iã‚â€™ll have to travel
i know iã‚â€™m over the hill
i feel so all alone my darling said sheã‚â€™d be gone
when i heard that first whippoorwill
the flowers are blooming little darling
with the budding of the trees
i hear the night birds a crying
i know that they are warning me
our love was planted little darling
just like the farmer plants his grain
but there will never be a harvest
on the hills the whippoorwills now sing"
"let me tell you a tale about a spry old man
guess he's as old as the hills
he's the favorite fiddler for miles and miles around
and plays for all the good quadrilles
every saturday night all the folks stop in and tune
the whole town is ready to go
while the fellers chose their partners and the caller taps the jug
and the old man puts the rosen to the bow
you could hear uncle ben yellin' do si do
swing that gal in the calico"
"i donâ€™t know i donâ€™t know where iâ€™ll go or what iâ€™ll do
it makes no difference what iâ€™ll do without you
oh i love you my darling but iâ€™ll try and let you be
goodbye, itâ€™s the last youâ€™ll hear of me
well i found a bluebird high on a mountain side
and the bluebird would sing itã‚â€™s little song
so iâ€™ll sigh, iâ€™ll cry, iâ€™ll even want to die
for the one i love is gone"
"now as i sigh the hours away
i think of love of yesterday
now i know she's gone away
she's in heaven so they say
will the angels tell her for me
that my love will never die
someday i'll walk along beside her
on that golden way up there
now all my life i lived so gaily
until she had to go away
then she left me oh so lonely
she lies at rest beneath the clay
each night i think about you dear
i wonder if you'll hold me then
when i meet you up in heaven
we'll have life eternal there"
"in dreams of you my body trembles
i wake up and call your name
but you're not there and i'm so lonely
without your love i'll go insane
those memories of you still haunt me
every night when i lay down
i'll always love you little darling
until the day they lay me down
i close my eyes and you're there with me
your kiss i feel your face i see
it's not your lips now that drive me crazy
it's just your haunting memory"
"i'm traveling down this lonesome road oh how i hate to go
the wind and storms are raging high and it's awful cold
my mind drifts back to you sweetheart and i love you so
now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
i remember dear not long ago you said you'd be my own
i never thought you'd go away and leave me all alone
the kind of love you had for me i find sweetheart grows cold
for now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
all i do is roam around and look for you my dear
i know i'll search ten thousand miles oh how i need you here
you broke my heart you left me here now i'm growing old
why did you go and leave me here to travel this lonesome road"
"oh i was lost in the darkness and i wandered astray
with no one to help me along on my way
until i heard jesus calling saying come unto me
and i'm traveling on and on
oh lord i'm traveling on by the help of my savior
i can never more stray for jesus leads the way
and my heaven lies awaiting at the end of my journey oh lord i'm traveling on and on
oh i can hear jesus calling and his voice sounds so sweet
and i knew that the time would come to me that he'd speak
but these trials are over for he bid me come home
now i'm traveling on and on
oh the lord is my savior i will walk with him each day
he will help and protect me to the end of the way
my journey soon will be over and i'll join a happy band
now i'm traveling on and on"
"i hate to see the sun sink low
just for a cause you ought to know
for it's true love i can't forget
all of my sorrow you'll soon regret
you promised me love that was true
and i'm sorry to say that i believed in you
it's all turned out just like a dream
left me so sad in the world it seems
there's dishes to wash and a house to clean
there's washing to do, oh it seems so mean
there's a million words i can't explain
think of this girl, before you change your name
they'll go away and leave you at home
they never care if you're alone
they seem to forget they've got a wife
this story is sad, but it's a true life"
"oh the people would come from far away
they'd dance all night till the break of day
when the caller hollered ""do se do""
you knew uncle pen was ready to go
late in the evening about sundown
high on the hill and above the town
uncle pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
you could hear it talk, you could hear it sing
he played an old piece he called ""soldier's joy""
and the one called ""the boston boy""
the greatest of all was ""jenny lynn""
to me that's where the fiddle begins
i'll never forget that mournful day
when uncle pen was called away
they hung up his fiddle, they hung up his bow
they knew it was time for him to go"
"well you don't love me anymore my darling
i'm just a used to be to you
those cold cold kisses that you gave me little darling
proved to me you found somebody new
tomorrow's just another lonesome day
and i know you'll want me far away
well you don't love me anymore my darling
i'm just a used to be to you
gone are the good old days that we spent together
and i don't know if i can stand the pain
of knowing that you'll soon be gone forever
and i'll never know your love again"
"the wind is blowing cross the mountains
and out on the valley way below.
it sweeps the grave of my darling
when i die that's where i want to go.
lord send the angels for my darling
and take her to that home on high
i'll wait my time out here on earth love
and come to you when i die.
our names are carved upon the tombstone
i promised you before you died
our love will bloom forever darling
when we rest side by side.
i hear a voice out in the darkness
it moans and whispers through the pines
i know it's my sweetheart a calling
i hear her through the walls of time"
"darling you often said you loved me
but you've gone on before
you don't know dear how i miss you
but we can't be darlings anymore
darling i am sad and lonely
since you've gone on before
so down here on this lonely earth dear
we can't be darlings anymore
until we meet up there in heaven
and we can walk the golden shore
for down here on this lonely earth dear
we can't be darlings anymore
i have lost a million tears dear
since you've left this world and gone
but we can never again be darlings
till we meet around the throne"
"i left the one that love in the mountains
and all the love we shared
but each night as she kneels by her bed side
i know she calls my name in her prayer
when the moon shines on the blue ridge mountains
and it seems i can hear my sweetheart call
how i long to be near to my darling
when the golden leaves begin to fall
she knows that i'll return to the mountains
and will bring to her a wedding ring
it will be placed upon her finger
happiness to us both it will bring
winter time is so cold in the mountains
the ground will soon be covered white with snow
how i long to keep the home fires burning
for i know my darling needs me so"
"mckinley hollered , mckinley squalled
doc said ã‚â€œmckinley i can't find the cause
you're bound to die, you're bound to die
doc told the horse, he'd throw down his rein
he said to the horse you gotta outrun this train
from buffalo to washington
the doc came a running, he took off his specs
said ã‚â€œmr mckinley better cash in your checks
you've bound to die, you're bound to die
look here, you rascal, you see what you've done
shot down my husband and i've got your gun
i'm carrying you back, to washington
well, roosevelt's in the white house, doing his best
mckinley's in the graveyard taking his rest
he's gone, for a long time"
"oh, why oh why did you wander
why did you ever roam
when you know that we always were happy
all alone in our old mountain home
it was down in the old cumberland mountains
down in the hills of tennessee
as she waited alone in the moonlight
it was there that she waited for me
oh why did you leave me little darling
why did you leave me alone
for you knew i'd be lonely without you
all alone in our old mountain home
i hope you will always be happy
no matter where you may roam
and i long to be with you up in heaven
as we were in our old mountain home"
"in this awful world of sorrow
on this wicked path of sin
never thinking of tomorrow
or what i'd lose in the end
oh i can hear  the joy bells ringing
where my friends  and loved ones wait
oh i can hear the angels singing just inside  those pearly gates
i can hear my savior calling
saying come unto me
wash away your sins forever
and you shall rest eternally
now i'm safe with my jesus
he will guide me on my way
i will sing his praise forever
we'll meet in heaven some sweet day"
"now will you love me little darling
when i'm in some other land?
and you know i can't be with you
or will you be loving another man?
will you be loving another man
will you be loving another man
when i return will you be waiting
or will you be loving another man
now don't be crying on my shoulder
and telling me that love is grand
and before i'm out of sight dear
then be loving another man
now if i find this to be true dear
i want you to please understand
when i return don't say you're sorry
just keep on loving another man"
"all your life you've lived a sinner the bright way you've never trod
you're drifting away you're drifting away
when you come to cross the river and you haven't met with god
you're drifting away you're drifting away
you're drifting away you're drifting away
on down the dark river i'm sorry to say
you're drifting away you're drifting away
don't wait too long to let jesus hear you pray
you won't give up your earthly treasures to enter the promised land
you're drifting away you're drifting away
you can hear jesus callin' and you won't accept his hand
you're drifting away you're drifting away
when you come to the river jesus don't give thee command
you're drifting away you're drifting away
and the dark rollin' river takes you to the sinkin' sand
you're drifting away you're drifting away"
