"my world is like a river
as dark as it is deep
night after night
the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
my days are just and endless stream
of emptiness to me
filled only by
the fleeting moments of her memories
sweet memories
sweet memories
she slipped into the silence
of my dreams last night
wandering from room to room
she's turning on each light
her laughter spills like river
from the water to the sea
and i'm swept away from sadness
clinging to her memories"
"georgia, georgia,
the whole day through
just an old sweet song
keeps georgia on my mind
i said oh georgia
georgia
a song of you
comes as sweet and clear
as moonlight through the pines
other arms reach out to me
other eyes smile tenderly
still in peaceful dreams i see
the road leads back to you
i said georgia,
ooh georgia, no peace i find
just an old sweet song
keeps georgia on my mind
other arms reach out to me
other eyes smile tenderly
still in peaceful dreams i see
the road leads back to you

just this old, sweet song

it's no secret, you'll feel better, if you cry
when wakened, from a bad dream, don't you sometimes think it's real
well it's only, false emotion, that you feel
if your heartaches, seems to hang around, too long
and your blues, keep getting blue er, with each song
remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
so let your hair down now, and baby go on and cry
well remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
why don't you let your hair down now, baby go on and cry

she's everything on earth to me.

your looks are laughable, un photographable,

is your mouth a little weak?

"if you go away on this summer day,
then you might as well take the sun away;
all the birds that flew in the summer sky,
when our love was new and our hearts were high;
when the day was young and the night was long,
and the moon stood still for the night bird's song.
if you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
if you go, as i know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning
till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love
without loving you,
can i tell you now, as you turn to go, i'll be dying slowly till the next hello,
if you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
but if you stay, i'll make you a night
like no night has been, or will be again.
i'll sail on your smile, i'll ride on your touch,
i'll talk to your eyes that i love such.
but if you go, go, i won't cry,
though the good is gone from the word goodbye,
if you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
if you go away, as i know you must,
there'll be nothing left in the world to trust,
just an empty room, full of empty space,
like the empty look i see on your face.
i'd have been the shadow of your dog
if i thought it might have kept me by your side.
if you go away, if you go away, if you go away."

all my dreams, turned to ashes and gall,

i have nothing at all
once i had, whoa a sweetheart
who loved only me
there was nothing, that she would not give,
but i was blind to her goodness and i could not see
that a heart without love cannot live
whoa, without love i have nothing,
whoa, without love, friends i have nothing, at all
ohhh, i have conquered, yeah the world
oh hooo, tell me what did i have?
without love, ohh, i have nothing now, at all"

or if it's dark or fair
somehow, that's just the way it is
and i don't really care
i go to this or that place
i seem alive and well
my head is just a hat place
my breast an empty shell
and i've a faded dream to sell
all alone, all at sea
why does nobody care for me?
when there's no love to hold my love
why is my heart so frail?
like a ship without a sail.
out on the ocean,
sailors can use a chart
i'm on the ocean
guided by just a lonely heart
still alone, still at sea
still there's no one to care for me
when there's no hand to hold my hand
life is a loveless tale
for a ship without a sail
still alone, still at sea
still there's no one to care for me
when there's no hand to hold my hand

lets its windows down,
little slaves are free at night;

till the crowds are out of sight.
there's a rendezvous for lovers,
where we two can play,
very near your door,
in the city's core,
but it seems a millions miles away.
meet me underneath our little tree in the park!
no one else around, but you and me in the dark!
just five minutes from your door step,
i'll wait for your step to come along!
and the city's roar becomes a song!
while i'm waiting, i discover more in your charms;
suddenly i turn around, and your in my arms.
and if there's a moon above you,
i'll carve ""i love you,"" upon the bark,
underneath our little tree, inside the park!
we'll make ev'ry bough
shake, and wonder how
two could be so nearly one.
ev'ry blade of grass
sadly sighs, ""alas!""
grass can never have such fun.
in the desert town's oasis,
we'll love ' neath the tree;
it can't be a miss
if the birdies kiss;
we're as good as birds, aren't we?"

we´ve no less days to sing god's praise
then when we first begun!"
"oh beautiful, for heroes proved,
in liberating strife,
who more than self, our country loved,
and mercy more than life,
america, america, may god thy gold refine,
till all success be nobleness
and every gain devined.
and you know when i was in school,
we used to sing it something like this, listen here:
oh beautiful, for spacious skies,
for amber waves of grain,
for purple mountain majesties,
above the fruited plain,
but now wait a minute, i'm talking about
america, sweet america,
you know, god done shed his grace on thee,
he crowned thy good, yes he did, in a brotherhood,
from sea to shining sea.
you know, i wish i had somebody to help me sing this
america, i love you america, you see,
my god he done shed his grace on thee,
and you oughta love him for it,
cause he, he, he, he, crowned thy good,
he told me he would, with brotherhood,
.
oh lord, oh lord, i thank you lord"
"we meet, and the angels sing.
the angels sing the sweetest song i ever heard.
you speak, and the angels sing.
or am i breathing music into every word?
suddenly, the setting is strange.
i can see water and moonlight beaming.
silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore
suddenly, i see it all change.
long winter nights with the candles gleaming.
through it all your face that i adore.
you smile, and the angels sing.
and though it's just a gentle murmur at the start.
we kiss, and the angels sing.
and leave their music ringing in my heart!"
"angelina, why did you have to go
it's hard enough alone, well you should know
the scars you never showed me
your eyes that turned away
angelina, to god for you i prayed
angelina, i often heard you weep
at times i'd stay awake and watch you sleep
your innocence would move me
at times you've made me scared
angelina, my love for you i cared
angelina, in silence you would speak
a simple touch of you and i grew weak
you finally let me hold you
the day before you died
angelina, my angel in the sky
you finally let me hold you
the day before you died
angelina, my angel in the sky"
"well, i just stopped in this evening
to get myself a little taste
the music is nice and swinging
and of course, i really dig the place
course, i haven't
had much sleep lately
i feel sorta down and out
yeah, but look over there
in the corner, man
oh, yeah, there's something
to shout about
hey, hey, pretty baby
girl, don't you go nowhere
i'm talking to you, pretty baby
girl, don't you go nowhere
cause as soon as i pay the bartender
girl, i'll be right there
she looked up and blushed and smiled
and my heart skipped a beat
mmm, she's stacked from
her head down to her feet
hey, barkeep
you better come here and get your bread
this little girl's getting ready to split
and i'm about to go out of my head
hey, hey, pretty baby
girl, don't you go out that door
i'm talking to you, pretty baby
girl, don't you go out that door
i'm afraid if i lose sight of you
i just might not see you no more
she slowed up just a little bit
and turned her head and smiled
she was 34 24 38
and dressed in the latest style
i finally caught up
with the pretty little thing
before she got out on the street
and she told she was
waiting on her old man
who was a policeman on the beat
hey, hey, pretty baby
girl, i'll see you another time
i'm talking to you, pretty baby
girl, i'll see you another time
if you're a policeman's woman
just talking to you is a crime
oh, no"
"they call us babes in arms
but we are babes in armour.
they laugh at babes in arms
but we'll be laughing far more.
on city street and farms
they'll hear a rising was cry.
youth will arrive,
let them know you are alive,
make it your cry!
they call us babes in arms
they think they must direct us.
but if we're babes in arms
we'll make them all respect us.
why have we got our arms,
what have we got our sight for?
play day is done,
we have a place in the sun
we must fight for.
so babes in arms to arms!"
"baby let me hold your hand
until i make you understand

our love we could never hide
ohh, baby, baby i want you by my side

i've got to go away   baby, it's cold out there
this evening has been   been hoping that you'd drop in
so very nice   i'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
my mother will start to worry   hey beautiful what's your hurry
and father will be pacing the floor   listen to that fireplace roar
so really i'd better scurry   beautiful, please don't hurry
well, maybe just a half a drink more   why don't you put some records on while i pour
and the neighbors might think   baby it's bad out there
say, what's in this drink?   no cabs to be had out there
i wish i knew how   your eyes are like starlight now
to break the spell   i'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
i ought to say no, no, no sir   mind if i move in closer?
at least i'm gonna say that i tried   what's the sense of hurting my pride?
i really can't stay   baby don't hold out
oh, but it's cold outside
i simply must go   but baby it's cold outside
the answer is no   but baby, it's cold there
the welcome has been   how lucky that you dropped in
so nice and warm   look out that window, man that's hard
my sister will be suspicious   gosh, your lips look delicious
my brother will be there at the door   waves upon a tropical shore
my maiden aunt's mind is vicious   gosh, your lips are delicious
well maybe just a cigarette more   oh, never such a blizzard before
i've got to go home   baby, you'll freeze out there
say, lend me your coat   it's up to your knees out there
you've really been grand   i thrill when you touch my hand
but don't you see   how can you do this thing to me
there's bound to be talk tomorrow   think of my lifelong sorrow
at least there will be plenty implied   if you caught pneumonia and died
i really can't stay   get over that old lie
oh, but it's cold outside."

because you're married to me.
not like a ballroom
a small room, a hall room

we will thrive on, keep alive on
just nothing but kisses
with mister and missus
on little blue chairs.
you sew your trousseau

dear bluesette don't despair
some blue boy is waiting just like you'
to find a someone to be true to,
two loving arms you can nestle in to stay.
get set, bluesette,
true love is coming,
your lonely heart soon will be humming.
pretty little blusette,

have you heard the news yet,
love's 'round the corner.
love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons
to make your next springtime
your gold weding ring time."

i went to my brother to ask for a loan cause i was busted
i hate to beg like a dog without his bone, but i'm busted
my brother said there ain't a thing i can do,
my wife and my kids are all down with the flu,
and i was just thinking about calling on you 'cause i'm busted.
well, i am no thief, but a man can go wrong when he's busted

where the food is free
where the landlord never comes near you

where the best of fellows can cheer you.
there's your own little room
so cool, not too much light
where you're one man for whom
no wife waits up at night
when day ends
you have lots of friends
who will guard you well while you slumber
safe from battle and strife
safe from the wind and gale
come with me to jail
you'll never have to fetch the milk
or walk the dog at early dawn
there's no  ""get up  you're late for work!""
while you rest in the pearly dawn
you're never bored by politics
you're privileged to miss a row
of tragedies by sophocles
and diatribes by cicero
your brother's wife will never come
on sunday noon to bring to you
her little son who plays the lute,
her little girl to sing to you
you can commit you little ""sin""
and relatives won't yell ""fie!""
you needn't take the annual trip
to the oracle at delphi
you snore and swear and stretch and yawn
in this, your strictly male house
the only way that sinners go to heaven
is in the jailhouse!"

she give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
she's got a fine sense of humor when i'm feeling low down
and when i come to her when the sun goes down
take away my trouble, take away my grief
take away my heartache, in the night like a thief
yes i need her in the daytime
yes i need her in the night
yes i want to throw my arms around her
kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

she gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day

yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul"

you can keep your rome,
i'm a hometown fellow

to dear old syracuse.
though i've worn out sandals
and my funds are low,
there's a light that's burning in the patio,
i wanna go back, go back
to dear old syracuse.
it is no metropolis,
it has no big acropolis,
and yet there is a quorum
of cuties in the forum.
though the boys wear tunics that are out of style
they will always greet me with a friendly smile.
i wanna go back, go back
to dear old syracuse.
both the nile and danube
are a silly bore.
i've a hometown river
that assaults my door.
i wanna go back, go back
to dear old syracuse.
when a man is lonely
it is good to know
there's a red light burning in the patio.
i wanna go back, go back
to dear old syracuse.
wives don't want divorces there,
the men are strong as horses there,
and should a man philander,
the goose forgives the gander.
when the search for love becomes a mania,
you can take the night boat to albania.
i wanna go back, go back
to dear old syracuse."
"tell me that it's true,
tell me you agree,
i was meant for you,
you were meant for me.
refrain
dearly beloved, how clearly i see,
somewhere in heaven you were fashioned for me,
angel eyes knew you,
angel voices led me to you;
nothing could save me,
fate gave me a sign;
i know that i'll be yours come shower or shine;
so i say merely,
dearly beloved be mine."

"girl, you're my sunshine

make all the pain stop
just like a river
keep love flowing

honey, don't change on me
don't change on me.....don't change on me
i used to wonder
where would i find
some kind of happiness
and peace of mind
i was living in darkness
but then you came
bringing the sunlight
easing my pain
if there's a heaven
then this is my prayer
lord knows i want to know you
if we should meet there
and then forever
we'll walk together
nothing but sunshine
no more stormy weather"

in that happy moment
i forgot all my past.
now i realize the way
the spell was cast,
at last,
refrain
once we walked alone
down by the river,
all the world our own
down by the river.
maybe the river made our love song start.
full was the river, yet more full my heart.
so i love you two,
you and the river,

down when the river rolls along"

"when an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
and touches with her hand the summer trees,
perhaps you'll understand what memories i own.
there's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,
a winding country lane all russet brown,
a frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
that spring of ours that started so april hearted,
seemed made for just a boy and girl.
i never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
so early, early.
darling if you care, please, let me know,
i'll meet you anywhere, i miss you so.
let's never have to share another early autumn."

without you around to applaud me
every night's just like closing night

and lot of transparent folks
so, please call, call and make a reservation

never complain;
never get tired,
don't mind the strain.
i always say, ""old man,
wait till you're through.
sunday will come 
thursday comes, too.
in those two days
think what you'll do.""
for they're the lovely days with you.
ev'ry sunday afternoon and thursday night,
we'll be free as birds in flight.
if on sunday afternoon we ever fight
we'll make up on thursday night.
leave the dishes,
dry your hands.
change your wishes
to commands.
ev'ry sunday afternoon we'll be polite,
but we'll make love on thursday night.
i work my life away
thinking of play.
what will i wear?
what will you say?
then i remind myself,
""old girl, you're strong,
and you're in love.
life can't go wrong.
smile your old smile,
sing your old song.
wait till those dear days come along.""
ev'ry sunday afternoon and thursday night,
we'll be free as birds in flight.
if on sunday afternoon we ever fight
we'll make up on thursday night.
i'm your slave, dear,

if you shave, dear,
we can kiss.
ev'ry sunday afternoon we'll be polite,

"oh, everytime we say goodbye i die a little
everytime we say goodbye i wonder why a little
why the gods above me who must be in the know
think so little of me
they allow you to go
and when you're near
there's such an air of spring about it
i can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
there's no love song finer
but how strange the change from major to minor
everytime we say goodbye
everytime we say goodbye i die a little
everytime we say goodbye i wonder why a little
why the gods above me who must be in the know

"i wonder what you're dreaming while you're sleeping.
i'll never know.
you'll never know.
now at last the world cannot come peeping
into the thoughts you call your own.
you close your eyes and you're alone.
you're in a world that' s bright and new
and there is no one in it but you.
comfy and cozy,
all the world is rosy.
ev'rybody loves you when you're asleep.
too late to start now
taking things apart now.
ev'rybody loves you when you're asleep.
you forget
your alphabet
when you've been counting sheep
does my dreamer know troubles will keep?
comfy and cozy
all the world is rosy.
ev'rybody loves you
when you're asleep."
"don't stamp your foot at me,
it's impolite
to stamp your foot at me
is not quite right.
at man's ingratitude
a woman winks,
but such an attitude just stinks.
i have eyes for you to give you dirty looks.
i have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife i'm learning to do
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
i've a powerful anesthesia in my fist,
and the perfect wrist to give your neck atwist.
there are hammerlock holds,
i've mastered a few,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
share for share, share alike,
you get struck each time i strike.
you for me  me for me 
i'll give you plenty of nothing.
i'm not yours for better but for worse,
and i've learned to give the well known witches' curse.
i've a terrible tongue, a temper for two,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
don't raise your voice at me,
that's very rude.
to raise your voice at me
is rather crude.
it's wrong essentially when woman yells,
and confidentially, it smells.
i'll converse with you on politics at length,
i'll protect you with my superhuman strength.
if you're ever attacked i'll scream and say, ""boo!''
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
i will never stray from home, i'll just stay put,
'cause i've got a brand new thing called athlete' s foot.
i'm a victim of colds, anemia, too,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
off to bed we will creep,
then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
till the birds start to peep.
i'll give you plenty of nothing.
i'll be yours forever and a day
if the first good breeze does not blow me away.
you're enough for one man, that's why i'll be true,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
you may have some things that i can't use at all.
when i look at you, your manly gifts are small.
i've a wonderful way of saying adieu,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
you won't know how good i am until you try
and you'll let my well of loneliness run dry.
i've a marvelous way of telling you no,
and ev'rything i've got belongs to you.
and ev'rything you want belongs to me!
and ev' rything you need belongs to me!
life has no shape or form
and no design.
it isn't life without
that fool of mine.
i used to gad about
with any chap
and now i'm sad about my sap.
he's a living thing that isn't quite alive,
he has brains enough for any child of five.
oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim,
but ev'rything i've got belongs to him.
he's a naughty brat that can't be left alone.
he has eyes for ev'ry skirt except my own.
even under a tree, he grabs for the limb,
but ev'rything i've got belongs to him.
something beats in his chest,
but it's just a pump at best.
i'm for him, he's for him.
he gives me plenty of nothing.
when i see that funny face, i know
something scared his mother twenty years ago.
but i'll never let go, he'll never be free!
till ev'rything he's got belongs to me!
and ev'rything i've got belongs to him!
and ev'rything i've got belongs to us!"

you give me fever,
when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight

fever all through the night

you give me fever,

fever when you hold me tight fever

ev'rybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
fever isn't such a new thing
fever started long ago
romeo loved juliet,
juliet she felt the same.
when he pout his arms around her,
he said, ""julie, baby, you're my flame.""
thou givest fever, when we kisseth
fever when thy flaming youth.
fever   i'm a fire
fever, yea i burn forsooth.
captain smith and pocahantas
had a very mad affair
when her daddy tried to kill him, she said,
""daddy o don't you dare.""
he gives me fever,
with his kisses
fever when he holds me tight
fever   i'm his missus
oh daddy won't you treat him right
now you've listened to my story
here's a point that i have made.
chicks were born to give you fever
be it fahrenheit or centigrade
they give you fever,
when you kiss them
fever if you live and learn.
fever   'til you sizzle

what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn"

you met someone and now you know how it feels   goody, goody
you gave him your heart too, just as i gave mine to you
and he broke it in little pieces, now how do you do
you lie awake just singing the blues all night   goody, goody
and you think that love's a barrel of dynamite
hooray and hallelujah, you had it coming to y'a
goody goody for him, goody goody for me
i hope your satisfied you rascal you, i hope your satisfied 'cause you got yours"
"as i was walking down the street last night
a pretty little girl came into sight
i bowed and smiled and asked her name
she said, ""hold it bud, i don't play that game""
i reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
there was lincoln staring her dead in the eyes.
on a greenback, greenback dollar bill
just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
she looked at me with that familiar desire
her eyes lit up like they were on fire
she said, ""my name's flo, and you're on the right track,
but look here, daddy, i wear furs on my back,
so if you want to have fun in this man's land,
let lincoln and jackson start shaking hands.""
on a greenback, greenback dollar bill
just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
i didn't know what i was getting into
but i popped lincoln and jackson, too
i didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight,
i just knew i'd have some fun last night
whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
if lincoln can't get it, jackson sure will
on a greenback, greenback dollar bill
just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
we went to a nightspot where the lights were low
dined and danced, and i was ready to go
i got out of my seat, and when flo arose,
she said, ""hold on daddy, while i powder my nose""
i sat back down with a smiling face,
while she went down to the powder place
with my greenback, greenback dollar bill
just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
the music stopped and the lights came on,
i looked around and saw i was all alone
i didn't know how long flo had been gone
but a nose powder sure didn't take that long
i left the place with tears in my eyes
as i waved lincoln and jackson a last goodbye
on a greenback, greenback dollar bill"
"the torch i carry is handsome, it's worth its heartache in ransom
now when that twilight steals, i know how the lady in the harbor feels
when i want rain, i get sunny weather, i'm just as blue, blue as the sky
since love has gone, i can't get myself together, guess i'll hang my tears out to dry
my friend ask me out, but i tell them i'm busy, i've got to get a new alibi
i hang around at home, and ask myself: ""where is she?""
guess i'll hang my tears out to dry
dry little tear drops, my little tear drops, moving on a stream of dreams
my little memories, those precious memories, remind me of our crazy schemes
then somebody says, just forget about her, but i gave that treatment a try
strangely enough, i got along without her
then one day she passed me right by   oh well"
"if you loved me half as much as i love you
you wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
you're nice to me when there's no one else around
you only build me up to let me down
if you missed me half as much as i miss you
you wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
i know that i would never be this blue"
"let me tell you about a girl i know,
she's my baby and she loves me so.
every morning when the sun comes up,
she brings me coffee in my favorite cup.
that's why i know, yes i know,
hallelujah i just love her so.
when i'm in trouble and i have no friends,
i know she'll go with me until the end.
everybody asks me how i know.
i smile at them and say, ""she told me so.""
that's why i know, oh, i know,
hallelujah, i just love her so.
now, if i call her on the telephone,
and tell her that i'm all alone.
by the time i count from one to four,
i hear her knocking on my door.
in the evening when the sun goes down
when there is nobody else around,
she kisses me and she holds me tight.
and tells me, ""daddy everything's alright.""
that's why i know, yes, i know,
hallelujah, i just love her so.

the thing is ended,
regrets are vain.
i'll never find
another half so sweet
and we'll never meet again.
i got impatient,
told him good bye
sad eyed,
out in the rain.
he was too good to me,
how can i get along now?
so close he stood to me
everything seems all wrong now.
he who had brought me the sun
making me smile,
that was his fun.

he'd never say go 'way now,

one glance at you and i knew that i looked
as if we two were booked!
when i met you my love called out ""hello!""
did you shout ""hello!"" too?
something inside me clicked and cried ""how do!""
yours replied ""how do!"" too.
i was so excited,
never stopped to talk,
while my feet invited
your feet for a walk!

it is tit for tat too!
i guess i once must have done something awful
and so god gave me you!

i've never read them through.
you gave me the sheepish look,

"hey! hey!
down on the farm we used to work all day,
but since the radio, we shirk all day.
all the hicks, down in the sticks, are g**.
church organ music used to fill the air;
now hosty tosty rhythms thrill the air.
we reap and sow while saxes blow away.
out in the field we let the radio stand.
plowing is grand in time to the band.
now that the radio is ruling the land
we hear the groans of saxophones.
it isn't toil to till the soil.
all of the country girls in drab away
do all the dances of the cabaret

and i was, burning up inside
my baby walked, in my bedroom

and then she said she would be right back
but i ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah
well i ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away
i remember so well when she slammed the door
but the girl didn't make it back no more
i ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day
well, i waited for 24 hours, and i was just about to starve to death
it didn't look like she was comin' back, so i had to look out for myself
well i called, the police department, to find out what they knew
they said, ""no, by heck, but we will get her yet"", because they was lookin' for her too
well i ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah
well i ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away
well i don't know what happened a cross the track
but i know my baby didn't make it back
i ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day
well i called, my dr. foster, and when the girl answered the phone
i got a funny feeling, the way she said dr. foster had gone
she said, ""he left with a lady patient, about 24 hours ago""
i added two and two, and here's what i got: i got i'll never see that girl no more
well i ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah

"all court conversation
to my observation
is naughty
and woefully pert;
with joy unabating
the ladies in waiting
are waiting
to dish thee the dirt;
such talk never charms me,
in sooth, it alarms me
when told by a hoyden or a valet.
mere greetings and glances
rouse talk of romances;
each kiss is a study in scarlet.
oh dear, when there's scandal about the court,
i blush!
oh dear, at the naughtiness they report,
i blush!
things they say sound very queer to me,
what they mean is never clear to me,
but it can't be very nice
the way they hush;
i blush!
such sights are not fit for a maiden's view.
i blush!
oh, dear, i know just what i ought to do,
i blush!
but you see,
i can't condemn a tale
if its end i do not know.
oh dear, i blush!
but i love it so!
oh dear, but the queen carries on a bit;
i blush!
oh, dear, though i breathe not a word of it,
i blush!
launcelot loveth her beauty well;
as a knight, he doth his duty well;
on the throne, they get so very warm,
they burn the plush.
i blush!
arthur is a rather unwary king;
i blush!
the queen made launcelot honorary king;
i blush!
to be sure,
it's none of my concern
if he kissed her once or twice.
oh dear, i blush!
but it's rather nice!
tristan told his heart to isolde in song;
i blush!
oh dear, but the song was six hours long;
i blush!
what they did was wrong beyond a doubt
if it took so long to sing about;
and the thought can make my lily
cheek to flush.
i blush!
oh dear, how they yodeled of love and death;
i blush!
they died not from love but from lack of breath;
i blush!
that it was
a proper way to die
it is, silly to pretend.
i blush, but oh dear,
what a lovely end!"

to be mad, to be yours alone!
grand tosee your face, feel your touch,

grand to be alive, to be young,
to be mad, to be yours alone!
grand tosee your face, feel your touch,
hear your voice say i'm all your own.
i didn't know what time it was
live was no prize.
i whanted love and here it was
shining out of your eyes.
i'm wise,"

i don't need no doctor
for my prescription to be filled
i don't need no doctor, i tell ya now
for my prescription to be filled
only my baby's arms,
could ever take away this chill
now the doctor say i need rest
before i need her tenderness
put me on the critical list
when all i need is her sweet kiss
he gave me a medicated lotion
but it didn't soothe
my emotion
i don't need no doctor
for my hope to live is gone
i don't need no doctor, no, no
wahhh! my hope to live is gone
all i need is my baby

"this used to be a grumpy,
crabbed old lad
look at your beamish boy now.
this used to be a jumpy,
silly and sad
what is simply joy now.
life was a canyon
too dark to view,
till a companion
was found like you.
i feel at home with you.
you always fit on
the knees that you sit on.
that' s why i feel at home with you.
i love to roam with you.
each place that we go,
you flatter my ego.
that' s why i feel at home with you.
i've a sensible,
comprehensible,
great respect for you.
there's a dash in it
of a passionate,
tender feeling, too.
you are a part of me,
something that's giving me
reason for living
that's why i feel at home with you."
"i don't want you to say pretty words
makin' music like the sweet singing birds
i don't want you to be no fool
and don't treat me no special way   just say
""i love you so""   now and then ....
'cause if you really, really love me, yeah,
i like to hear it some time
sometimes you ought to take me in your arms
and say the words that i want to hear
you ought to sooth me with your magic charms
call me ""sweetheart"", ""darling"" or ""dear""!
i don't want you to beg or cry
a little affection would satisfy
i don't want you to be upset
i just want to hear you say
""i love you so""   now and then ....
'cause if you really, really love me, yeah,
i like to hear it some time"
"i love you so much it hurts me
darlin, that's why i'm so blue

"have you heard i married an angel,
i'm sure that the change'll be awf'lly good for me.
have you heard an angel i married,
to heaven she's carried this fellow with a kiss,
she is sweet and gentle, so it isn't strange, when i'm sentimental
she loves me like an angel.
now you've heard, i married an angel,
this beautiful change will be awf'lly good for me."

"was it in tahiti?
were we on the nile?
long long ago, say an hour ago
i recall that i saw your smile
i remember you
you're the one who made my dreams come true
a few
kisses ago
i remember you
you're the one who said ""i love you, too""
i do, didn't you know?
i remember, too,
a distant bell
and stars that fell
like rain out of the blue
when my life is through
and the angels ask me to recall
the thrill of them all
then i shall tell them
i remember you
when my life is through
and the angels ask me to recall
the thrill of them all
then i shall tell them i remember, you"
"i took a trip on a train, and i thought about you.
i passed a shadowy lane, and i thought about you.
two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream.
moon shining down on some little town
and with each beam, the same old dream.
and every stop that we made, oh i thought about you.
and when i pulled down the shade, then i really felt blue.
i peaked through the crack and looked at the track,
the one goin' back to you, and what did i do?
i thought about you.
there were two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream.
moon shining down on some little town
and with each beam, the same old dream.
and then i peaked through the crack and i looked at that track,
the one goin' back to you, and what did i do?
i thought about you."
"1) i wake up crying
after tossin' and turnin'
and a yearnin' the whole night long
pretty baby oh my love since you went away
haven't spent a happy day
2) i wake up crying
after sobbin' and sighin'
and a wonderin' just what went wrong
pretty baby well i know i was good to you
why'd you go and make me blue
* i need your arms to hold me tight now
i need your lips to kiss me goodnight
i'm so unhappy on my own
don't don't leave me sad and lonely ( oh now now now
,well well well now baby )
3)i tell you i wake up crying
after tossin' and turnin'
and a yearnin' the whole night long
pretty baby why dont you please come back to me
and save me from this mesery
i want you to save me
ahhh save me baby
mhhhhhh ......."
"the sleepless nights   the daily fights
the quick toboggan   when you reach the heights
i miss the kisses   and i miss the bites
i wish i were in love again
the broken dates   the endless waits
the lovely loving   and the hateful hates
the conversation   with the flying plates
i wish i were in love again
no more pain   no more strain
now i'm sane   but i would rather be punched   drunk
the pulled out fur   of cat and cur
the fine mismating   of a him and her
i've learned my lesson   but i wish i were
in love again
the furtive sigh   the blackened eye
the words: ""i love you   'til the day i day""
the self deception   that believes the lie
i wish i were in love again
when love congeals   it soon reveals
the faint aroma   of performing seals
the double crossing   of a pair of heals
i wish i were in love again
no, no more care   no, no despair
now i'm all there    but i'd rather be puncdrunk
believe me sir   i much prefer
the classic battle   of a him and her
i don't like quiet   and i wish i were
in love again   in love again   in love again"
"there's no fool like an old  fool
when he paints his spectacles pink.
he acts his love in words
and he rhymes his love in ink.
an old fool is a bold fool
and he shines he spectacles up.
his time for love is short
so he quickly drains the cup.
i'll tell the one i love,
""i do not want the smile of you,
the glance of you, the heart of you,
but i want every part of you.""
i won't sing a song,
i won't dream a dream,
i won't drink the milk without the cream;
words of love are words,
sentiment is tame.
i don't want the name without the game.
you can see if you've the eyes for seeing,
i'm yours with every fibre of my being.
while your heart is weak
and my will is strong,
you'll be mine
and i won't sing a song."
"you have loved lots of girls in the sweet long ago
and each has meant heaven to you
you have vowed your affection to each one in turn
and have sworn to them all you'd be true
you have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune,
then you've left her to hunt a new game.
does it ever occur to you later my boy, that she's prob'ly doing the same?
if you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue,
just imagine the girl you love best
in the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
from the lips that you once fondly pressed
but the world moves apace and the loves of today
flit away with a smile and a tear,
so you can never tell who's kissing her now
or just whom you'll be kissing next year.
i wonder who's kissing her now, i wonder who's teaching her how,
i wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies.
i wonder who's buying the wine for lips that i used to call mine.
i wonder if she ever tells him of me, i wonder who's kissing her now."

when i was thirty five
but now the days grow short
i'm in the autumn of the year
and now i think of my life as vintage wine
from fine old kegs
from the brim to the dregs
and it poured sweet and clear
it was a very good year
it was a mess of good years"
"wooh now, let me tell you now
so many times i sat down and cried
you know there's no one to dry my weapin' eyes
baby i'm so in love with you now
and yet you broke my heart in two
although you've gone away
there's nothin' i can say but ""it's alright""
baby how could you be so mean?
you know sometimes i feel like i wanna scream
everytime i hear someone call your name now
you know it almost drives me insane
you took my love and gone
and you that we're wrong
but it's alright i wanted to keep on saying sure and you know someday you'll need these arms of mine i said it make take a long long time and when things aint what they used to be now you can bring your fine self home to me
to prove my love is true
i'll hug and kiss you too
and i'll say ""it's alright"""
"your sweet expression, the smile you gave me, the way you looked when we met,
it's easy to remember, but so hard to forget.
i hear you whisper, i'll always love you, i know it's over and yet,
it's easy to remember, but so hard to forget.
so i must dream to have your hands caress me, fingers press me tight,
i'd rather dream than have that lonely feeling stealing through the night.
each little moment is clear before me, and though it brings me regret,
it's easy to remember but so hard to forget."
"johnny could only sing one note
and the note he sings was this
ah!
poor johnny one note
sang out with ""gusto""
and just overlorded the place
poor johnny one note
yelled willy nilly
until he was bleu in the face
for holding one note was his ace
couldn't hear the brass
couldn't hear the drum
he was in a class
by himself, by gum!
poor johnny one note
got in aida
indeed a great chance to be brave
he took his one note
howled like the north wind
brought forth wind that made critics rave,
while verdi turned round in his grave!
couldn't hear the flute
or the big trombone
ev'ry one was mute
johnny stood alone.
cats and dogs stopped yapping
lions in the zoo
all were jealous of johnny's big trill
thunder claps stopped clapping,
traffic ceased its roar,
and they tell us niag'ra stood still.
he stopped the train whistles,
boat whistles,
steam whistles,
cop whistles,
all whistles bowed to his skill
sing johnny one note,
sing out with ""gusto"" and
just overwhelm all the crowd
ah!
so sing johnny one note, out loud!!
sing johnny one note
sing johnny one note out loud!"
"when we fought the yankees and annihilation was near,
who was there to lead the charge, that took us safe to the rear?
why it was jubilation t. cornpone.
old ""toot your own horn pone"",
jubilation t. cornpone, a man who knew no fear.
when we almost had 'em but the issue still was in doubt,
who suggested the retreat that turned it into a rout?
why it was jubilation t. cornpone.
old ""tattered and torn pone"",
jubilation t. cornpone, he kept us hidin' out.
with our ammunition gone and faced with utter defeat,
who was it that burned the crops and left us with nothin' to eat?
why it wuz jubilation t. cornpone.
old ""september morn pone"",
jubilation t. cornpone, the pants blown off his seat."

"a pretty girl and a bright young man
try to be friends but never can.
that is what perplexes
young folks of opposite sexes.
love likes to pull their legs a bit.
so you're either in love or out of it
love doesn't make much sense
but his technique is immense.
love never went to college
ignorant boy, that.
but think of the joy that he starts.
his work requires no knowledge
so he can do it
by using intuitive arts.
he just says, ""you two kids
start falling in love
i ain't got brains
but i reigns over all these parts.""
love never went to college
never had teaching
but yet he keeps reaching our hearts!"

if i heard the bells and the banjos ring
if two certain eyes with the look of danger
smiled a welcome warm as spring
if the tom tom in my heart sounded out a warning

""this is the one you've been waiting for""
oh, yes, i'd know
however wild it seems, you know i'd know
and i'd whisper
""come take my hand, proper stranger""
""don't go through life as a stranger""

your every plan i design
promise you'll always continue
to be mine
lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart

lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
when, two lips of coral, want to kiss
i say the devil is in you, and to resist you, i try
but if you didn't continue, i would die
lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart

swappin' our jokes, me and the ghost upstairs
and then she slaps his shroud and laughs out loud
and says ""oh boy, that'll paralyze all the crowd!""
jolly old ghost upstairs
he's quite a cook
he serves a beautiful drink
he wrote a book
and in invisible ink
i took a look
and the title 'pon the page
was ""the groups of wraith""
once in a while he brings a a gang of friends
does it in style, careless of what he spends
and though the place is small we have a ball

and my arms long for you, please come back to me
if you're in arizona, i'll follow you
if you're in minnesota, i'll be there, too
you'll have a milllion chances to start anew
because my love is endless for you
my heart cries for you, sighs for you, dies for you
and my arms long for you, please come back to me"
"i laughed at sweethearts i met at schools
all indiscreet hearts seemed romantic fools
a house in iceland was my heart's domain
i saw your eyes, now castles rise in spain!
i took one look at you, that's all i meant to do
and then my heart stood still,
my feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
and yet my heart stood still
though not a single word was spoken, i could tell you knew
that unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
i never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
my heart stood still
through all my school days, i hated boys
those april fool days brought me loveless joys
i read my plato, love, i thought a sin
but since your kiss, i'm reading missus glyn!"
"my romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
my romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
no month of may, no twinkling stars
no hide away, no softly guitars
my romance doesn't need a castle rising in spain
nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
wide awake i can make my most fantastic dreams come true
my romance doesn't need a thing but you
my romance doesn't need a thing but you"
"this moment, this minute
and each second in it
will leave a glow upon the sky
and as time goes by, it will never die
this will be my shining hour
calm and happy and bright
and in my dreams, your face will flower
through the darkness of the night
like the lights of home before me
or an angel, who's watching o'er me
this will be my shining hour
'til i'm with you again
this will be my shining hour
'til i'm with you again"
"the time has come to air my feelings
there's just so much confusion going down
i'm not the kind to be complaining
but sometimes you got to stand out from the crowd
everyone's got their own opinion
and you know i sure got mine
it's my world
don't you come a messin' with my world
i don't appreciate the fact some people just can't see
it's hurting you and me
it's my world
my world, your world, our world, one world
we all got to get it together
there's just no other place to go
if we can't find some peace with each other
then we'll be dead before you know
i don't have all the answers
i'm just one man who's searching for a change
it's my world
don't you come a messin' with my world
i don't appreciate the fact some people just can't see
it's hurting you and me
it's my world
my world, your world, our world, one world
i hear the cries of the people
from every single corner of this earth
where's the love, the compassion
where's the hope what's the future worth"
"if i don't see her each day, i miss her
gee what a thrill, each time i kiss her
believe me, i've got a case
ok, nancy with a laughin face
she takes the winter and makes ir summer
but summer could take some lessons from her
picture a tomboy in lace
that's my nancy with her laughin face

and i'm so glad to arrive, it's all so grand
it's easy to see you don't need a palace
to feel like alice in wonderland
back in ohio where i come from
i've done a lot of dreamin' and i've travelled some
but i never thought i'd see the day
when i ever took a ride on the santa fe
i would lean across my window sill
and hear the whistle echoin' across the hill
then i'd watch the lights till they fade away
on the atchison, topeka and the santa fe
what a thrill with the wheels a singin' ""westward ho""
right from the day i heard them start
'cross the kansas plains from new mexico
i guess i've got a little gypsy in my heart
when i'm old and grey and settled down
if i ever get a chance to sneak away from town
then i'll spend my busman's holiday
on the atchison, topeka and the santa fe
all aboard! , i can't believe i'm here at last
woo oo ooo! (when you go travellin', it's best for you
to take the atchison, topeka and the santa fe!)

"once upon a summertime, if you recall,
we stopped beside a little flower stall.
a bunch of bright forget me nots was all
i'd let you buy me.
once upon a summertime, just like today,
we laughed the happy afternoon away
and stole a kiss in ev'ry street caf‚.
you were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree.
i was as proud as any girl could be,
as if the mayor had offered me the key
to paris!
now, another wintertime has come and gone.
the pigeons feeding in the square have flown,
but i remember when the vespers chime
you loved me once upon a summertime."
"it's quarter to three, there's no one in the place except you and me
so, set 'em up, joe, i got a little story you oughta know
we're drinkin', my friend, to the end of a brief episode

i got the routine, so drop another nickel in the machine
i'm feelin' so bad, wish you'd make the music pretty and sad
could tell you a lot, but you've got to be true to your code
so, make it one for my baby and one more for the road
you'd never know it but buddy, i'm a kind of poet
and i got a lot of things to say
and when i'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to me
till it's all talked away
well that's how it goes and joe, i know your gettin' pretty anxious to close
so, thanks for the cheer, i hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear
this torch that i found must be drowned or it soon might explode
so, make it one for my baby and one more for the road
that long, long road"
"written by rudy toombs
one early morning, as i was walking
i met a woman, we started talking
i took her home, to get a few nips
but all i had was a mint julep
i donâ€™t remember just how i started
i only know that we should have parted
i stole a kiss, and then another
i didnâ€™t mean to take it further
one mint julep was the cause of it all
the lights were burning low, there in the parlor
when through the kitchen door, up popped her father
he said â€œi saw you when you kissed my daughter
better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!â€
i didnâ€™t know just what i was doing
i had to marry of face ruin
a mint julep, a mint julep
a mint julep, a mint julep
one mint julep was the cause of it all
now, i donâ€™t want to bore you with my troubles
but from now on iâ€™ll be thinking double
iâ€™m through with flirting and drinking whiskey
i got six extra children from a getting frisky
a mint julep, a mint julep
a mint julep, a mint julep"
"what is there to write? what is there to say?
same things happen everyday, not a thing to write, not a thing to say,
so i take my pen in hand and start the same old way.
dear, i thought i'd drop a line, the weather's cool, the folks are fine,
i'm in bed each night at nine, p. s. i love you.
yesterday we had some rain, but all in all, i can't complain,
was it dusty on the train, p. s. i love you.
write to the browns just as soon as you're able,
they came around to call, and i burned a hole in the dining room table,
and let me see, i guess that's all.
nothing else for me to say, and so i'll close but by the way,
everybody's thinking of you, p. s. i love you.
i do my best to obey all your wishes, i put a sign up ""think""
but i gotta buy us a new set of dishes, or wash the ones that are piled in the sink.
nothing else to tell you dear, except each day seems like a year,
every night i'm dreaming of you, p. s. i love you."
"people will say we're in love
why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
i know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
here is the gist, a practical list of ""don'ts"" for you.
don't throw bouquets at me
don't please my folks too much
don't laugh at my jokes too much
people will say we're in love!
don't sigh and gaze at me
your sighs are so like mine
your eyes mustn't glow like mine
people will say we're in love!
don't start collecting things
give me my rose and my glove.
sweetheart they're suspecting things
people will say we're in love.
don't praise my charm too much
don't look so vain with me
don't stand in the rain with me
people will say we're in love!
don't take my arm too much
don't keep your hand in mine
your hand feels so grand in mine
people will say we're in love!
don't dance all night with me
till the stars fade from above.
they'll see it's alright with me"

they can go away

there are things i believe should never be told, girl no
but you’re the only one i want to hold

precious thing
you know i love you
you’re such a wonderful thing
you make me dizzy whispering in my ear
send my love to the next, somewhere

ain’t it funny, right
i’m always losing things
but you’re like me you’ve known roaming
i hope i made you feel less alone
think of me as you roam
both:
oh, precious thing
you know i love you
you’re such a wonderful thing
girl, you make me dizzy whispering in my ear
you my love, till the next, somewhere
dee dee:
say no strength of freedom
is still as much yours as my thing
i know promises can be hard to keep
the price i pay to let, oh baby
was just to steal to steal my love from thee
both:
precious thing
you know i love you
you’re such a wonderful thing
you make me dizzy whispering in my ear
feel my love, till the next, somewhere"
"horace was a poet who adored the night;
in his verse he always underscored the night.
i recall what horace said in latin
a  ""never make your love affair a matinee!""

quiet night
and all around the calm and boring weather;
quiet night
no other sound, but hearts that beat together
you can almost hear the things i'm thinking;
you can almost see my heart take flight...

it's such a quiet night!"

heavy rain fallin', seems i hear your voice callin' ""it's all right.""

it seems like it's rainin' all over the world
i feel like it's rainin' all over the world
neon signs a flashin', taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
a distant moanin' of a train seems to play a sad refrain to the night
a rainy night in georgia, such a rainy night in georgia
lord, i believe it's rainin' all over the world

how many times i wondered
it still comes out the same

late at night when it's hard to rest i hold your picture to my chest and i feel fine

feel it's rainin' all over the world, kinda lonely now and it's rainin' all over the

bleak day, that workaway weekday,

sleep away,
deep away,
keep away your sighs.
sleepyhead, don't open your eyes!"

"somethings gotta give,
somethings gotta give
somethings gotta give
when an irresistible force such as you
meets and old immovable object like me
you can bet as sure as you live
something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
something's gotta give.
when an irrepressible smile such as yours
warms an old implacable heart such as mine

somewhere, somehow,
someone's gonna be kissed.
so en garde who knows what the fates have in store
from their vast mysterious sky?
i'll try hard ignoring those lips i adore
but how long can anyone try?

"somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
there's a land that i've heard of
once in a lullaby
somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream
really do come true
some day i'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
where troubles melt like lemon drops
away above the chimny tops
that's where you'll find me
somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
birds fly over the rainbow
why, then, oh why can't i?
if happy little blue birds fly
beyond the rainbow
why oh why, can't i?"
"soon, maybe not tomorrow
but soon there'll just be two of us.
soon you and i will borrow
the moon for just the two of us.
sweetly and so discreetly
we'll be completely alone
no other world, only our own.
now we must be contented
with schemes about the two of us.
yet we can have our sweet scented dreams
that will come true of us.
for presently and pleasantly
our hearts will be in tune
so soon, maybe not tomorrow, but soon."

what do i say when it's all over
and sorry seems to be the hardest word
2x chorus:
it's sad, so sad
it's a sad sad situation
and it's getting more and more absurd
it's sad , so sad
why can't we talk it over
oh, it seems to me
sorry seems to be the hardest word

what have i got to do to be heard
what do i do when lightening strikes me

"once there was a thing called spring
when the world was writing verses like yours and mine,
all the lads and girls would sing
when we sat at little tables and drank may wine.
now april, may and june
are sadly out of tune
life has stuck a pin in the boat.
spring is here
why doesn't my heart go dancing?
spring is here
why isn't the waltz entrancing?
no desire,
no ambition leads me
maybe it's because nobody needs me
spring is here
why doesn't the breeze delight me?
stars appear
why doesn't the night invite me?
maybe it's because nobody loves me
spring is here, i hear
maybe it's because nobody loves me
spring is here, i hear"

"i met my old lover
on the street last night
she seemed so glad to see me
i just smiled
and we talked about some old times
and we drank ourselves some beers
still crazy afler all these years
still crazy after all these years
i'm not the kind of man
who tends to socialize
i seem to lean on
old familiar ways
and i aint no fool for love songs
that whisper in my ears
still crazy after all these years
still crazy after all these years
four in the morning
crapped out
yawning
longing my life away
i'll never worry
why should l?
its all gonna fade
now i sit by my window
and i watch the cars
i fear i'll do some damage
one fine day
but i would not be convicted
by a jury of my peers
still crazy

"the summer wind, came blowin' in from across the sea
it lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me
all summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand
two sweethearts and the summer wind
like painted kites, those days and nights, they went flyin' by
the world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
then softer than a piper man one day it called to you
i lost you, i lost you to the summer wind
the autumn wind and the winter winds, they have come and gone
and still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on
and guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
my fickle friend, the summer wind
the summer wind
warm summer wind
mmm, the summer wind"

"oh lord i feel fine today
i'm walking on cloud nine today
i'm over that line today
happiness is finally mine today
i guess i'm just a lucky guy
and i'm prepared to tell you why
it's strictly on account of my
sweet potato pie
i'm the fellow that she loves the most
the main reason why she left the coast
she's my little girlziña
that much hotter that a jalapeño
tender like a night in june
sweeter than a honeymoon
brighter than a silver spoon
just as crazy as a loon
softer than a lullabye
deeper than the midnight sky
soulful as a baby's cry
my sweet potato pie
i used to see her around the neighborhood
i wonder how she grew up so good
she belonged to freddy and he was bad
and i never was ready to make him mad
i'm glad i had to wait awhile
a little bit too juvenile
i needed to refine my style
a silk suit and a crocodile smile
so let the whole damn world go by
'cause i just want to testify
from now on it's me and my
sweet potato pie"
"he was a cutie   i admit i used to care.
but it's my duty to myself to take the air.
i won't prevent you from eloping if you wish
may i present you with this tasty dish
take him, you don't have to pay for him
take him, it's free
take him, i won't make a play for him
he's not for me.
he has no head to think with
true, that high heart is asleep.
but he has eyes to wink with.
you can have him cheap.
keep him and just for the lure of it
marry him too.
keep him, for you can be sure of it
he can't keep you.
so take my old jalopy
keep him from falling apart.
take him, but don't ever take him to heart.
thanks little mousey, for the present and all that
but in this housy, i would rather keep a rat
only a wizard could reform that class of males
they say a lizard can not change his scales.
take him, i won't put a price on him
take him, he's yours
take him, pajamas look nice on him.
but how he snores!
thought he is well adjusted
certain things make him a wreck.
last year his arm was busted
reaching for a check.
his thoughts are seldom consecutive
he just can't write.
i know a movie executive
who's twice as bright,
lots of good luck, you'll need it
and you'll need aspirin, too
take him, but don't ever let him take you.
i hope that things will go well with him;
i bear no hate.
all i can say is the hell with him
he gets the gate.
so take my benediction,
take my old benedict, too
take him away, it's too good to be true."
"take these chains from my heart and set me free
you've grown cold and no longer care for me
all my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
take these chains from my heart and set me free
take these tears from my eyes and let me see
just a spark of the love that used to be
if you love somebody new, let me find a new love, too
take these chains from my heart and set me free
<instrumental interlude one full verse>
give my heart just a word of sympathy be as fair to my heart as you can be then if you no longer care for the love that's beating there
take these chains from my heart and set me free"
"if you cannot toss your heart gaily in the ring,
love me while the moment lingers,
if you cannot cross your heart that i'm everything,
try at least to cross your fingers.
talk to me, baby, tell me lies,
tell me lies as sweet as apple pie.
whisper you tremble with a wild desire
to light the fire in my eyes.
tell me i'm marvelous, exaggerate!
prevaricate if you must.
just talk to me, baby, soft and low,
then if you decide it's really so,
swear you be mine forever, otherwise just talk to me,
and tell me lies, lies, lies, lies,
great, big, great big lies."
"tangerine, she is all they claim
with her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
tangerine, when she dances by, senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
and i've seen toasts to tangerine
raised in every bar across the argentine
yes, she has them all on the run, but her heart belongs to just one
her heart belongs to tangerine
tangerine, she is all they say
with mascara'd eye and chapeaux by dache.
tangerine, with her lips of flame
if the color keeps, louis philippe's to blame.
and i've seen clothes on tangerine
where the label says ""from macy's mezzanine"".
yes, she's got the guys in a whirl, but she's only fooling one girl
she's only fooling tangerine!"

"long, long ago, in the land of the golden pools lived a magnificent green
gooberggoo. he dwelt in a wood pond, like all other goobergoos, who are the
frogs of fairyland, and sang the most beautiful songs. his mellow voice was
known, far and wide, for its charming medlodies.
""an emerald goobergoo i,
in the land of the golden pools,
my note, 'neath amber sky,
the elfin kingdom rules.""
thus sang the beautiful green goobergoo, on his
pebble in the wood pond, in the land of the golden
pools.
the kantan was jealous, furiously jealous, and
trouble brews when the wrath of the kantan is
aroused.
""who is this insignificant creature that dares to
reval me; who dares to insult the kantan?""
but the beautiful green goobergoo did not care a
bit. what if the kantan were a large bird with a long
beak? he, the beautiful green goobergoo, excelled in song.
""the kantan is indeed,
a large and mawkish bird,
whose voice is sore in need
of never being heard.""
at this the kantan became doubly furious, for he
hated the gentle ballads of the goobergoo. his delight was ragtime.
""oh, ma babe, waltz with me, kid.
gee, you've got me off ma lid.
kiddo, dear, you're sure the candy,
come and spiel wid your boy sandy.""
one bleak day, the kantan gobbled up the goobergoo, and, to this day, the
sweet singer of ballads lies vanquished by the ungainly bird of ragtime.
the beautiful wood pond has dried up, and in its place stands a vaudeville
theater managed by george m. cohan."

if you would win a tartar girl

, never knowing the meaning of the word
understanding , so in the next few minutes, im gonna
try to explain just exactly what it means
now wait a minute, listen , for instance , you take me
and my old lady , we gotta good thing goin
because i know if i dont work and pay the rent and the
bills and buy her fine pretty clothes to wear well ,
there are fifteen other guys just waitin round the
corner , and i dont care how much that woman loves me
, sheç£— gonna go out and find herself one of them who
will and thats why i believe that
* repeat
2) now listen i dont want you to think that this is a
one sided affair , no no
because my old lady also understands that a man must
have respect
what i mean is , if she must play around dont let me
catch her , because what i dont see cant hurt me , you
understand? but on the other hand , if i should ever
catch her im not gonna talk about a
and call her a bunch of bad names like you all might
no no mh
what im gonna do , im gonna go down town to the
hardware store and buy myself a double blade axe ,
come back , square off, and believe her soulç£— gonna
belong to the good lord

lonely with only a song.

blossoms in the breeze,
that we walked among,
lying in the hay,
games we used to play,
while the rounds were sung,
only yesterday, when the world was young.
wherever i go they mention my name,
and that in itself, is some sort of fame,
""come by for a drink, we're having a game,""
wherever i go i'm glad that i came.
the talk is quite g**, the company fine,
there's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine,
and beautiful girls and some of them mine,
but often my eyes see a diff'rent shine.
ah, the apple trees,
sunlit memories,
where the hammock swung,
on our backs we'd lie,
looking at the sky,
till the stars were strung,
only last july when the world was young.
ah, the apple trees,
blossoms in the breeze,
that we walked among,
lying in the hay,
games we used to play,

while sitting around, we often recall,
the laugh of the year, the night of them all.
the blonde who was so attractive that year,
some opening night that made us all cheer.
remember that time we all got so tight,
and jacques and antoine got into a fight.
the gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,
i laugh with the rest, it's all very bright."

we looked at each other in the same way then

the clothes you're wearing are the clothes, you wore
the smile you are smiling you were smiling then
but i can't remember where or when
some things that happened for the first time
seem to be happenin' again
and so it seems that we have met before
and laughed before, and loved before
but who knows where or when
some things that happened for the first time
seem to be happenin' again
and so it seems that we have met before

come from the dream you dream
thought has wings, and lots of things
are seldom what they seem

all that you live to day
things you do come back to you

willow weep for me

lovely summer dream
gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
sad as i can be
hear me willow and weep for me
whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
left my heart a breaking, and making a moan
murmur to the night to hide its starry light
so none will see me sighing and crying all alone

weep in sympathy
bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
when the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me
oh, weeping willow tree
weep in sympathy
bend your branches down along the ground and cover me"

as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid, the plans that we made
walking in a winter wonderland

ev'ry meeting's marvelous pastime.
you're increasingly sweet,
so whenever we happened to met
i greet you ...
with a song in my heart
i behold your adorable face.
just a song at the start
but it soon is a hymn to your grace.
when the music swells
i'm touching you hand
it tells that your're standing near, and ..
at the sound of your voice
heaven opens his portals to me.
can i help but rejoice
that a song such as ours came to be?
but i always knew
i would live life through
with a song in my heart for you.
oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
and these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
and the words in my ears
will resound for the rest of my years.
in the morning i find with delight
not a note of our music is played out.
it will be just as sweet,
and an air that i'll live to repeat:
i greet you ...
with a song in my heart
i behold your adorable face.
just a song at the start
but it soon is a hymn to your grace.
when the music swells
i'm touching you hand
it tells that you're standing near, and ..
at the sound of your voice
heaven opens his portals to me.
can i help but rejoice
that a song such as ours came to be?
but i always knew
i would live life through
with a song in my heart for you."
"without a song the day would never end
without a song the road would never bend
when things go wrong a man ain't got a friend
without a song
that field of corn would never see a plow
that field of corn would be deserted now
a man is born but he's no good no how
without a song
i got my trouble and woe but, sure as i know, the jordan will roll
and i'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
i'll never know what makes the rain to fall
i'll never know what makes that grass so tall
i only know there ain't no love at all
without a song
<instrumental>
i've a got my trouble and woe and, sure as i know, the jordan will roll
and i'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
i'll a never know what makes that rain to fall
i'll never know what makes the grass so tall
i only know there ain't no love at all"
"you promised me love
that would never die
that promise you've made
was only a lie.
now after you've gone
all alone i've pined
for all that i've got
was a worried mind.
i gave you a ring
i gave you a home
you promised me love
that you'd never wrong.
i bought you fine clothes
and i bought you wine
but all that i got
was a worried mind.
and when i was down
you've just left me there
i needed you so
but you didn't care.
you found a new love
and a home so fine
but all that i've got
is a worried mind..."
"you must have been a beautiful baby
you must have been a wonderful child
when you were only starting to go to kindergarten
i bet you drove the little boys wild.
and when it came to winning blue ribboms
you must have shown the other kids how.
i can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
you must have made the cutest bow.
you must've been a beautiful baby
'cause baby look at you now.
does your mother realize
the stork delivered quite a prize
the day he left you on the family tree?
does your dad appreciate
that you're merely supergreat
the miracle of any century?
if they don't just send them both to me.
you must have been a beautiful baby
you must have been a wonderful child.
when you were only starting to go to kindergarten
i bet you drove the little boys wild.
and when it came to winning blue ribboms
you must have shown the other kids how.
i can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
you must have made the cutest bow.
you must've been a beautiful baby
'cause baby look at you now."
"i was never able to recite a fable
that would make the party bright;
sitting at the table i was never able
to become the host's delight;
but now you've given me my after dinner story,
i'll just describe you as you are in all your glory.
you were never lovelier,
you were never so fair,
dreams were never lovelier,
pardon me if i stare.
down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face;
i can only say they chose the proper place.
you were never lovelier,
and to coin a new phrase;
i was never luckier in my palmiest days.
make a note, and you can quote me,
honor bright,
you were never lovelier than you are tonight."
"the news is out, all over town
that you've been seen, a runnin' round
i know that i should leave but then
i just can't go, you win again
this heart of mine could never see
what everybody knew but me
just trusting you was my great sin
what can i do, you win again
i'm sorry for your victim now
'cause soon his head like mine will bow
you'll use his heart, but all in vain
and someday say, you win again
you have no heart, you have no shame
you take true love and give the blame
i guess that i should not complain
i love you still, you win again"
"1) i want you , i need you , im all packed up to go
but darlin , if you love me , you wont let me go
2) if a loveç£— a true love , it never runs smooth you
know
so if your love is a true love , you wont let me go
* if you dont say you love me , im gonna walk right
out the door
and ill hope that youç£l stop me , so i can hear you

3) i tell you i love you , yes i love you

4) hey i love you now , i say i love you
oh with all my heart and soul
so darlin well if you love me
i know you wont let me go
girl i know you wont let me go"
"time is a healer
but it cannot heal my heart,
my mind says i've forgotten you
and then i feel my heart.
though the miles lie between us
but your fingers touch my own,
you're never far away from me
for you're too much my own.
you're nearer
than my head is to my pillow,
nearer than the wind is to the willow.
dearer than the rain is
to the earth below,
precious as the sun to
the things that grow.
you're nearer than the ivy to the wall is,
nearer than the winter to the fall is,
leave me
but when you're away
you'll know you're nearer
for i love you so."
"1) you got me cryin again , you got me cryin again
what is this love all about , im in and then im out
2) your kisses right from the start ,
they came from your lips not your heart
you made me happy and then , somebody new looks good
to you
you got me cryin again , just cryin for you
2) repeat"
"your cheatin' heart will make you weep
you'll cry and cry and try to sleep
but sleep won't come the whole night through
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
when tears come down like fallin' rain
you'll toss around and call my name
you're gonna walk that floor the way i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
your cheatin' heart will pine some day ,
and crave the love,you threw away.
the time will come when you'll be blue,
your cheatin' heart will tell on you.
when tears come down like fallin' rain
you'll toss around and call my name
you're gonna walk that floor the way i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
your cheatin' heart will tell on you"
"dearest one
i write what i'm afraid to speak,
i'm weak when i'm with you,
tears of love are causing
all the ink to blot
so what am i to do?
hoping to find the phrases,
groping to find each word,
how they all burn like blazes,
now they all seem absurd.
though i don't know where to end
and to begin
you must give in because
i'm yours sincerely,
the one who loves you dearly,
to think about it nearly takes
my breath away.
very truly
my passion is unruly,
a dream of you is newly born
each night and day.
oh but my thoughts are fervent,
how can i make them plain?
ever your humble servant
faithfully i remain.
i'm intending
to find a happy ending
because i love you dearly
i'm sincerely yours."
