"come on come on
i see no changes.
wake up in the morning and i ask myself,
""is life worth living?
should i blast myself?""
i'm tired of bein' poor
and even worse i'm black.
my stomach hurts,
so i'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.
cops give a damn about a negro?
pull the trigger, kill a n****, he's a hero.
give the crack to the kids who the hell cares?
one less hungry mouth on the welfare.
first ship 'em dope
and let 'em deal the brothers.
give 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other.
""it's time to fight back"", that's what huey said.
2 shots in the dark now huey's dead.
i got love for my brother,
but we can never go nowhere
unless we share with each other.
we gotta start makin' changes.
learn to see me as a brother
'stead of 2 distant strangers.
and that's how it's supposed to be.
how can the devil take a brother
if he's close to me?
i'd love to go back to when we played as kids,
but things change, and that's the way it is.
chorus
that's just the way it is.
things'll never be the same.
that's just the way it is. aww yeah...
that's just the way it is.
things'll never be the same.
that's just the way it is. aww yeah...
i see no changes. all i see is racist faces.
misplaced hate makes disgrace for races we under.
i wonder what it takes to make this one better place...
let's erase the wasted.
take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right.
'cause mo' black than white
is smokin' crack tonight.
and only time we chill is when we kill each other.
it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other.
and although it seems heaven sent,
we ain't ready to see a black president, uhh.
it ain't a secret don't conceal the fact...
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks.
but some things will never change.
try to show another way,
but they stayin' in the dope game.
now tell me what's a mother to do?
bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you.
you gotta operate the easy way.
""i made a g today"" but you made it in a sleazy way.
sellin' crack to the kids. ""i gotta get paid,""
well hey, well that's the way it is.
that's just the way it is.
things'll never be the same.
that's just the way it is. aww yeah...
we gotta make a change...
it's time for us as a people
to start makin' some changes.
let's change the way we eat,
let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other.
you see the old way wasn't working
so it's on us to do
what we gotta do, to survive.
and still i see no changes.
can't a brother get a little peace?
there's war on the streets & the war in the middle east.
instead of war on poverty,
they got a war on drugs
so the police can bother me.
and i ain't never did a crime i ain't have to do.
but now i'm back with the facts
givin' 'em back to you.
don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,
crack you up and pimp smack you up.
you gotta learn to hold ya own.
they get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone.
but tell the cops they can't touch this.
i don't trust this, when they try to rush
i bust this.
that's the sound of my tune.
you say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no fool.
and as long as i stay black,
i gotta stay strapped & i never get to lay back.
'cause i always got to worry
'bout the pay backs.
some buck that i roughed up way back...
comin' back after all these years.
rat a tat tat tat tat. that's the way it is. uhh
 that's just the way it is.
things'll never be the same.
that's just the way it is. aww yeah...
some things never change."

"you are appreciated...
when i was young, me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time, i never thought i'd see your face
ain't no woman alive
that can take my mama's place
suspended from school, scared to go home
i was a fool
with the big boys breaking all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister
over the years we was poorer
than other little kids
and even though we had different daddies
the same drama
when things went wrong, we blamed mama
i reminised on the stress i caused, it was hell
hugging on my mama from a jail cell
and who'ed think in elementary,
heeeey i'd see the penitentiary
one day running from the police, that's right
momma catch me  put a whoop'en to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama,
you always was the black queen, mama
i finally understand for a woman
it ain't easy  trying to raise a man
ya always was commited,
a poor single mother on welfare,
tell me how you did
there's no way i can pay you back
but the plan is to show you that i understand.
you are appreciated......
chorus
laaaaady, don't you know we luv ya
sweeeet laaaady, place no one above ya
sweeeet laaaady, don't you know we luv ya
ain't nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy, cause the coward wasn't there
he passed away and i didn't cry
cause my anger, wouldn't let me feel
for a stranger
they say i'm wrong and i'm heartless
but all along
i was looking for a father  he was gone
i hung around with the thug's
and even knew they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin'
i needed money on my own so i started slangin'
i ain't guilty cause, even though i sell rocks
it feels good, putting money in your mailbox
i love paying rent when the rents due
hope you got the diamond necklace
that i sent to you
cause when i was low,
you was there for me
and never left me alone, because you cared for me
and i can see you coming home after work late
you in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
just working with the scraps she was givin'
and mama made miracles every thanksgiving
but now the road got rough, you're alone
trying to raise two bad kids on your own
and there's no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated.....
chorus
laaaaady, don't you know we luv ya
sweeeet laaaady, place no one above ya
sweeeet laaaady, don't you know we luv ya
pour out some liquor and i reminisce it
cause through the drama,
i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that i'm hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act craaaazy
i gotta thank the lord that you maaaade me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret, always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night,
there's a brighter day
everything will be alright if you hold on
it's a struggle
everyday gotta roll on
and there's no way i can pay you back
but my plan is to show you that i understand
you are appreciated...

laaaaady, don't you know we luv ya
sweeeet laaaady, place no one above ya
sweeeet laaaady, don't you know we luv ya,

"something for my godson elijah and a little girl named corinne.
verse one:
some say that the darker is the sweetest fruit, is its juice
i say the darker the flesh then the deeper the ro
i give a holler to my sisters on welfare
tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
and uhh, i know they like to beat ya down a lot
when you come around the block brothas clown a lot
but please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
and when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
and if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
cause sista you don't need him
and i ain't tryin to gas ya up, i just call em how i see em
you know it makes me unhappy when brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
i think it's time to kill for our women
time to heal our women, be real to our women
and if we don't we'll have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies, that make the babies
and since a man can't make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up
chorus
eeewww child things are gonna get easier
eeewww child things are gonna get brighter
eeewww child things are gonna get easier
eeewww child things are gonna get brighter
verse two:
aiyyo, i remember marvin g**e, used to sing ta me
he had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
and suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
and though we had it rough, we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life, to raise me right
and all i had ta give her was my pipe dream
of how i'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
i'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
it's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
and in the end it seems i'm headin for tha pen
i try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
it's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems tha rain'll never let up
i try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
you know it's funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
it ain't no hope for tha future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
we ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
and even though you're fed up
huh, ya got to keep your head up
chorus
verse three:
and uhh
to all the ladies havin babies on they own
i know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
thank the lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
cause i think we can make it, in fact, i'm sure
and if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo'
you can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
because there's too many things for you to deal with
dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
while tears, is rollin down your cheeks
ya steady hopin things don't all down this week
cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
i was given this world i didn't make it
and now my son's getten older and older and cold
from havin the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin benz
i'm still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
and it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
please... you got to keep your head up"
"turn it up loud
hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
you a little sucker for love, right?
word up, hahahahaha
i shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start,
taught me so many lessons
how not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
when this began we was the perfect match,
perhaps we had some problems but we workin at it,
and now the arguments are gettin loud,
i wanna stay but i can't help from walkin out,
just throw it away
just take my hand and understand, if you could see
i never planned to be ya man,
it just wasn't me
but now i'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
i wanna shelter you from harm,
don't be alarmed
your attitude was the cause,
you got me stressin soon as i opened up the door
with your jealous questions
like ""when can i be""
you're killin me with your jealousy
now my ambition's to be free
i can't breathe, cause soon as i leave,
it's like a trap
i hear you callin me to come back, i'm a sucka for love
... that's right, sucka for love
 x2
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
just when i thought i broke away and i'm feelin happy
you try to trap me say you pregnant
and guess who the daddy
don't wanna fall for it,
but in this case what could i do? so now i'm back
to makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
what if i'm wrong...
a trick to keep me on and on
tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
i'm bout to lose my composure,
i'm gettin close
to packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost
tell me who knows, a peaceful place where i can go
to clear my head i'm feelin low,
losin control
my heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive, and now...
you gettin calls at the house,
guess you cheatin
that's all i need to hear cause i'm leavin,
i'm out the door never no more will you see me,
this is the end cause now i know you've been cheatin
i'm a sucka for love
... damn, sucka for love... sucka for love
... sucka for love
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow
and you still stay as you sit and pray...
hoping the beatings'll go away
it wasn't always a hit and run relationship
it use to be love, happiness and companionship
remember when i treated you good
i moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
me and you a happy home, when it was on
i had a love to call my own
i shoulda seen you was trouble
but i was lost, trapped in your eyes
preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
you had a man and i knew it, you told me
don't worry bout it we can do it
now i'm under pressure
make a decision cause i'm waitin, when i'm alone
i'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh
i wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
but i need your faith in me,
i'm a sucka for love
... sucka for love, know you ain't right g
but yet i'ma sucka for love
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
... i'ma sucka for love, sucka for love
... sucka for love"

so picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
i could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
sheddin quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me,
""what would you do if it was you?""
couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
i tried to trade places in the tragedy
i couldn't picture three crazed n****z grabbin me
for just a moment i was trapped in the pain, lord come and take me
four n****z violated, they chased and they raped me
even though it wasn't me, i could feel the grief
thinkin with your brains blown that would make the pain go

"dear lord
as we down here, struggle for as long as we know
in search of a paradise to touch dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go
the only place for us
i know, try to make the best of bad situations
seems to be my life's story
ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
and can't nobody live this life for me
it's a ride y'all, a long hard ride
somebody break me i'm dreamin, i started as a seed the semen
swimmin upstream, planted in the womb while screamin
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin stop
from a single drop, this is what they got
not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
only plan he had for momma was to f*** her and abuse her
even as a little seed, i could see his plan for me
stranded on welfare, another broken family
now what was i to be, a product of this heated passion
momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
look how it began, nobody gave a f*** about me
pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
how can i survive? got me askin white jesus
will a n**** live or die, cause the lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
no sunny days and we only play sometimes
when everybody's sleepin
i open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin
i can live or die, hope i get some money 'fore i'm gone
i'm only 19, i'm tryin to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin to slang rocks
i'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
you can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
you can ask my man ishmael reed
keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
meet up at the cemetary then get smoked out, pass the weed n****
that hennessey'll keep me keyed n****
everywhere i go n****z holla at me, ""keep it real g""
and my reply til they kill me
act up if you feel me, i was born not to make it but i did
the tribulations of a ghetto kid, still i rise
still i  i rise please give me to the sky and if  i die i don't want you to cry
i stay sharp as always
runnin ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
dumpin crews like two's, n**** all day
secrets of war prepare me for the worst
a life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
but now my dreams it seeems though, be placin triple beams and things bro
diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin out my jeans
now i plan to keep my glock cocked
if trouble was searchin for me then why not?
show em what i'm made of plus raised on, on my block
chancellor ave, where many turn to the street, thugs snatchin bags
we out for power, makin cash it wasn't fast it'll make me mad
i'm just like, pimpin
my homey on the corner with his gat tucked, in
youngest they buckin somethin the life he leads
the life he don't need, don't we all know
he tryin to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise
dreams of lost hope
i hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still i rise now i float cowards ghost
whenever we come around, i'm runnin down
clutchin a pound, live as sirens, duckin the sound
i used to hustle with my moms til the sun came
my homey harm doin time from this drug game
stolen cars, war scars, born a outlaw
behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
crackheads only ten learn to duck cops
in ninety six my glock's my plastic, passion for blastin bastards
no faces for open caskets, peelin ya cap backwards
ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
i send my missiles through your mattress
leavin holes in your body like a cactus
while me and my crew be boppin more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherf***in jeans poppin
leavin ya spleen to pick up
half of you n****z is softer than a snicker
let's go to war and see who draw quicker
and still i rise, and still i rise...
still i  i rise please give me to the sky and if  i die i don't want you to cry
still i  i rise please give me to the sky and if  i die i don't want you to cry

picturin' pitiful punk n****s coppin' pleas
puffin' weed as i position myself to clock gs
my enemies scatter in suicidal situations
never the witness to wicked shit that they was facin'
pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
evadin' the playa hatin tricks, while hittin switches
b****es is badmouthin', cuz ballin' motherf***ers is bold
but trust me holms, the game should be sold
sick of pscyhotic society, somebody save me
addicted to drama, so even mama couldn't raise me
even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
i run in the streets and puffin' weed with my peeps
i'm duckin' the cops, i hit the weed as i'm clutchin' my glock

polishin' pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
when i get to poppin', n****s is droppin', then they done
callin' the coroner, come collect the f***in' corpse
he got hit by a killer, preoccupied with bein boss
revenge is the method, whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
adversaries will overdose over deadly notes
jealous n****s and broke b****es equal packed jails
hit the block and fill your pockets makin' crack sales
picture perfection pursuin' paper with a passion
visions of prison where all the pussies that i blasted
running with criminal, individuals with no remorse
try to stop me, my pistol possee using deadly force
in my brain, all i can think about is fame
the police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
i'm seeing cemetary photos of my peers
conversatin' like they still here, if i die tonite
chorus
if i die 2nite
scared to die n****, is ya?

plottin on murderin motherf***ers before they get you
pray to the heavens, .357s to the sky
and i hope i'm forgiven for thug livin when i die

a stress free life, and a spot for drug dealers
pissin while practicin' how to pimp and be a player
overdose of a d*** while drinking liquor when i lay yah
pistol whippin any simps, for bein petrified and lame
disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
going insane, never die, i live eternal, who shall i fear?

"between you and biggie
was like who's gone who's gone who who rules thethe n**** kingdom and shit, basically
you know what i am saying shit
i was like this is like a f***in election
it is an election...
you know what i'm sayin
me and biggie situation is smaller than that
me and biggie situation is like
metro...we got a black male shot...tupac shakur was shot seven times
you know, i wonder if they'll laugh when i am dead
why am i fighting to live, if i'm just living to fight
why am i trying to see, when there aint nothing insight
why i am i trying to give, when no one gives me a try
why am i dying to live, if i'm just living to die
i am destroyin them...
check it, i grew up a f***in screw up
got introduced to the game, got a ounce and f***in blew up
choppin rocks overnight
the n**** biggie smalls tryin ta turn into the black frank white
we had to grow dreads to change our description
two cops is on the milk box missin
show they toes you know they got stepped on
a fist full of bullets a chest full of teflon
run from the police picture that, n**** i'm too fat
i f*** around and catch a asthma attack
that's why i bust back,  it don't phase me
when he drop, take his glock, and i'm swayze
summer break, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
laid back, i got some money to make, motherf***er
you know, i wonder if they'll laugh when i am dead
why am i fighting to live, if i'm just living to fight
why am i trying to see, when there aint nothing insight
why i am i trying to give, when no one gives me a try
why am i dying to live, if i'm just living to die
i am destroyin them...
it's on me...
but still i'm havin memories of high speeds, when the cops crash
as i laugh pushin the gas while my glocks blast
we was young, and we was dumb but we had heart
in the dark will we survive through the bad parts?
many dreams is what i had, and plenty wishes
no hesitation in extermination of these snitches
envious b****es they still continue to pursue me
a couple of movies now the whole world tryin to screw me
even the cops tried to sue me
so what can i do but stay true, sippin 22's a brewin
now the medias tryin to test me got the press askin questions, tryin to stress me
misery is all i see, thats my mind's state
my history with the police is shakin' the crime rate
ma main man had 2 strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
he screamed 'thug life!' and emptied a clip
gots tired of runnin from the police
you know, i wonder if they'll laugh when i am dead
why am i fighting to live, if i'm just living to fight
why am i trying to see, when there aint nothing insight
why i am i trying to give, when no one gives me a try
why am i dying to live, if i'm just living to die
i am destroyin them..."

i keep my finger on the trigga of my glock ridin' down the block
lickin' shots at the punk ass cops
and spittin' game through my mobile phone

i'm drivin' drunk on the freeway
so take it easy
lookin' for a new face to skeez man
everybody lookin' for a nut
but i'm searching for the big bucks

rather die than be stuck
in a one room shack and
kickin' back daydreaming with the 9 in my lap
so how's that from the mind of a thug n****
bought a fo' five cuz i heard that the slug's bigger
figure the first muthaf***a to jump

"n..g.g.a feat. jadakiss
 yeah.. uh..
who's afraid of the punk police?
n****z run the streets, no justice no peace
f*** the law, i'd rather draw than do time
don't f*** with mine 'cross the line
my two nines go biya biya when i shoot 'em
korean motherf***ers was crooked
so n****z had to burn and loot 'em
now the streets ain't safe at night, my n****z
.. uhh, straight take his life
so don't sleep when my team creep up, how we hit 'em
empty the clip, then dip cause we did 'em
lickin off shots for latasha, that's proper
love for my n****z but a glock for the coppers
so what the f*** you wanna do now?
i packed a nine last year
in ninety nine i'm packin two now
and even if they pull they triggers, they can shoot one man
but nuttin's gonna stop the plan of true n****z
 yeah, n****z   can't f*** with us
 yeah, n****z
cause bein a n**** means you love n****z, haha
 i was raised in this society so there's no way you can
expect me to be a perfect person, cause i'ma do what i'ma do
 ha!!! uhh..
aiyyo!
my dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em bedrocks
n****z is like photographers, all they take is headshots
your last words'll be, damn, what's all these red dots?
n****z nowadays they worry me
my bars is therapy, as long as you usin 'em thoroughly
muah 'til the day that they bury me
my n****z is stronger and tighter now than they probably ever be
and i'm a product of the 70's
the hood got n****z on punishment, that's why they never leave
if i ain't eatin wit'chu i'm probably beefin wit'chu
if no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin wit'chu
i know you got a gun but i'm hopin you keep it wit'chu
cause unfortunately i'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol and
know what the llama do, shady/aftermath
ruff ryders, d block, and of course amaru
lot of people honor you, probably cause the way
that you used to bring the drama to, whoever you wanted to
you a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
but, anyway, life goes on
so i'll see you when i art in heaven like our fathers do
 n****! can't f*** with us"
"they got a n****
shedding tears, reminiscing on my past fears
cause ""shit"" was hectic for me last year.
it appears that i've been marked for death, my
heartless breath
the underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
and no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary
for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
but at times unnecessary, i'm getting worried
teardrops and closed caskets,
the three strikes law is drastic
and certain death for us ghetto bastards.
what can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
life in the pen ain't for me, cause i'd rather die
but don't cry through your despair
i wonder if the lord still cares, for us n****s on
welfare
and who cares if we survive
the only time they notice a n**** is when he's
clutching on a four five
my neighborhood ain't the same
cause all these little babies going crazy and they
suffering in the game
and i swear it's like a trap
but i ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when
i go back
hoes show me love, n****s give me props
forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block
living life is but a dream
hard times is all we see every block is kinda mean
but on our block we still prayyyyyy...
but on our block we still prayyyyyy...
now shit's constantly hot, on my block,
it never fails to be gunshots
can't explain a mother's pain,
when her son drops
black male slipping in hail
when will we prevail
fearing jail
but crack sales got me living well
and the system's suicidal with this thug's life
staying strapped forever trapped
in this drug life
god help me, cause i'm starving,
can't get a job
so i resort to violent robberies,
my life is hard can't sleep
cause all the dirt
make my heart hurt
put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
mislead from childhood where i went astray
till this day i still pray for a better way
can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
from the start i felt the racism cause i'm dark
couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
hit the bar and played the star,
everywhere i went in my heart,
i felt alone out here on my own
i close my eyes and picture home... on my block
and i can't help but wonder why,
so many young kids had to die
caught strays from ak's and the driveby
swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
brothers cry for broken lives,
mama come inside
cause our block is filled with danger
used to be a close knit community
but now we're all cold strangers
time changes us to stone
them crack pipes
all up and down the block
exterminating black life
but i can't blame the dealers
my mama's welfare check
has brought the next man
chrome wheels
shit's real, i know ya feel, my tragedy
a single mother with a problem child,
daddy free
hanging out picking up game,
sipping cheap liquor
gamin the hoochies
hoping i can get to sleep with her
it's a man's world, staying strapped
fantasies of a n**** living phat, but held back
pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
wide eyed and losing focus... on my block
and block parties in the projects
lasting way past daylight
a young n**** learned to break night
used to play fight with my homies
but they stuck in the pen
i send them ends, but it's tough on a friend,
in my mind
i see the same motherf***ers balling
alcohol will make a lazy n**** slip and fall,
miss his call
i know the young n****s understand this
growing up in this world
where everything is scandalous
i reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
trying to cop a slice of pizza
with my last dime
can't explain, just what attracts me
to this dirty game
gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
and what's strange is everybody knows my name,
swear, they all know me
and lots of cash make a n**** change
i hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
for all the n****s that i lost to the game... from my
block
[chorus w/ minor variations; kids repeat last line
over and over]
rest in peace to all the motherf***ers
who passed away
from all the blocks that i'm from
one twelve street, 7th avenue, new york, uptown,
knahmsayin?
183rd and walt,
my block, that's right
122nd and morningside, my block, that's right
decatur avenue, baltimore, my block, that's right
in the jungle of marin city, that's my block, that's
right
los angeles, haha, that's my block too
oakland, can't forget oaktown,
that's my block for sure
and all the other blocks around this motherf***er
houston, florida, st. louis,
tennessee, miami, chicago
all y'all n****s stay kicking up dust
represent the motherf***ing block"

though, she could never understand why,
some underhanded plans, witness a man die,
was only 15, shoulda been a beauty queen, still
see her crying by the caskets when her parents got killed
little girl, dont cry, cause even though they died,
you can best believe they watchin over thee from the sky
never asked for this misery, but look at what you gettin
its a blessin in disguise, when ya find out ya pregnant
no money, no home and even though you all alone,
you got to do this on your own, so baby go, i wish you luck
and if you need me, call, just come to me, let me feed you all
i can understand, the way it feels when ya fightin the world
facin' all this drama, when mama's just a little girl
chorus:
mama...dont know why...mamas just a little girl
even if she is a knight...
time aint on her side, cause mamas just a little girl
she gotta hold her head up high, ohhh
verse 2:
at 16, what a beautiful thing
the very essence of a jet black ebony queen
and who could tell, she'd get pregnant at an early age?
she didnt listen, had sex, watch her belly raise
heyyyy, got vialated by someone she dated
if this is fate, i hate to see the seed she created
and so we waited, though it takes time...to build a body and a mind
she reclines, 9 months, then finally its time
what do we find? little grown boy, ya mind, what a torchered soul
addicted to a life of crime, had no time for the growin' stage
he learned his values on the streets at an early age
watch for po lice, dont come home cause mama's actin crazy at the hospital
bout' to have another baby, like the rose from the concrete
growin' within, blessed with twins,
how the hell can mama raise three men?
so we began, close as family, such insanity, a happy home
from one act of inhumanity, plus mama said the seed was currupted
used to rub her belly, beggin us to breath if she love us
now mama sites quiet, sippin' peppermint schnapps
turn the house into a spot and made her watch for cops
hey, how can mama bring a thug like me in this world?
she aint the cause of all the drama , cause mama's just a little girl
chorus
verse 3:
now, will she remains same spot?
the gunshots rain, they came from the 'cain spot
now, look her, i see her clutchin her son
in her arms you hurt, her heart bleed
now, she watch her seed die in the dirt
fullfilled prophecies, but who could stop the grief?
i walk around, tryin to hold the world up on top of me
i'll probably be an innocent man, still i'm a victim of a curse
what could be worse? nothin but pain since my birth
only fuctions at the pen, cause everybodies in
payin' back society, i'm gulity of a life of sin
i watch the drama occur, my eyes blurred
before i jet it, i wonder why we all have to die, before we get it
though, we shed tears, so many peers i done buried
worried and scared, knowin' imma see the cemetary
must be prepared in this cold world, no one cares
no it aint fair but we all bear and do our share
in this land of the underhanded schemes and plans
vivid dreams of a n**** havin' g's in hand
mama told be not to be a punk
f*** what you talking about, coward, what you n****z want? their aint a thing i woulnd't do for my mama in this world,
cause you know i aint mad at cha, your just a little girl
see mamas, just a little girl
outro :
they ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
they wonder why we hold such little worth for human life to ask us why we turn from bad to worse,
is to ignore from which we came
you see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged
petals
on the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity
we would all love its will to reach the sun
well, we are the roses, this is the concrete,
and these are my damaged petals.
don't ask me why. thank god, n****. ask me how."

verse 1 
somebody wake me i'm dreamin,
i started as a seed the semen
swimmin upstream, planted in the womb while screamin
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin stop
from a single drop, this is what they got
not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
only plan he had for momma was to f*** her and abuse her
even as a little seed, i could see his plan for me
stranded on welfare, another broken family
now what was i to be, a product of this heated passion
momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
look how it began, nobody gave a f*** about me
pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
how can i survive? got me askin white jesus
will a n**** live or die, cause the lord can't see us
in the deep, dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
no sunny days and we only play sometimes
when everybody's sleepin
i open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin
i can live or die, hope i get some money 'fore i'm gone
i'm only 19, i'm tryin to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody
and they pops tryin to slang rocks
i'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
you can buy rocks, glocks or a heroin bong
you can ask my man he's a mind reader
keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
meet up at the cemetary
then get smoked out, pass the weed n****
that hennessey'll keep me keyed n****
everywhere i go n****z holla at me, ""keep it real g""
and my reply til they kill me
act up if you feel me, i was born not to make it but i did
the tribulations of a ghetto kid, still i rise

i stay sharp as always

"in the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
i hope i die for a principle
or a belief that i had lived 4
i will die before my time
because i feel the shadow's depth
so much i wanted 2 accomplish
before i reached my death
i have come 2 grips with the possibility
and wiped the last tear from my eyes
i loved all who were positive
in the event of my demise"
"i exist in the dephts of solitude
pondering my true goal
trying 2 find peace of mind
and still preserve my soul
constantly yearning 2 be accepted
and from all receive respect
never compromising but sometimes risky
and that is my only regret
a young heart with an old soul
how can there be peace
how can i be in the dephts of solitude
when there r 2 inside of me
this duo within me causes
the perfect opportunity
2 learn and live twice as fast
as those who accept simplicity"
"did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
proving nature's laws wrong, it learned to walk without having feet
funny it seems, but by keeping it's dreams,
it learned to breathe fresh air.
long live the rose that grew from the concrete
when no one else even cared!"
"4 my hero 
when your hero falls from grace
all fairy tales are uncovered
myths exposed and pain magnified
the greatest pain discovered
you tought me to be strong
but i'm confused to see you so weak
you said never to give up
and it hurts to see you welcome defeat
when your hero falls so do the stars
and so does the perception of tomarrow
without my hero there is only
me alone to deal with my sorrow
your heart ceases to work
and your soul is not happy at all
what are you expected to do
when your only hero falls"

"death row
that's where motherf***ers is endin up
dear mama, i'm caught up in this sickness
i rob my adversaries, but slick done left a witness
wonder if they'll catch me, or will this n**** snitch
should i shoot his b****, or make the n**** rich?
don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
hawkin while i'm walkin, and talkin behind my back
i'm kind of schizophrenic, i'm in this shit to win it
cause life's a wheel of, fortune here's my chance to spin it
got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
too f***in trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
n****z gettin jealous  tryin to find my stash
whip out the nine, now i'ma dive and pump your ass
peter picked a pepper, but i can pick a punk
snatched him like a b****, and threw him in the trunk
the punk thought i was bluffin, but swear i'm nothin nice
before i take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
i listen to him scream, tray deee went insane
i guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
new rovers pull me over, i'm sentenced to the pen
remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
it's trouble on my mind, i'm with the old timers
and f*** five oh, blaow blaow.. turn em into forty niners
2pac singing 
bye bye, i was never meant to live
can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
bye bye, i was never meant to be
livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
bye bye, and i got no place to go...
where they find me? 16 on death row
dear mama, these cops don't understand me
i turned to a life of crime, cause i came from a broken family
my uncle used to touch me, i never told you that
scared what you might do, i couldn't hold you back
i kept it deep inside, i done let it fuel my anger
i'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
the brother in my set, is 16 is wet
it's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin hell
i shouldn'ta let him catch me
instead of livin sad in jail i coulda died free and happy
and my cellmate's raped on the norm
and passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin torn
they made me an animal
can't sleep, instead of countin sheep, n****z countin cannibals
and that's how it is in the pen
turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
my mama prayed for me
tell the lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me cause when they come for me they find a struggler
to the death i take the breath from your jugular
the trick is to never lose hope
i found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on death row
dear mama, they sentenced me to death
today's my final day, i'm countin every breath
i'm bitter cause i'm dyin, so much i haven't seen
i know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
i got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a shit
and they too quick to say goodbye to me
they tell me the preacher's there for me
he's a crook with a book, that motherf***er never cared for me
he's only here to be sure
i don't drop a dime to god bout the crimes he's commitin
on the poor, and how can these people judge me?
they ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
i never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
to keep a n**** in the state pen
and to my homies out buryin motherf***ers
steer clear of these aryan motherf***ers
cause once they got you locked up
they got you trapped, you're better off gettin shot
i'm convinced self defense is the way
please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
i wish i woulda known while i was out there
now i'm straight headin for the chair
16 on death row
it's to all my partners in the penetentiaries
16 on death row"

"postal border was makin' me mad
so i get up in my cruiser, broke out of the pad
rolled to the west side to check out my boys
twenty brothers in the park, all bringin' the noise
stepped out the car, levi's saggin'
gold around my neck with my limb walk laggin'
walked up on my boys with the old e chillin'
the box with the big beats and my boys started illin'
a hoop game started so i jump in
had the hoods' toughest team so i just had to win
diz to the outside, 2pac up the center
a ten minute game and we were the winners
the boys started smackin', talkin' that slack and
till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
tried to say we cheat, because he got beat
another lightweight sucker that can handle defeat
people wonder why i choose to live the hype
it's not to understand, it's just a day in the life
kick it   it's just a day in the life
finally i'm on vacation and school is through
so here i am, on monday mornin' with nothin' to do
tried to get outta my bed, but i can't move
ya see i'm stuck to my matress like crazy glue
so there i lay, for half the day just thinkin'
got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'
but i was all alone so it wasn't no thing
got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
picked it up, the salutations, little bit frustrations
who could be disturbin' me on my vacation?
speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
now i know what michael meant by leave me alone
so i'm askin' who is it? and the answer shocks me
it was the voice of my homeboy roc t
him and dizzy had been waitin' for me
had a show at three and now i'm late as can be
said i have to take a shower, i'll go ahead and take it
if i leave within the hour, i still might make it
i'm rollin' in a sweatsuit, wasn't tryin' to get cute
hopped on to the stage and said: ""sorry that i kept you""
i started rappin', girls started clappin'
couldn't wait to finish so i could start mackin'
jumped off stage, picked up the girl for the night
huh, that's how i'm livin', a day in the life, come on
a day in the life
stretch white limo hits the colessium
a crowd full of people sayin: ""i can't wait to see him""
who is in the limo, who are they talkin' about?
strictly dope in the house, hear to turn the party out
we get out the car and can barely stand
cause everywhere i look are screamin' fans
girls on my tip but i really don't sweat 'em
they'll tear my new clothes if your bodygurad'll let 'em
hit backstage with two minutes to spare
just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air
we hear the introduction, the audience is loud
i stepped out on the stage and then i moved the crowd
winners all over, we tried to leave the scene
but there's a whole crowd of people at the limousine
pen and paper in my face, i couldn't be mean
so i was signin' autographs at the age of seventeen
people wonder why i choose to live the hype
it's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life
kick it   it's a day in the life
kick it, kick it, kick it
coolin' with my posse at the neighborhood disco
talkin' to a cutie as i'm sippin' on my cisco
askin' me to dance but i keep on sayin' ""no""
hate to dance fast, i only like to do it slow
dizzy's on the dance floor, funky, funky motion
girl keeps on sweatin' me with sexual kind of totions
roc is signin' autographs makin' girlies dizzy
crowd sweatin' strictly dope cause we're gettin' busy
suckers wanna battle us, we move in silence
strictly dope is positive, we're tryin' to stop the violence
started feel tipsy, i'm lookin' for the door
the cisco had me dizzy, i stumbled to the floor
and more i try to sit up, the less i seem to get up
my stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit' up
the room begins to spin, i pass out for the night
just another way of livin' a day in the life, kick it
knew i was a genius, soon as you seen this
avoid hoe's value, don't have to redeem this
teenage terror, no room for error
a girl start dissin', and i scare her!!
risin' like inflation on your favorite station
rap is my forte and my recreation
girls wanna kiss me, suckers wanna diss me
my mother didn't want me to be, but i'ma emcee
the ladies desire, emcees admire
that's why many hate me and call me liar
hoods of the hype tip, girls on the ill trip
i'm through rockin' this whack, so that's it
i am the high type, my style is so right
it's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life"
"when your hero falls from grace, all fairy tales are uncovered
myth exposed and pain magnified, the greatest pain uncovered
you taught me to be strong, but i'm confused to see you so weak.
you say never to give up, and it hurts to see you welcome defeat.
when your hero falls so do the stars, and so does the pereception of tomorrow
without my hero, theres only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
what are you expected to do, when your only hero falls
as long as some suffer, the river flows forever
as long as there is pain, the river flows forever
as strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
and as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together..
..and as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
we'll ride.. the river together, as long as.. you are with me
the river.. will flow forever, as long as.. you are with me
the river.. will flow forever, as long as.. you are with me"

my attitude was 'f*** it' cause motherf***ers love it
to be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
though life is complicated, only what you make it be
uhh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
while she hot and horny, go up inside her
then i spit some game in her ear, 'go to the tele hoe'
you put what money in a benz, cause b**** i'm barely broke
i'm smokin bomb ass weed feelin crucial
from player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
from hustlin them bread, to breakin motherf***ers to payin

verse three: 2pac
my murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the thugs beforeme
pay off the block evade the cops cause i know they comin for me
i been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
now i'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
question my methods to switchin keys, sure as some b****esbleeds
n****z'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed

so now i'm back to be a motherf***in menace, they cowards
that's why they tried to set me up
had b**** ass n****z on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
but i'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
at the time i caught the perfect way that god made it
lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
for money, i'll have these mutherf***ers buried gettin much mail in jail, n****z tellin me to kill it
knowin when i get out, they gonna feel it
witness the realest, a whoridah when i put the shit inside

nightmares to humanity and morally disgraces but tomorrow, i see change a chance to build anew
tomorrow, i see change a chance to build anew

gnawin at my sanity, content when i am dropped

tomorrow, i see change 
but tomorrow, i see change
a chance to build anew
built on spirit, content of heart

n****z die and mommas cry
n****z got alibis and suicides and homicides
and three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
and n****z fame, as the world turns..
though i walk thru the valley of hell the shadow follows me
wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
you probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
and still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
i pray to black jesus to please take the rest of me
and still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
if we search deeper, god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
enemies get beside me, flows go deeper inside
we we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
time will soon show, a thought can last for years
outshinin them fakes smile plastic tears
like last year, n****z stuck in the past, and it's clear
just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year

now here's a story bout a woman with dreams
so picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
i could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
sheddin quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me,
""what would you do if it was you?""
couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
i tried to trade places in the tragedy
i couldn't picture three crazed n****z grabbin me
for just a moment i was trapped in the pain, lord come and takeme
four n****z violated, they chased and they raped me
even though it wasn't me, i could feel the grief
thinkin with your brains blown that would make the pain go

cause they win when your soul dies

"lookin for these better days
better days, heyyy! better days
got me thinkin bout better days
better days! better days, better days
heyyy! better days
got me thinkin bout better days
time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
smokin weed like it ain't no thang, so even kids
wanna try now, they lie down and get ran through
nobody watched 'em clockin the evil man do
faced with the demons, addicted to hearin victims screamin
guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
cause even our birthdays is cursed days
a born thug in the first place, the worst ways
i'd love to see the block in peace
with no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way
to stop the beast
and only we can change
it's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same
too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears
just seen another brother buried plus i knew him for years
passed by his family, but what could i say?
keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
and pray for better days
better days, better days, heyyy!
better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
better days, better days, better days
heyyy! better days
got me thinkin bout better days
thinkin back as an adolescent, who would've guessed
that in my future years, i'd be stressin
some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
plus my p.o. won't let me hang with the brothers i grew up with
tryin to keep my head up and stay strong
all my homies slangin yayo all day long,
but they wrong
so i'm solo and so broke
savin up for some jordan's, cause they dope
i got a girl and i love her but she broke too,
and so am i
i can't take her to the place she wanna go to
so we argue and play fight, all day and night
makin passionate love 'til the daylight
plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
tell me you pregnant and i'm amazed
so many blessings while we stressin
lookin for them better days
for better days, better days, better days, heyyy!
better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
better days, better days, better days
heyyy! better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
since back in high school, we was true, me and you
hardly parted or seperated, we stayed faded
affiliated with gangbangers and still made it
up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
still dressin like grown men when rollin
i went to dark, smokin newports, gamin marks
got a place in my heart, homey stay smart
locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
i send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
hopin you well, i know it's hell
doin time in the cells, you need mail, when you in jail
and me i'm doin cool
i settled down, had a family, workin in night school
every once in a while, i reminisce
and wonder how we ever came to this
i miss the better days
better days, better days, heyyy!
better days.. i'm thinkin bout better days
better days, better days, better days
heyyy! better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
i send this one out, to all the homeboys down in uh, clinton lockdown
rikers island, all them dudes i was uh locked up with, hehe
e block, f block, lower h

fat track gotcha sprung now your hung dum dum diddy is it me?
attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
if not peace then at least let's get a piece

lookin' through my highschool yearbook
reminiscin' of the tears as the years took

i'm workin' without a profit
they shacklin' all my homies
i'm hurtin' but keep the mind

certainly we survive with outlaw ridas
what's the reward for a strugala
if the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
runnin up, gun cocked like nasty gloves

young kadafi in this b****, set it off n****..

i do my shootin's on a knob, prayin to god for my squad
stuck in a nightmare, hopin he might care
though times is hard, up against all odds, i play my cards
like i'm jailin, shots hittin up my spot like midnight rains hailin
got me bailin to stacks more green; gods ain't tryin to be trapped
on no block slangin no rocks like bean pies
brainstorm on the beginnin
wonder how shit like the qu'ran and the bible was written
what is religion?
gods words all cursed like crack
shai tan's way of gettin us back
or just another one of my black jesus traps
who's got the heart to stand beside me?
i feel my enemies creepin up in silence
dark prayer, scream violence   demons all around me
can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; black jesus
give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
cause i swear, they tryin to break my well
i'm on the edge lookin down at this volatile pit
will it matter if i cease to exist? black jesus
all hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
in times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
black jesus, hahahahaha
he's like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
black jesus
outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
rebellin against the system, commence to lynchin
the president ain't even listenin to the pain of the youth
we make music for eternity, forever the truth
political prisoner, the two choices that they givin us
ride or die, for life they sentence us
oh black jesus, please watch over my brother shawn
soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
history repeats itself, nuttin new
in school i knew, e'rything i read wasn't true
black jesus
to this click i'm dedicated, criminal orientated
an outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
made for terror, major league n****z pray together
b****es in they grave while my real n****z play together

creamated, last wishes n**** smoke my ashes
high sigh why die wishin, hopin for possibilities
i'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily
cops patrol projects, hatin the people livin in them
i was born an inmate, waitin to escape the prison
went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
god gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous

where we, so used to hard times and casualties
indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
and haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
and all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums

makaveli:
tupac don't front that blasphemy in here. remember what my
poppa told me, remember what my poppa told me.
verse 1
my family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs, and killas, strugglin',
known to hustle screamin' f*** they villans. got advice from my father
all he told me was this, n**** get off your ass if you plan to be rich.
there's 10 rules to the game and i'll share with you 2. no n****'s
gonna hate you for whatever you do. now rule 1, get your cash on mob,
that's money over b****es cause they breath envy. now rule 2 it's a
hard one, watch for phonies, keep your enemies close n**** watch your
homies. it seemed a little unimportant, when he told me i smiled,
picture jewels being handed to an innocent child. i never knew in my
life time i'd live be these rules, inniated as an outlaw studying rules.
now papa ain't around so i gotta recall or come to grips with being
written on my enemies walls. promise if i have a seed, i'm gonna guide him
right, dear lord don't let me die tonight. i got words for my comrades,
listen and learn, ain't nothing free take back what you earned. gettin'
high than a muthaf***a, bless me please, this thug life be the death of
me, come on, and i remember what my papa told me, remember what my papa
told me. blasphemy!
chorus
verse 2
we probably in hell all ready our dumbass's not knowin', everybody
kissin' ass to go to heaven ain't goin'. put my soul on it, fightin'
devil n****'s daily, plus the media be crucifin' brotha's severely.
tell me i ain't god's son, n**** momma's a virgin. we got addicted had
to leave the bird's, back in the ghetto. doin' wild shit, lookin' at
the sun don't pay, criminal mind all the time wait for judgement day.
they say that moses split the red sea, i split the blunt & rolled a fat one
i'm deadly. babylon beware, comin' for the pharoah schemes.
retaliation makin' legends off the shit we did, still bull shitin',
n****'s in jerusalem waitin' for signs, god comin', shit, just take his
time. ha, ha. livin' bottom now, why the water flow? i'm
contemplatin' plots, wonderin' the thought to go. brotha's gettin' shot
comin' back ressurected, is this that raw shit, n**** chech it, and i
remember what my poppa told me, remember what my poppa told me.
blasphemy!
chorus
verse 3
the preacher want me buried, why? i know he a liar, have you ever seen
a crackhead? that's eternal fire. why you got these kids thinkin' that
they evil? while the preacher being freaky you say honor god's people.
should we cry when the pope die? my request, we should cry if they cried
when we buried malcom x. mama tell me am i wrong, is god just another
cop waitin' to beat my ass if i don't go pop. memories of a past time,
givin up cash to the leader's knowin' damn well they ain't gonna feed
us. in my brain how can i explain ?? it's hard enough to live now in
these times of grief. they say jesus is a kind man. well he should
understand times in this crime land. my thug nation. do what you gotta
do but know you gotta change, try to find a way out the game. i leave
this and hope god can see my heart as pure, is heaven just another door?
i leave this here, i leave this here and hope god can see my heart as
pure, is heaven just another door?"
"in today's music news: the ever controversial tupac shakur has
just released another album under the alias makaveli.
music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates, in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album;
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only mr. shakur, but of death row records as well.
nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at tupac
excuse me makaveli's verbal assault
on mobb sleep, notorius p.i.g., and several other new york rappers
jay z, from ""hawaiian sophie"" fame, big little whatever
and several other corny sounding motherf***ers
are understandably shaken up by this release.
the question everbody wants to know is   
why'd they get this n**** started?
tupac, rather makaveli, was not available for comment
but released this statement:
it's not about east or west
it's about n****z and b****es, power and money,
riders and punks. which side are you on?
these n****z is still f***in talkin?
you n****z still breathin? f***in roaches, aight
aight, it's the raid for your cockroaches
it's the raid for you punk motherf***ers

hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the holy qu'ran

expose snakes cause they breath freely, see me ride?
located world wide like the art of graffiti

cut 'em down.. to hell is where we send 'em
my whole team, trained to explode ride or die
murder motherf***ers lyrically, and i'm not gon' cry

"brenda's got a baby
brenda's got a baby
i hear brenda's got a baby
well, brenda's barely got a brain
a damn shame
tha girl can hardly spell her name
well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a junky
went in debt to his arms, it's sad
cause i bet brenda doesn't even know
just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
but oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came they got first dibs
now brenda's belly is gettin bigger
but no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
she's 12 years old and she's having a baby
in love with tha molester, who's sexing her crazy
and yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together, whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha bathroom floor
and didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and what ta keep
she wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
i guess she thought she'd get away
wouldn't hear tha cries
she didn't realize
how much tha tha little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away
momma say, you makin' me lose pay,
tha social workers here everyday
now brenda's gotta make her own way
can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
no money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
she tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
so now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
it's payin tha rent, so she really can't complain
prostitute, found slain, and brenda's her name,
she's got a baby
baaaaaaaaby"
"perhaps i was addicted to the dark side
somewhere inside my childhood i missed my heart die
and even though we both came from the same places
the money and the fame made us all change places
how could it be through the misery that came to pass
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for currency
but you could run to me when you need me, i'll never leave
i just needed someone to believe in, as you can see
it's a small thang through and true
what could i do? real homies help ya get through,
and coming new, he'd do tha same thang if he could
cuz in the hood true homies make you feel good
and half the time we be acting up call tha cops
bringing the cease to tha peace that was on my block
it never stop, when my mama ask me will i change
i tell her yeah, but it's clear i'll always be tha same
until the end of time
so take, these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
so i can fly away, until the end of time
until the end of time
until the end of time
please lord forgive me for my life of sin
my hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
so you know i don't hang around tha house much
this all night money making got me outta touch, shit
ain't flashed a smile in a long while
an unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
my attitude got me walking solo
ride out alone in my low low
watching the whole world move in slow mo
for quiet times disappear listen to the ocean
smoking ports think my thoughts
then it's back to coasting
who can i trust in this cold world
my phony homey had a baby by my own girl
but i ain't trippin i'm a player i ain't sweating him
i sex his sister, had her mo' good like a mexican
his next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen
besides rapping the only thing i did good was scrapping
until the end of time
now who's to say if i was right or wrong?
to live my life as an outlaw all along
remain strong in this planet full of playa haters
they conversate but death row full of demonstrators
and in tha end drinking henessy made all my enemies envy me
so cold when i flow eliminating easily
fall to their knees, they plead for their right to breath
while beggin me to keep the peace well i can see close into achieve
in times of danger don't freeze time to be a g
follow my lead i supply everything you need
an ounce of game and the trainin to make a g
remember me, as an outcast outlaw
another album out that's what i'm about, more
gettin raw till the day i see my casket
buried as a g while tha whole world remembers me
until the end of time"

so they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
cause they all broke an' why do ghetto birds die?
before we learn to fly, somebody else's child caught in guns
smokin' weed can all make a change
so i'm told but i haven't seen the change unfold
i keep hopin' please, if you prefer to breathe
communities in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open now, can only say i'll try
until the day i die

waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away.
now mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet.
so now a young n****s bein' raised by the streets.
and then the on other one that ever showed me love

living in the ghetto.
from the cradle to the grave, i'm glad to say

and all they got was their name here up on a wall.
it's sad thinkin' about the times
life goes on, i'm steady lost in this land...
as the warzone i got no home
don't have no friends neither.
it's just me by my lonely so i married my nina.
i keeps her wherever i go,
i love my ho.
never leave home with out my sugar.
i'm hafta plug a n****.
mama told me not to trust no punks,
and kick his ass if he lay a hand on me.
since then i been known.
sometimes i think my own self stupid
cause i stay shootin' at marks,
get twisted up in police reports.
since the cradle, i've been ungreatful.
my first toy was a gun
i got sprung and learn to love weapons.
but now i'm through with money
and through with street fame.
somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave.
chorus
from the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
living in the ghetto.

march 18th
a rainy day my mama gave birth
to a baby boy trapped in hell on earth.
from day one it wasn't fun i never had a crumb.
daddy worked two jobs and mama won't stop drinkin' rum.
i tried to cope loc
but my family's broke
and my pocket's short
so now i gotta sling dope.
in a game filled with pain it's a f***in' shame,
the white man got a motha f***a slingin' cane.
so now it's on from dusk to dawn i get my serve on.
always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks.
shit don't stop i'm steady dodgin' cops.
i never flip flop
hear my glock cock
thug till i drop.
and if i hit the pen i gotta do my time
sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times.

but from the cradle to the grave i'ma put in work.

so i pray and i lay with my a k.
did i sell my soul as a young kid?
all the things i did
wishin' someone held me
but they never did.
i can't take it
will i make it to my older age?
before i'm shot up or locked up in a f***in' cage.
lord help me, guide me, save me!
cause that's the way that daddy raised me
crazy.
do or die. n**** pull the trigger don't give a f***.
you'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked.
nobody cares, it's me against the world.
keepin' murder on my mind and my tech 9.
i got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, n**** you wanna die?
i get high
then my mission is a walk by.
you'd better jet when i hit your set cause i'm comin'.
start runnin' yellin' ""evil mind"" as i'm gunnin'.

for the mothers that cried, for my homies that died.

only thing i'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
let me tell how you rough i get
i pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
you can't get in because my gate's bigger i'ma snake n****
my act guards me so hard i pull the f***in trigger
i'm a section to clinch your porch is like a pinch
test a rhyme i'll knock your hairline back an inch
f***in up pooh butts, cut em like cold cuts
choke em with my boot lace, then leave em hangin like old nuts
clip up and move out, time to get em"
"death row
that's where motherf***ers is endin up
dear mama, i'm caught up in this sickness
i robbed my adversaries, but slipped and left a witness
wonder if they'll catch me, or will this ***** snitch
should i shoot his *****, or make the ***** rich?
don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
hawkin while i'm walkin, and talkin behind my back
i'm kind of schizophrenic, i'm in this **** to win it
cause life's a wheel of, fortune here's my chance to spin it
got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
too f***in trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
n****z gettin jealous  tryin to find my stash
whip out the nine, now i'ma dive and pump your ass
peter picked a pepper, but i can pick a punk
snatched him like a *****, and threw him in the trunk
the punk thought i was bluffin, but swear i'm nothin nice
before i take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
i listen to him scream, tray deee went insane
i guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
new rovers pull me over, i'm sentenced to the pen
remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
it's trouble on my mind, i'm with the old timers
and **** five oh, blaow blaow.. turn em into forty niners
 
and when i’m gone, just carry on don’t mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice,
just know that i’m lookin’ down on you smilin,
and i didn’t feel a thing so baby don’t feel no pain, just smile back!
dear mama, these cops don't understand me
i turned to a life of crime, cause i came from a broken family
my uncle used to touch me, i never told you that
scared what you might do, i couldn't hold you back
i kept it deep inside, i done let it fuel my anger
i'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
the brother in my cell, is 16 as well
it's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin hell
i shouldn'ta let him catch me
instead of livin sad in jail i coulda died free and happy
and my cellmate's raped on the norm
and passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin torn
they made me an animal
can't sleep, instead of countin sheep, n****z countin cannibals
and that's how it is in the pen
turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
my mama prayed for me
tell the lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me cause when they come for me they find a struggler
to the death i take the breath from your jugular
the trick is to never lose hope
i found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on death row
 
and when i’m gone, just carry on don’t mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice,
just know that i’m lookin’ down on you smilin,
and i didn’t feel a thing so baby don’t feel no pain, just smile back!
dear mama, they sentenced me to death
today's my final day, i'm countin every breath
i'm bitter cause i'm dyin, so much i haven't seen
i know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
i got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a ****
and they too quick to say goodbye to me
they tell me the preacher's there for me
he's a crook with a book, that ************ never cared for me
he's only here to be sure
i don't drop a dime to god bout the crimes he's commitin
on the poor, and how can these people judge me?
they ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
i never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
to keep a ***** in the state pen
and to my homies out buryin motherf***ers
steer clear of these aryan motherf***ers
cause once they got you locked up
they got you trapped, you're better off gettin shot up
i'm convinced self defense is the way
please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
i wish i woulda known while i was out there
now i'm straight headin for the chair
 
and when i’m gone, just carry on don’t mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice,
just know that i’m lookin’ down on you smilin,
and i didn’t feel a thing so baby don’t feel no pain, just smile back!"
"child: why you by the window?, what's wrong daddy?
mother: i know what's wrong with that crazy motherf***er
he's just stand by the goddamn window
with that f***in' ak all day
you don't work, you don't f***, you don't,
you don't do a goddamn thing
i see death around the corner, gotta stay high while i survive
in the city where the skinny n****s die
if they bury me, bury me as a g n****, no need to worry
i expect retaliation in a hurry
i see death around the  corner, anyday
trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
strugglin and strivin, my destiny's to die
keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
in a ball of confusion, i think about my daddy
madder than a motherf***er, they never shoulda had me
i guess i seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
am i paranoid?   tell me the truth
i'm out the window with my ak, ready to shoot
ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
i'm out of breath
make me wanna kill my damn self,
but i see death around the corner
chorus
i see death around the corner
i see death around the corner
i see death around the corner
i see death around the corner,
the pressure's getting to me
i no longer trust my homies,
them phonies tried to do me
smoking too much weed,
got me paranoid, stressed
pack a gat and my vest,
under my clothes when i dress
here's hopin i die the way i lived,
straight thuggin'
huggin' my trigger for all them n****s
who was buggin'
my homie told me once,
don't you trust them other suckers
they fought like they your homies
but they phony motherf***ers
and even if i did die young, who cares
all i ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
i got homies in my head
who done passed away screamin, please
young n****, make gs
i can't give up, although i'm hopeless,
i think my mind's gone
all i can do is get my grind on, death around the corner
chorus
i was raised in the city, shitty
ever since i was an itty bitty kitty
drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
and smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
and drinking liquor til' you out cold
and tho' i'm gone now, n**** it's still on  pow
bustin on them n****s til they gone
how many more jealous ass b****es, comin for my riches
now i gotta stay suspicious when i bone
cause if i ain't sharp and heartless,
them b****es will start shit
excuse me, but this is where we part b****
no more game for free, please explain to me
why n****s trip b****, who you came to see?
murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
i got homies that will hunt you til you drop
i hope the lord will forgive me, i was a g
and gettin high was a way of gettin free
i see death around the corner
chorus
this is for all the real mothaf***in n****s out there
i know you ain't scared to die
we all gotta go, ya know ?
a real motherf***er will pick the time he goes
and make sure he handles his motherf***in business
y'all n****s stop acting like pussies out there,
all right
i'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that
i want his family dead, i want his house burned to the ground
i want to got there in the middle of the night,
i wanna piss on his head
i want his family dead, i want his house burned to the ground
i want to got there in the middle of the night,
i wanna piss on his head
i want that sonova b**** dead, i want him dead
i want him dead, i don't care"

"i ain't got time for this man i'm out
you should stop for awhile you will find me standing by over here at the side of your life you spend all your hours just rushing around
do you have a little time to have a little time for me?
as soon as i leave the house you wanna page me
see you got me trapped i'm going crazy this is slavery
you act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
and maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
soon as i come home it's like i get the third degree
where ya been and who you with i get no room to breathe it makes me wanna leave
i'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
your suspicious i decieve give me grief without belief but to me
if you really trust me then it's pitiful
question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
let me live my life and you can live yours
just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
not to give me stress and add to pressure
home is where i go the rest i go to pass the test
i'm sorry if i left you all alone
but i couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone
don't you trust me?
callin' up my house to hang it up you think that makes sense
tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
it's time for us to take our seperate paths
we had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
let's think of the evil break don't make it scandoulous
try to be mature i'm pretty sure that we can handle this
your sayin i'm too busy i ignore you
i guess you didn't hear me when i said that i cared for you
but now it seems the arguments are nightly
i wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
so why let it stress and aggravate me
instead i'd rather break hope you don't hate me
you tell me that you love me but your lyin'
fightin back the urge to start cryin'
i wipe away your tears come and hug me
i love you like you love me
girl...don't you trust me?
i hangup the phone i can't bare to hear you yellin' at me
maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
you know that i'm emotional you milk me
comin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty
you and me were met to be it yet
you always wanna sweat and how much closer can we get just set me back my things and i'll be outie
this time i'm breakin out you let your mouth overcrowd me
i can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
i get no room to sleep i hope it ceases cause i'm leavin'
maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
when i can give you more when you unsure
but baby until then i gotta leave ya
it's not that i don't need ya but see ya
and i hope that you understand why i bust it
not becuase we rushed it but girl don't you trust me?
not that i don't trust you
don't you trust me?
not that i don't trust you
don't you trust me?
not that i don't trust you"
"late night coolin' with my homies drinkin' hennessey and cold brew
after smokin', stopped in oakland got the munchies for some soul food
so we stopped to get a bite to eat at the local bar b q
it's just another boring monday and theres nothing else to do
now as we stepped out of the car i heard someone behind me fighting
so i turn to look and find out whats the cause of this excitement
the brother was a dope fiend and the other was a dope man
and the dope man had an ak said he'll spray and he's not jokin'
well it seems to be the dope fiend owed the dope man for his product
and he swore if he did not pay he would end up getting shot up
now i could not walk away cause i got caught up in the scene
wondering what would happen to this poor and helpless fiend
well my homie, michael cooley said let's go and make our order
what's the use in watchin two men stand out here fight over quarters
while i walked inside the diner and all the dope fiends waived to me
heard the sound of several gun shots and i ran outside to see... 
another gun shot rings another siren sings another mother cries cause another innocent died 
another gun shot rings another siren sings another mother cries cause another innocent died
all the people in the diner ran outside to see the big show
it was just another party for them to see just who they would know
but for me a held concern i wanted to see the outcome
would the mother see her son tonight or would she live her live without one
i made it to the streets i almost cried right on the spot
not only had the fiend died but a small girl had been shot
my heart could not take no more i felt a tear roll down my face
that was daddy's bullet but she took it in his place
tried to make my way to the crowd so i could go help the baby
she could barely speak but she was  mister could you please save me
so i screamed out someone help me but i dont think they could hear
and if they did they didnt care oh how i hated everyone there
the baby lied here dying and i wondered what could i do
the camera men and newspapers had come to get their entidies
to them its just a story and they cant see the tradgety
to them it doesn't matter cause it aint it wasnt their family
i dont think ill be back cause itll never be the same here
so i wipe away the tears and leave the scene the way i came here
those people say its crazy and the poor could have been finer
ill never forget the night at dopefiends diner
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, etc."

westside, death row, outlaw, ridaz,
untouchable mob of pistol packers,
well known felons labeled for 'drug selling merciless jackers',
forever buzz, roll with thugs and dogs,
commence the letting off rounds, then escape in the fog,
who wants to see me solo?
catch makaveli while he sleeping,
my mini fourteen murdering n****z while they creepin, duck cause you ass out,
drink 'til you pass out,
ain't scared to die, drunk driving in my glass house,

young nation, no revolution and no cause,
one nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
young nation just trying to get this
when it's on, i'm poppin' off every chance i get,
out the window on some uptown anthem shit,
i'm stressin', but ain't no pressure, i been here before,
fugitive taskforce at my girlfriends' door,
now they checkin' in her bedroom, i ain't there,
forty cals, extended clips, still i ain't scared,
outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive,
i'm different and i'mma prove it if it take me to die,
you think god had a plan for me?
but he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me,
maybe i'm brazen or paranoid than a b****,
me dyin', you think i'd let him see the joy from that shit?
walking dead, angels spend their last days by me,
new jersey giant like dave tyree,
young george or jonathan chat,
your guns clap,
mine will go 'br r r r att',
soldier like geronimo pratt,
and come through cockin' tha black pound,
when they put the twin towers up, pac, i'm knockin' 'em back down,
poster child,
air force ones, with the checks,
i'm supposed to wild sex,
money and murder is all i breathe in my life,
it's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night,
through the henny, i see the eyes of the devil,
he's ridin' with extra boxes of bullets and a nina and a shovel
who you are,
one nation under a thug and bullet scar,
young nation, no revolution and no cause,
one nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
young nation just trying to get this
i always thought i'd have to die to do a record with pac,
so i wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box,
you end up in the box 'cause them grave robbin' bastards,
dig your grave up and snatched you out the casket,
worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage,
the flesh to the bones,
the bones to the ashes,
but i'm not dead,
i'm actually in a session with the pac keeper, sha money, progressing,
they don't really want no drama, i know they goons,
that's why i keep pressure on 'em like a open wound,
this god given, he keep givin' me better music,
so every time you hear me, my songs present improvement,
y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin',
songs of evolution,
if i load your gun for you and we bang it out with some other n****s, you better shoot it,
don't try to lie and say you was bustin', i'm clever, stupid,
claimin' you reppin' ruthless,
you got the same bullets you had when i loaded it for you, you never used it,
the nasareema dream, get ready for execution,
papoose, fatal and pac
the revolution
who you are,
one nation under a thug and bullet scar,
young nation, no revolution and no cause,
one nation, young, black and dangerous by far,
young nation just trying to get this

say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
penitentiary d***, the trot caught your eye
when i walked by, i said, ""hi""
but you was so shy, i can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
you want me to lick it and even worse
got your heart set on me goin first, and that ain't no fair exchange
you do me
and if it's worth it baby i'll return the favor
and give it back to you
a fair exchange, on everythang
let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
open your eyes baby, recognize a player
give it up to me a fair exchange, you know the game
we can do the damn thang, thang, thang
open your legs
got me watchin like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin
look up, cause i got mirrors on the ceiling
and if you willin, then we can ride until the sun shine
and just for fun, i betchu i can make you cum sixty one times
close your eyes, let me heat it up
cause when we f*** i refuse to bust a nut until i beat it up
drop the top, time to f*** while the wind blow
baby throw yo' legs out the window
remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
and let me hit it where it counts and flee
remember me? ""i get around,"" and i'm haunted by my temptations
sexual participation, my motivation
even though i like the way you work it
you don't deserve it cause you walk around actin like you perfect
took a while but i finally got it, and like a boss player
b**** you ain't doin me no favors, fair exchange
now yo' attitude ain't realistic
yeah it's true i'm gettin p****, but baby you gettin d***!
and since you bein laced with the penetration
it's only right to show a form of appreciation
instead of fakin like you can't hear the bed shakin
in bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin
you said take it so i'm blind in my passion, how long will i last?
doggie style steady pumpin on that ass, until i blast
and then i laugh as we lay back
see i wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
cause you actin like you did somethin, givin me a piece
i had you mufflin your screams in the sheets, f***in with me
a true digger that love triggers, a thug n****
hustlin b****es like drug dealers
before i say goodbye, put an end to all the games
here's my number for another fair exchange
   repeat 2x"
"turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what
turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what 
pack your cannons we outlandishly brandish the weapons
meet jamaican like you god  and 'em handing you lessons
we learn a lot from the 60's like glaring 13 necks
mainly the n****z get shot for flaring out their larynx
and get to speakin' on a conditions of black people
that's illegal they enforce it with the force that's lethal
make you wanna grab a gun and throw the all black gear on
head to congress exercising your constitutional right to bear arms
leather jackets and glasses and you can tell it's us
the fbi probably bust a nut if we self destruct
call it militant but ain't nobody killing barry you can't be militant if you ain't got no military
but it's still a very powerful word
picture some n****z with guns, got 'em very disturbed, word
now a days you could get shot for a cheap necklace
back then my people bust shots for the free breakfast
now before you see god, or stand before allah
you could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
everybody act hard, like they got no regard
so we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard
this is for medgar evers, martin, and my brother malcom
sometimes we be sittin and wishing for another outcome
my head be spinning, it be full of why's and the how come's
the value of life is so cheap if your skin ain't talcum
we need leaders, we looking at entertainers
it's about the cash, so we respect the biggest gainers
n****z get paid then they run away from the community
that ain't gangsta n****, you the opposite of huey p
don't be confusing me with haters, player
get your paper, just show respect to the folks who made you blessed by the creator so give money n****
just don't bring a plate of food around a hungry n****
out on these streets the police is killing
i'm spilling out my heart on these beats so i can feed my children disrespect and i'm a give you a bar to save your life
because we don't need no more fallen stars
stalk the stage with the pride of the panther
hands off asada and the blood of a dance floor
word, rock on, throw the tupac on
he's not gone, you hear his influence in pop songs
shine brighter than those vegas lights
illuminating that vegas night to the party after the fight
'til the gunshots disturb the peace like luda
too bad he ain't a white chick in aruba
they'd have a whole department dedicated to finding the killer
you'd see afeni shakur on larry king, and motherf***ing dennis miller
word, bill o'reilly would be flapping his gums
how much respect do they have for my people?
actually none
you either do the n**** packing a gun who hate n****z
even though every time he pass a mirror he staring at one
my man stressed 'cause of lack of funds
this the type of shit that make you wanna drown your liver
and blacken your lungs
 x3
now of course this was inspired by tupac shakur
eazy e, still here my man justo big l big pun i'm from brooklyn, you know what i'm saying
brooklyn know a lot about tragedy
we lost our big poppa and our baby girl
that was our whole world, yo this is for our fallen stars
inspired by the poets, revolutionaries, and activists
from the generation before us
come and do our thing on this microphone
when else in the history of this country
can a black man get on the microphone
and say whatever the hell he wanna say?
it's a lot of responsibility
but we standing on the shoulders of our ancestors
so i bear that burden, throw it on my back"
"and my n****s say
we want the fame
c'mon c'mon
one thing we all adore
something worth dying for
nothing but pain
stuck in this game
searching for fortune and fame
the one thing we all adore
something worth dying for
it's been nothing but pain
stuck in this game
searching for fortune and fame
though we exist and breathe
some believe currency comes to g's
stresses half the ghetto
with success comes greed they got me hot
when they shot me
plotted
my revenge
to increase my ends
enemies gettin dropped
win or lose
red or blue
we must all stay true
play the game n****
never let the game play you
and for the fame n****s change fast that's a shame what's the game
lost souls
who controls our brain?
who can i blame? the world seems strange at times
somewhat insane i'm hoping we can change with time
i'm living blinded searching for a violent curse
i know death follows me
but i murder him first
and worse yet
with each breathe
steps i take
breathless
is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
cigar ashes
coaster
crystal glasses
we mash on them jealous bastards
with a ski mask
i'm the first one to warn them
blast it
wrapped in plastic
bullshitting got his ass hit ain't nothing left now
treated like a stepchild
was not for me
nothing but busters and b****es be rocking beats
fake in fame
block run and shoot slugs
we throw them back like hardballs
without the gloves
no love for these fake desperados
and thugs i bleed to envy
smoke and blow out they blunts
sipping henney
drunk nights
and hot days
cocking my heat
shooting it sideways
a wife on the run
full of common blunts
unconditionally married
to my gun
fulfillin' my destiny
on knees
and ones desires
be pulling all my cabbage
like priors
stuck in the trance
searching for something higher
fortune and fame
one thing we all adore
something worth dying for
nothing but pain
stuck in this game
searching for fortune and fame 
the one thing we all adore
something worth dying for
it's been nothing but pain
stuck in this game
searching for fortune and fame
searching for fortune and fame
lost in the rain
a lose of the game
with life the cost of the game
we forcing the change
mother f*** flossing the chain all the blame
belongs to the part of the brain that we never use n****
plus my heart is in pain and if i ever lose homey
bet i'm at it again outlaws don't die
so united we stand and if family 'come a foe
all the fortune and fame 
as i walk up in the crib
laid to rest me head
say some rhymes to angels
hope they bless my bed
hope they bless me the righteous way
got a homie locked down
outta town
i sent him a kite today
man that hate in your heart
your gotta cleanse it dog
praying for my downfall
and i can sense it dog
i was passed down the street fame
like glocks clocked
and keep aim
was raised up with a clock box
and i ran with the local street gang
they say the light is faded
but still shine in the dark
you can easy been a man
but you is a boy in your heart
and that's some game that i got
from generation of game
in the road of life dog
we need to switch up lanes
think about it
one thing we all adore
something worth dying for
nothing but pain
stuck in this game
searching for fortune and fame 
the one thing we all adore
something worth dying for
it's been nothing but pain
stuck in this game
searching for fortune and fame
i can't complain
i've seen my fair share of the fame
it wont change me
now i've got this piece of change
i feel strange
i got so use to the hood
that when i finally got out
at first it ain't feel good
i was just a baby
still r*****ed from slavery
when we struggle to shovel shit
ain't nobody saved me
ghetto ain't made me
i made myself
poverty raised me
thinking ain't no help
i pray for my health
my mind
and my family too
state of myself
my grind
and my family crew
where one hand watches the other
no we ain't blood
but we still real brothers
the struggle is real
nothing can steal
what we build
and that remains the same
'till that day we killed
and that's real
life that i was aimed to be
love by my family tree
that's fame to me
how about it
one thing we all adore
something worth dying for
nothing but pain
stuck in this game
searching for fortune and fame
the one thing we all adore
something worth dying for
nothing but pain
stuck in this game
searching for fortune and fame"
"because we all spring from different trees
does not mean we are not created equally
is the true beauty in the tree
or in the vast forest in which it breathes?
i find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds

because we all spring from different trees
does not mean we are not created equally

drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring...

shakin' the dice, now roll 'em,
if you can't stand pain better hold 'em.
cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.
you might fold catch aids from a slight cold.
better live your life to the fullest,
be quick to kill a fool, got a pistol mothaf***a better pull it.
and even when they kill me,
they can never take the life of a young g."

and let it rein thro your brain
street smart
efficient
intelligent
and keep suckers hitten 'till snitches start smelling me
moving n****s with telekinesis
keeping channel 7 at work filming different features
beating n****s to an early death with their head blown
and to those who didn't make it to the morgue
was just dead and gone
and hope n****s got punished
kidnapped jacked in the back with macks to they lap rats waiting to get done
we tossed his ass out
mob related
one more n**** found shot up with his d*** in his mouth
printed my name in tha streets as a motherf***ing g
now the next generations looking up to me
walking through the cemetery talking to my homies that was buried
see my enemies wanna see me dead i ain't worried
forgive me
please give me shelter for all my fears
lifted my head from my hands had a palm of tears
i see bodies gettin splashed with acid
two shots rang from the plastic glock
wrapped in plastic

torn ligaments all up in that n****s shoulder
and a vest couldn't protect that flesh
cause i got slugs to knock the air outta your chest

living my life as a ghetto star
f*** them ..."
"the only way for me to come back is by makaveli
that's me
all these motherf***ers stole from me
i'm takin' back what's mine
hahaha
you motherf***ers can't stop me
even if i die i'm gonna be a f***in' problem
do you believe in ghosts, motherf***er?
real live, black... ghosts
fear me
some say i'm crazy, these punk ass cops can't fade me
momma tried to raise me, but had too many babies
papa was a motherf***in' joke, used to find dope in his coat
and nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
damn, don't get me started
my momma smoked so goddamn much when she was pregnant
i'm surprised i ain't r*****ed
at night i can't sleep, count ?
as they pass through the glass of my neighbors, five deep
starin' at the wall, heard a scream
wake up in the morning, see the blood in the hall from the murder scene
don't cry, just ask why
and try not to die as i take you through a ghetto n****'s lullaby
on the corner where the n****s sling they crack
and the undercovers jack, those that don't watch they back
i daydream about the dope world
take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
my mossberg goes once another plug
snatchin' drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs don't run out of breath, every step could be death
til ya blast and be the last n**** left 
don't cry, just ask why
and try not to die as i take you through a ghetto n****'s lullaby
a seven deuce full of n****s goes by
thought i was trippin' the second time they roll by
recognize the plates, the faces look familiar
but everybody swear they know the n**** that's gonna kill ya
don't murder me, murder me, kill a n**** in his sleep
let me die as i rest in peace, deep
back to these n****s in the seven deuce
a mac 10 out the window, 'bout to let it loose
what could i do? run for cover and return fire
die motherf***er die, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
but i let off everything i had
an empty clip hit the ground as a n**** dash
on my ass was the motherf***in' cops now
barely breathin', trying to keep from gettin' shot down
*boo cow* was the sound, bullet whiz by
still runnin' like a n**** got nine lives
don't know why, but i'm runnin' to my f***in' block
took a shot, tired of runnin' from the n****s and the cops
time to be a ghost
don't cry, just ask why
and try not to die as i take you through a ghetto n****'s lullaby
f*** the police, n****!"
"god
when i was alone, and had nothing
i asked for a friend to help me bear the pain
no one came, except god
when i needed a breath to rise, from my sleep
no one could help me.. except god
when all i saw was sadness, and i needed answers
no one heard me, except god
so when i'm asked.. who i give my unconditional love to?
i look for no other name, except god"

"i was so money orientated initiated as a thug

just a n**** or a killer i don't know, so
who makes the call?
will i fall a victim like the rest?
slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure i'm gone
send me home all alone in these cold streets
the desperation, constantly drinking and i can't sleep
make deep tryin' to survive, some wanna die i wanna stay alive
eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region

after living so loftly

but it's the fast lane on that, big dealing, big sinnin', all for the money

most ain't even real but we still call them homies

outlaw never surrender is the call when the day is comin'
but this n**** get to running for my click get to gunnin
str8 in the mist of all this stress and pain
we're trying to get a hold of the game
living that good life
 4x"
"today we're gonna do something scary
we're venturing into the mind of young black males
let's take a peak...
cuddies perved by the corner, stout, herb
got me twisted, mo' cold killin murders
them brothers gettin further
got my pencil for utensil, this'll keep they mind knownin
spot some thugs at the club, and they got the nines showin
dirty pimpin g's, one of my dreams, player now listen
lotta blacks locked down, but comin back around in '96
all the gals my six  my track crew and my mother
make these police wonder: how is he so undercover?
never been a lover, but america had broke my heart
i was told to tear up out this before this tear me apart
eat through scrap, black tracks, free milk and cheese
while the japs stack scratch with the vietnamese
but i'm finna squeeze, stack cheese they left on a trap
a young playa mack, hit the bud', spit a rap
it's just that feelin, that feelin that i have for children
are able to love us, but these crazy devils try to kill us
""i gotta survive, i try to stay alive, ho""
""smokin that dank to deal with the pain""
june 2nd '93 i returned to the streets
did 2 months in the county and i opt to the beat
now the cops keep watch, cause they know that i rap
tell the world that i'm a gangsta, cause i ride with a strap
but i ain't yo gangsta, just a young n**** caught up in the struggle
born hustler, goin for the jugular
out to take the beast down, piece down might be too late
the funk is on, high, drunk off thunderbird and grape kool aid
would love to catch a playa slippin, take me down and book me
guilty as charged, hit the switch and try to cook me
silence a n**** for the shit i'm spittin, i know i'm scarin ya
a poison you created in the veins of america
miseducated, incarcerated, institutionalized
that 3rd strike will have a gang of them rollers dyin
ain't no love where i'm goin, no love where i'm comin from
remember me, that real ass n**** you been runnin from
got us sprung off the cocaine and the welfare
while the black babies die without health care
now how could i pledge allegiance to a racist ass flag
when the rollers at my do' with a .44 mag?
got my mother spittin drag 'bout i ain't home
got a double homicide warrant on my dome
i hear em pushin in the do', i grab my mac with two clips
cut through the back window and like a g hit a fence
i'm thinkin 'bout my folks gettin sent for violation
foes and punk police, them devils still at my do'
i peep a group of ten tryina get information
i threw the clips in the mac, start lettin off frustration
it's better than incarceration any day, we gonn' die anyway
so if i go out blastin, call it my fate
i got n****s in the pen like my cousin bud
lunatic insane, and my partner t love
big tom, ray ray, killa cuddy, mac dre
cleek, jamal, jinx and bluebonic, man
now i been called a crook, a killer, a thug
a no good dealer of drugs
and blood or cuz, doesn't matter what set you was
cause where i'm at, if you black, we strapped
as long as ki's make g's these thieves attack
and ain't no rules on the streets these days
muthaf***as better watch they back and take it eazay
i'm livin in the dangerzone
and learnin lesson from the game, it's on
n****s was gone when the frame was on
i'm gettin breaken them balls daily
is there a ghetto in heaven or do i go to hell?
see, seems i was senteced to death, takin my steps with my head down
why pour i liquor for my n****s, cause they dead now
my memory since i was a little seed
was a penitentiary full of n****s like me
these cops can't terrorize us, they despise us
n****s, cause we on the rise
plus everybody's searchin for a piece of the truth
and the youth turn the streets into a piece of beirut
and the truth is
""i gotta survive, i try to stay alive, ho""
""smokin that dank to deal with the pain"""
"you find an mc like me who's strong
we leavin' muthaf***a's aborted
with no verbal support
when i command the microphone
i gets deadly as congo
with a bear and a snake and a panda, i'm on thou
who can we stand, the more power of game
and make it possible for me to drop
a few to wrecks ya brain
imagine to keep on wishin' upon a star
finally realizing who the f*** you are
when i penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded,
would it be the greatest mc of all time
when i created rhyme for the simple fact
when i attack the  be tired
my attempts to ride
every time all night
i faced with the scars beyond
this beam or bar
for me to put down my guard
i'm faced with it, i'm a ride
breakin' in gas with the six eight all day
in an out, with my pay
i'm soon to count the bodies...
so mandatory my elevation
my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar
with tha n**** you facin'
we must be based on nothin'
better than communication
known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin'
no more procrastination
give up to fate, and get that ass shakin'
i'm bustin' and makin muthaf***a's panic
don't take ya life for granted
put that ass in the dirt
you swear the b**** was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet
it's similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out, forgive me janet
who's in control i'm acvtivatin yo souls
you know, the way the games get told
yo two years ago, a friend of mine
told me alazhay and chrystal
blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest f***in' rhyme i wrote
takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat
i got my mind made up, come on... get in get in too let it ride tonight's tha night
i got my mind made up, come on...
get in get in too
let it ride
tonight's tha night
well i comes through with two packs
of tha bomb pro folax
for protection
so my f***in sac won't collapse
cause nowadays, shits evading the x rays
sending young muthaf***a's to an early grave
i wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing mc's
shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
electryfing like thunder
i'm just too much
rough and raw with that mutha f***in' poisonous touch
i'm a
mc with lyrics that's tha f***in' bomb bay
ya got dissed, that's before it's in cast like bob may
my rhymes
i leave a mark on ya mind
as the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pimes
there's no escape
na i ain't blastin' i use my mental
to assassinate assassin's
for those askin'
opposed to laughin'
raw maniacal villian
laughter enhances the chances of tha killin'
why is that ?
cause smilin' faces decieve
you best believe
to mc's, i'm the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
ya whole camp's under seige, and i'm jason vorhees
in the heat of the night
is when i defeat and ignite mic's
my verbal snipe, your vocabal site
i'm out tha cut, uncut
and raw with no clause fall
so all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
the raider rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
i rock from here to there, to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware, second, prepare to enter verbal combat
f*** you losers, while you fake jacks i makes maneuvers
like hitler
stickin' up jews wit german missles
the mister mef tical from staton isle
will be back after this message
don't touch tha dial
rarely do you see and mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket
blauw!
mellons get swellin', i paint mental pictures like magellen
half of my clan, repeat felons
n****s best protect they joint tha nine nickel
man i stay on point like icicles
now who want to test tical
then test tical
all up in ya muthaf***in' mouth
head banga boogie
catch me on tour with al doogie
method man roll too tight, you can't fool me
better take one and pass or that's that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast

non believers get my d*** and genitals backwards
let's face it, there's no replacement

let's turn this house
into a happy home
let's turn this house
into a happy home
let's turn this house
into a happy home
verse 1:
now we been kicking it, for quite some time
remain beside me, through my trials
in this life of crime, we done fought
so many times, i forgot to count
i never hit you, now the coward
rather leave your house, remember back in december
when we was tight, sippin' alize and crystal
while in every night in my bedroom
promise that i commit to you soon
tongue kiss me everytime you see
we step inside a room, straight out the hood
we promise to be good to each other
plus i love you so i know you goin' make a good mother
just try to understand if i change a time
it's only cause i never owned anything that's mine
so i'm trying, you can stay with my momma but keep the drama
to a low, never call the police
i never call you b**** or hoe
we were all born hungry in this world alone
finally moved out
my mom's house
and got a happy home
chorus : female singer 
hap py home hap py home 
hap py home happy home
verse 2 :
born through hard times ghetto child of mine
i wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
to be honest it's a hard road
just keep your faith in god
knowin' you can be scarred though
look at him walkin' and talkin'
a little child with my eyes and mouth
father, watch over little seeds
help me guide them out
had to change my whole lifestyle
married my baby's momma
made her my wife now
i'm tryin' hard y'all
maybe in time
i'll be a better man
watching the older couples handle it like veterans
show me the meaning of forever
and together we rise if it would
help our child grow live together
we die
why question my love
it's so easy to see without my family
all i'm left with is a shadow of me
after all the arguements and the nights alone
now it's time to live the good life
inside a happy home
chorus :
hap py home hap py home 
hap py home hap py home 
male singer  :
all these problems got me gone,we got a family of our own
i just want a happy home long as we just stand up alone, i'll promise i won't do you wrong
i just want a happy home 
female singer 
hap py home hap py home 
hap py home

"simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
hoping my information, alleviates the hesitiation
i can see it clearly now, got you smiling through your frown
i'm askin' baby boo, ""r u down?""
although i know you've heard about my reputation...across the nation
mr.""i get around""...my temptation got me dripping wet , perspiration
i'm activated by the moves you making
baby, why you fakin'? strip naked get to love making
see its all in your mind, so every time i sip a glass of wine
i fantasize till that ass is mine
never gettin' but want it, never touching but wishing
a straight thug on a mission until i get what i'm missing
stop with the beeper, baby listen...
i know you're grown, but pay attention, let me hypnotize with my tongue kissin'
this is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes...
turn around one mo' time, heaven ain't hard to find
[hook:
heaven ain't hard to find
]
heaven ain't hard to find, infact you can have it
just have faith...just like a little kid, still believing in magic
it takes a lot of scarifice, and with all the lonely nights
on tour...i need somebody i can trust in my life
let me apply the brakes...maybe i'm moving too fast
my conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask
are you afraid of a thug?
and have you ever made love with candles and bubbles, slipping in the tub
touch me and let me activate your blood pressure...this thug pleasure
help the average man love better
picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
just take a shot of that alize'... come give me a kiss
and maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
be the thug in your life...baby and you'll be my soulja
and i know it takes up time, and you got a lot of questions on your mind
but relax...in due time, heaven ain't hard to find
you think we all dogs...thats why you cautious when i approached you
been talking since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
through my eye contact...i wink and you respond back
look at me...whats all that? its like the closer you get, baby the quicker i'm speaking
i got a flight out to chicago, lets kick it this weekend
i'm sipping henessy and coke...tho' addicted to weed smoke
i'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
oh god, help me identify me truest thoughts
your hidden motives, full of passion who would of thought
come holla at me baby, love me for my thug nature
far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
straight heart breaker...
baby we can be friends, i'll come scoop you in my benz
we'll ride...i'll let you floss it for your friends
once we begin...until the end, it gets better with time
i'm makin' love to your mind baby...heaven ain't hard to find"

so i laugh til i cry, when the law come get me
no baby momma drama, n**** miss me, why plant seeds
in a dirty b****, waitin to trick me, not the life for me
livin carefree, til i'm buried   and if they dare me
i'm bustin on n****z until they scurry, i'm clearly
a man of military means in my artillery
watchin over me through every murder scene
from adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
sellin dope to all the fiends, at times i wanna cry
and still, we try to change the past, in vain
never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
of cocaine, the product of the devil, am i sellin my soul?
got tired of small time livin, n****z tellin me no
i got mine, f*** them other suckers, that's the mentality
jealous ass bustaz, make it hell for us
chorus: 2pac  *repeat 2x*
lord, help me change my ways
show a little mercy on judgment day
it ain't me, i was raised this way
i never let em play me for a busta, make it hell 4 a hustler
now in these last days and times i takes mines so serious
gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
if i fail, then i suffer, bein broke is hell 4 a hustler
so i stay strugglin and jugglin with all the might i can muster
since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
one's five's and ten's was funny money

and if the cops come arrest me in the evening

"hold on, be strong

ran with a bad bunch
little skinny kid sneaking weed in my bag lunch
and off in junior high
we was just getting by
and drive bys robbed my homies of their young lives
i never did cry
even though i had pain in my heart
i was hopeless from the start
they couldn't tell me nothing
they all tried to help to help me
the marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
i traveled places
caught cases
what a ill year
i felt the pain in the rain
but i'm still here
never did like the police
let the whole world know
now i gets no peace
cause they chasing me down
and facing me now
well do i do these things that a thug goes through?
still i rise
so keep ya head up
and make ya mind strong
its a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
hold on
be strong

when it's on it's on"
"my homeboys in clinton and rikers island
mumia, mutulu, sendeko, gerino pratt,
all the political prisoners
san quiton
yeah
one thug, one thug
how do we keep the music playing
one thug, one thug
i wake up early in the morning
my state so military
suckas fantasize, pictures of a
young brother buried
was it me, the weed, or this life i lead
if daytime is for suckas then
tonight we bleed
out for all that
knowing that this world brings drawbacks
look how this shit bumps
once i deliver these war raps
meet me at the cemetary
dressed in black
tonight we
follow the dead
and those who won't be back
so if i die
to the same for me
shed no tears
an outlaw, thug living in this game,
for years
why worry,
hope to god
get me high
when i'm buried
knowing deep inside me
only if yah love
come rush me to the gates of heaven
let me picture for a while
how i live for my days, as a child
i wonder now
how do we outlast, always get cash
stay strong if we all mash
hold your head
chorus
how do we keep the music playing
how do we get ahead
to many young black brothers are dying
living fast, too fast
these felonies be like prophecies
begging me to stop
cuz these lawyers getting money
everytime they knock us
slashing pockets lyrically
suckas fleed when they notice
switched my name to makaveli
had the rap game closed
expose foes, with my hocus pocus flows
they froze
now suckas idealize my choosen blows
more money mean litigating
more playa hating
got a cell at the penn for me waiting
is this my fate
miss me with that mistermeaner thinking
me fall back
never that
too much tequilla drinking
we all that
make them understand me
hey i'll stay all night out with my posse
everyone roll with me is family
cuz everybodies got me
watch me paint a perfect vision
this life we living
got us all meeting up in prison
last week i got a letter from my road dog
written in blood
saying, ""please show a young playa love""
hold your head
hold it
chorus
how do we keep the music playing
how do we get ahead
to many young black brothers are dying
living fast, too fast
god bless the child that can hold is own
indeed
enemies bleed when i hold my chrome
let these words be to last
to my unborn seeds
hope to raise my young nation
in this world of greed
currency means nothing if you still ain't free
money breeds jealousy
take the game from me
i hope for better days
trouble comes naturally
running from authorities
till they capture me
and my aim is to spread more smiles than tears
utilalize lessons learned from my childhood years
maybe mama had it all right
rest your head
straight converstion all night
bless the dead
to the homies that i usta have
that no longer roll
catch a brother at the crossroads
plus nobody knows my soul
watching time pass
through the glass of my drop top
hold your head

and then
i hit the studio
it's time to blow tha block up
no hesitation
this information got you contemplatin'
heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
break him
and let him see tha face of a mental patient
it's a celebration
of my criminal elevation
with the participation
i want members across tha fifty states
to keep tha nation anticipatin' until we break
will i be great, is it my fate ?
to live tha life of luxury
some n****s bought my tapes
so much jelousy it scares me
so be prepared
cause only tha strong survive
life isn't fair probably never knew tha way it feels to die
so you figure f*** with me
i give that ass a try
n****, holla at me

i shoulda saw tha signs
i was blinded
criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
so many brothas framed in this dirty game
it's a shame
so much pressure on my brain
while she blame me
secrets in tha dark
only her and i know
now i'm sitten' in tha state pen
doin time for slow
guess she made a bad decision
that got me livin'
just like an animal
i'm caged up in state prison
my n****s dissin'
cause
hell have no fury like a woman scorn
a cemetary full of mothaf***ers got not knowin'
picture my prophecy
tha cops are attacking me, on top of me
i'm runnin' from tha coppers
but never let'em stop me
cause i'm a soulja
hell, ever since i was a little n**** havin' fantasies
of one day getting older
n****s is paranoid
trust
a no no
love is a mystery

and in time
you'll find a rhyme
that'll blaze you'll feel the fire
from the n****s in my younger dayz

"i was raised a little young n**** doin' bad shit
talk much shit, cause i never had shit
i can remember bein' whooped in class
and if i didn't pass momma would whoop my ass
was it my fault poppa didn't plan it out?
broke out left me to be the man of the house.
i couldn't take it, had to make a profit
found a block, got a glock, and i clocked grip
makin g's was my mission
movin enough of this shit to get my momma out the kitchen
and why must i sock a fella
just to live large like rockafella
first you didn't give a f***, but you learnin now
if you don't respect our town, then will burn you down
god dam, it's a mutherf***in riot
black people on a rage, police so don't try it
if your not from the town, then don't pass through
cause some o g's, fools might blast you
it ain't right but it's long overdue
we can't have peace, till the n****s get a piece too
i want g so you labeled me a criminal
and if i die, i wonda if heaven's got a ghetto.
i wonder if heaven's got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven's got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven's got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven's got a ghetto
here on earth
tell me whats a black life worth
a bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
and even when you take the shit
move cowards get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
ask rodney, natasha, and many more
it's been goin on for years, theres plenty more
when they ask me when will i violence cease?
when your troops stop shootin n****s down in the streets
n****s had enough, time to make a difference
bear witness on are own business
f*** the gaurd cause it's hard tryin to make ends meet
but we couldn't afford the shit, now everythings free
so we loot, please don't shot when ya see

and for once i was down with n****s
felt good in the hood, being around the n****s yeah
and the first time everybody let go
the streets is death row
i wonda if heaven's got a ghetto.
i see no changes, all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgraced races
we under, i wonder what it takes to make this
one better place, let erase the wasted
take the evil out the people they'll be actin right
cause both black and white is smokin crack tonight
and the only time we deal is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
although it seems heaven sent
we ain't ready to have a black president huh
and ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
i wake up in the mornin, and ask myself
is life worth livin ,should i blast myself
i'm tired of being poor and even worse, i'm black
my stomach hurts, so i'm lookin for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull a trigga, kill a n**** , he's a hero
mo' n****, mo' n****, mo' n****s
rather be a dead then a po' n****
let the lord judge the criminals, and if i die
i wonda if heaven's got a ghetto."

"ever since you was a pee wee, down by my knee with a wee wee
we been coochie coo all through school, you and me g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
all through high school, girls by the dozens
sayin we cousins, knowin that we wasn't
but like the old saying goes
times goes on, and everybody grows
grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
you chose the dope gaaaane, my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with ak's
and though i been around clowning with the underground
i'm still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need, need anything at all
i drop it all for y'all, if my homies call
it's a shame, you chose the dope game
now you slang cane on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo' cane
you got game now you run with no shame
i chose rappin tracks to make stacks
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
but now i don't wanna down my homie
no matter how low you go you're not lowly
and i, hear that you made a few enemies
but when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
if you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
i'll be there in an instant
who am i to judge another brother, only on his cover
i'd be no different than the other
h to the o to the m to the i to the e
i'm down to the e n d
cause it's a fall in no time at all
i'm down for y'all, when my homies call
word, if my homies call
well it's ninety one and i'm livin kinda swell now
but i hear that you're going through some hell pal
but life makin records ain't easy
it ain't what i expected it's hectic it's sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving, working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
it's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
to be great, i'm giving it all it takes
trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take, my place or fall from grace
the foolish way, the pace is quick and great
smiling face, to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
that's why i wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on
no matter who the foe they must fall
us against them all i'm down to brawl if my homies call"

not understanding the destiny, had a plan for me...

"in the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
i hope i die for a princeple
or a belief that i have lived for
i will die before my time
beacause i feel the shadow's depth
so much i wanted to acomplish
before i reached my death
i have to come to grips with the possibility
and wiped the last tear from my eyes
i loved all who were positive
in the event of my demise
in the event of my demise don't shed no tear
i'll share my wizdom with the world, they'll know i was here
know i was clear, every thing i said i ment
a outlaw, when i was born they prepared my ditch
said i won't live long, statistic showed
i'm tryna past 24 realistic goal, listen all
you gotta stay cold inside
that's what i tell myself when i feel alone sometime
but i can't cry, i don't tear no more
i love god, from death i don't fear no more
a part taken in this movment to better my people
though they see me on tv, i tell them we equal
don't look at me as a stranger, i'm one of your own
we was rised in concrete and grew as a rose
still i rise, but never get a chance to fly
mama please don't cry
in the event of my demise
in the event of my demise
can't breathe no more
hope i die for a princeple
something i lived for
dying before my time
feel the shadows of depth
trying to fulfill all my dreams before i reach my death
came to grips with the possibility
the world's killing me, and my soldiers die young with no sympathy
i wipe the last tear from my eyes
i loved all who stand strong
in the event of my demise
if i should die before i awake
let my family be stairght of the money i make
give my son, what he needs, other than his father
is it self respect, better get his honor
with the law come to swallow my soul, it's so big
cause the street took enough of my life, we all see
it's a cycle make you feel psycho
everything struggles behind this man, see nobody love you
got a piece of the streets and it's gonna die with me
may your, soul forgive me
makaveli's within me
in principle we stand by stronger than power
we gon' die by the rules you can never devour
on the earth from my birth fell nothing but pain
only thing i ever gave was the baby the name
that's my heart, and if i should go i'll go on in sparks
that's the event of my demise, and it lurks in the dark
now as i stand here, a man here
not a perfect one, but a searching one
seek in another, blazing time
sound crazy but i'm actually tryin to escape my mind
tryna rise in time
but hoping that you didn't notice
when i was at my low as
so i knew they were watching, i couldn't stop it
so many things i wanted to accomplish
too many dreams, wasted with no promise
from out the darkness i struggle to see the light
rumble deep in the night
hustlin with all of my might
some won't see it that way
but us is given praise
but all of them will dream
that i did it my way
in the event of my demise
i was born to a storm that won't lead up
and i was rased to stay brave with my head up
but thing ain't got better
we still gettin wetter in this bad weather
i need more than a sweater and a leather
yo, ain't nothin ment to last forever
so the stuggling and the suffering ain't gon' last forever
and my will, probably be like two lines long
it will read i'm dead but my soul lives on
and my spirit still living though my body is gone
in the event of my demise i love all who stay strong
i love all who stay strong
in the event of my demise, com'on
in the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
i hope i die for a princeple
or a belief that i have lived for
i will die before my time
beacause i feel the shadow's depth
so much i wanted to acomplish
before i reached my death
i have to come to grips with the possibility
and wiped the last tear from my eyes
i loved all who were positive
in the event of my demise"

"in today's news the ever controversial
tupac shakur just released another album
under the alias makaveli.
music insiders are running wild
trying to rearrange other artistry dates
in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album,
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rapper's
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate
the character of not only mr. shakur
but of death row records as well.
nas the alleged ring leader of is furious
of tupac's excuse me, makaveli's verbal assault
on mobb sleep, notorius p.i.g., and several other new york rapper's.
jay z of hawaiian soapy fame,
big little whatever and several other corny sounding motherf***as
are understandibly shakin up by this release.
the question everbody wants to know is
""why'd they get this n**** started?""
tupac rather, makaveli was not available
for comment but released this statement:
""it's not about east or west.
it's about n****s and bytchez,
power and money, ridahz and punkz.
which side are you on?"""
"news reporter:
good evening, i'm reporting live from sunset boulevard
where many excited fans have gathered with candles
awaiting the much anticipated release, of tupac shakur's latest album, better dayz
this is yet another posthumorous release by tupac
which, raises the question, where are these songs coming from?
it's interesting how, the message in these songs
is still relevant today
even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
i can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
when the album will officially be released
oh, hold on, i, think they're starting to countdown now
crowd:
5, 4, 3, 2, 1..."
"song fades in ...
at 12:25am wednesday, tupac was on his way into a
time square building
to record at an eight floor studio to record with another rapper
but in the lobby shakur was shot several times including two
graze wounds to the head
tupac's lawyers said the attack appeared to be a setup
against doctors orders tupac shakur checked himself out of
the hospital
less than 24 hours after being shot 5 times on the way
into a manhattan recording studio
tupac shakur secures one clean legal victory this year
as he's dismissed of assault charges brought against him when
he allegedly shot
at two off duty atlantic cops on halloween last year.
the case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence
more controvery surrounding tupac shakur ...
meanwhile, in tupac news, at about 6:45 tonight,
shakur may have lowered his own chances of surviving the attack,
by checking himself out of the hospital, that probably saved his life
tupac shakur checked into the metropolitan hospital yesterday
under an assumed name,
his lawyers said that he had connections, but wouldn't say
what kind,
that could provide top notch security for the injured rap star
shakur underwent surgery today ...
the shooting of tupac shakur here in new york city once again
underscores that violence that has surrounded this man since
he shot
to superstardom in the world of music and entertainment
fades out ..."

last year was a hard one, but life goes on
bumpin' my head against the wall
learnin' right from wrong
they say my ghetto instrumental, detrimental to kids
as if they can't see the misery in which they live
blame me for the outcome, ban my records, check it
don't have to bump this, but please respect it
i took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
hennessy got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
rollin' in my drop top jag, what's that cops thinkin'?
sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
i came a long way, but still i got so far to go
dear mama, don't worry, i'mma watch for snakes
tell setchu that i love her, but it's hard today
i got the letter that she sent me, and i cried for weeks
this what came out when i tried to speak, all i heard was
time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a n**** going' crazy
i feel crazy
time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a n**** goin' crazy
i feel crazy
i see bloods and crips runnin' up the hill
lookin' for a better way
my brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
'cause even thug n****s pray
hopin' god hear me, i entered the game
look how much i changed
i'm no longer innocent, casualties of fame
made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
and i swear i seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
when i gave her the keys to her own house
this your land
your only son done became a man
watchin' time fly, i love my people, do or die
but i wonder why we scared to let each other fly
june 1 6, '71, the day
mama pushed me out her womb, told me
""n****, get paid! ""
no one can understand me, the black sheep
outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
i run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
when he died, i could hear him say 
time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a n**** goin' crazy
i feel crazy
time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a n**** goin' crazy
i feel crazy 
god, help me out here, 'cause i'm possessed
i need the root of all evil for my stress
'cause money's like a strong prescription drug
it's got me addicted
to the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
somethin' about the paper
with the pictures of the president's head, damn
it's like a motherf***in' plague that spread
it's epidemic, forgotten, forgotten it got worse
i keep my head on straight, makin' money
'cause it's cursed
makin' money makes a difference day by day
so i gotta stay paid, no doubt, day in and day out
this life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
no matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
a lot of my peers didn't make it to the years to come
did life doin' right or did life livin' dumb
who has the answers? i wonder, i turn to my elders
they aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
 'cause they don't even know
a million things run through my mind you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time
time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a n**** goin' crazy
i feel crazy
time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a n**** goin' crazy

from bootycalls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin
if i wake up in the county in my jail sheets
my intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
probably involves me comin up with just to see another day
might be me who bites the bullet
in these streets where a man journey
with crooked cops and a society who tryin to burn me
i'm like a pit in a cage, spittin my shells in a gauge
deadly as aids, n****z gettin crossed like a maze
now picture me livin my life like a king, maybe one day
until then i'm livin monday through sunday

cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

""last night..""
""i don't give a f***, where you gon'.. be""

n****z in low lows, pursuin mo' hoes, then go home
the life of a california star, and when you see me
in the drop top jag', how many n****z wanna be me?
game is automatic, manditory i sell
to live or die, i survive, but with a story to tell
cause when you gettin some riches, watch for dumb b****es
they have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue kissin
it's a mean world n**** you strapped, or be a throwaway
will i survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
nobody knows me, i'm a shadow
my army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
cause when i'm out in the streets, i'm on point, where the static?
too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
i dissapear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
for my n****z up in clentin gettin weeded
continue to roll until i'm old, ride until i die
supply long as you motherf***ers buy
my homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin
slappin n****z known for tellin b****es f*** it in the late night
""last night.. last night changed it all""
 it's in the late night!
""last night..""
""i don't give a f***, where you gon'.. be""

and run you down like a truck
i'll take a chance i go as far as rock can see

"uhh.. dear mr. president

pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
ain't nothin changed
all the promises you made, before you got elected..
.. they ain't came true
tell me what to do, these n****z actin up in the hood
send mo' troops, dear mr. president
tell me what to do, these n****z actin up in the hood
send mo' troops..
why should i lie, when i can dramatize?
n****z fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
simply by spittin i've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
cause i'm seldom in the company of b****es
plus the concepts i depict, so visual, that you can kiss
each and every trick or b****, inside the shit i kick
my heaviest verse'll move a mountain
casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin
f*** the friendships, i ride alone
destination death row, finally found a home
plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
dear lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
yours i'm a thug, the product of a broken home
everybody's doped up, n**** what you smokin on?
figure if we high they can train us
but then america f***ed up and blamed up
i guess it's cause we black that we targets
my only fear is god, i spit that hard shit
in case you don't know, i let my pump go
get ?ride for m'thulu? like i ride for geronimo
down to die, for everything i represent
meant every word, in my letter to the president
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these n****z actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these n****z actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
oh youse a ball in the white house, i hope you comfortable
cause yo i spend my nights out, with the lights out
under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
and young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
launch it, leave a n**** flat for scratch, the godless
i gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
wanna ban rap? stand back, before you get hurt
it's the only thing makin pay besides smoke and work
on a mission listen more chips my goal and position
first on my decision i realized the same n****
trippin to drastic measures tryin to get stacks of cheddar
muh'f***ers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin better
but you keep, tellin us, that it is
while your motherf***in troops keep killin our kids, dig
don't be surprised if you see us
dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherf***er
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these n****z actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these n****z actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
it's hostile, n****z lick shots to watch the glocks glow
cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
and it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
to people beefin and things, squeakin on they beefs for weeks
mr. president, it's evident, nobody really care
for a struggle out the gutter, twenty two with gray hair
i was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
so i'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
but y'all play fair, give me and mine, i'll share
til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
me and these 223'sll freeze the biggest with ease
i'm still a n**** you fear, bring the beast to his knees
and i've been born to represent, for that i've been heaven sent
and i meant, every word, in my letter, to the president
shit is still f***ed up y'all
and y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
and it ain't gon' get better
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these n****z actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these n****z actin up..
heavenly father may i holla at you briefly
i wanna meet the president, but will he meet me?
he's scared to look inside the eyes of a thug n****
we tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin
how hypocritical is liberty?
that blind b**** ain't never did shit for me
my history, full of casket and scars
my own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
and they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin hard
sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was god?
somewhere in the middle of my mind
is a n**** on the tightrope, screamin let him die
can't lie i'm a thug, drownin in my own blood
lookin for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
down to die, for everything i represent
meant every word, in my letter to the president
blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin low?
y'all sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo'?
tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
day after day, and night after night
battles and wars to the daylight

till the concept of time
6 hours, 22 minutes, and 3 seconds, i've been standing in this
county line
by the looks of the gridlock outside
its gotta be about 3:39
everybody rushin from place to place
the looks on their faces ain't no different from mine
both of us look like we just worked a 9 5
see, but when i clock out
i'm not looking for stress, but for the kind share
since i started this county line shift,
huh did i say shift? i mean this sentence
i've heard nothing but sirens outside the door
how much you want to bet there's an ambulance rushin a short man,
o.d. man, police abused black man to the hospital?
now what they rushin for is my intrest?
rushin through traffic jam to get to emergency room traffic jam, that's
susppose to be a free clinic
only to hear if you have or don't have insurance
it ain't nuttin but survivial of the fittest
so what they rushin for?
and damn this man at the window is slow
the concept of time has os all f***ed, and on top of that,
life ain't nuttin but a traffic jam.
life is too short, i feel trapped
hopping i don't get caught, watch my back
lost in the traffic, heartless and tragic
don't wanna get my ass kicked
so i walk in this mindless state, and a don't make me feel this way
i'll tell ya
life is a traffic jam, i'm stuck
when will you realize your f***ed?
don't try to change my ways, i'm hopeless
victims to the games we play, stay focused
watch for the crazy ride, don't lie
high till the day we die
i'ts my life
tell me if you feel me
i'll tell ya
life is a traffic jam sincerely
stretch your mind, spoon feed your soul
3 voices you can't control
remember life is a traffic jam
life is a traffic jam "

maybe i was just a lost soul, trapped in time
livin in between life, and the cracks were blind
even though we had hope for dreams that never came
yet and still we all feel pain
just wait until rain turn to sunshine
cause i hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
duckin one time! stranded in the county in the worst way
hell of a way to spend my twenty first birthday
born in the ghetto as a street thug
it's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
lost souls...
lost souls n****, for my homeboys that passed on
words from the mind of a lost soul
just wait until rain turn to sunshine
cause i hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
duckin one time!
my brother sean, first on my list, he stuck with
a three five when he get out would i be dead or alive
he taught me the rules so much, but still in thugs i trust
when in danger never hesitate to keep my f*ckin trap shut
my mom dukes got a little bit of thug in her
the devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer
sometimes i feel like the streets are takin over
never stayin sober, the brain over and over backtrack
my stack's fat, i used to take new
one love to my crew aiyyo this one's for you
r.i.p., rest in peace to moo brown
know what we gotta do baby, one time
just wait until rain turn to sunshine
cause i hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
duckin one time!
one time! one time! one time!
i was born twenty two years ago, yesterday
but see i saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate
entered the world from out a poisonous womb
heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon
to be one of the many misguided
always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it
lost before i had a chance to find my way
now i travel through life, not knowin the time of day
crime for pay, i'm on my way, but don't know, where i'ma end up
i swear to god, it's just a setup
and these are the words from the mind of a lost soul 
just wait until rain turn to sunshine
cause i hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
duckin one time!
all of y'all, keepin y'all in health
to all of y'all, keepin y'all in health

"i know this girl and her name is minnie
livin' in the projects didn't own a penny
met her at a school dance so i took a chance
walked her to the parkin' lot for a little romance
got to my car, put the key in the ignition
turned on the slow jams, i was on a mission
i was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox
i was ""j"" and knockin' boots right down the socks
she was freaky and wild, oh man could i call it?
but when i dropped her off, she had stole my wallet
i couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher coocher?
but that was my first experience with minnie the moocher!!
minnie the moocher was a legend on the block i'm from
a dream girl to many brothers, but true to none
her reputation was enormous   a real go getter
and once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her
maybe it was her smile, her personality or
the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
but whatever it was, minnie the moocher was an expert
real heart breaker, but never get hurt
she had this boyfriend, his name was diamond
helpin' minnie out with the little social climbin'
met with politicians, peace to many others
suddenly and instantly, they became her lovers
she took the power that they possessed
and minnie did it all without gettin' undressed
minnie dissed diamond sayin' that he could not live with her
but he wanted payment for the things he did for her
he grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand
minnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand
she was a legend to everyone who knew her
that's is my memory of minnie the moocher
minnie had a boyfriend, a gambler
addicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basshead, crack smoker
he took her to harlem, and all around chinatown
he bought some bass, a pipe a tape of hard rap sounds
she was an addict, tired of the static and poverty
sick of the same ghetto misery
see, minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement
smokey was a hoodlum, headin' for indictment
then one day their relationship stopped
when smokey was killed by the m i c cops
minnie was hurt, lost without a clue
to her, there was no chance of gettin' somebody new
so she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems
she cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams
she had dreams and schemes about the king of sweden
he gave her things that this girl was much needin'
a plush house made of gold and steel
a diamond car with a platt in the wheel
now you might think this is a lot of stuff
but to minnie this was not enough
he bought a stable, full of thorough bred race horses
his meal she ate was a dozen courses
she had a fortune in nickels and dimes
and she sat around and counted it a billion times
she had bank, yeah minnie was clockin'
had every sucker in the neighborhood jockin'!!
she would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye
then she dissin', with zero reply"
"""my block ""
damn, take a ride, to my block
my block, that's right! heh
f'real on my motherf***in block
they got a n****
sheddin tears, reminiscin on my past fears
cause shit was hectic for me last year
it appears that i've been marked for death, my heartless breath
the underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
and no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary
for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
but at times unnessecary, i'm gettin worried
teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
and certain death for us ghetto bastards
what can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
life in the pen ain't for me, cause i'd rather die
but don't cry through your despair
i wonder if the lord still cares, for us n****z on welfare
and who cares if we survive
the only time they notice a n**** is when he's clutchin on a four five
my neighborhood ain't the same
cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
and i swear it's like a trap
but i ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when i go back
hoes show me love, n****z give me props
forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block
livin life is but a dream
hard times is all we see every block is kinda mean
but on our block we still prayyyyyy
but on our block we still prayyyyyy...
now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
black male slippin in hail when will we prevail
fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
and the system's sucidal with this thug's life
stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life
god help me, cause i'm starvin, can't get a job
so i resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
mislead from childhood where i went astray
till this day i still pray for a better way
can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
from the start i felt the racism cause i'm dark
couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
hit the bar and played the star, everywhere i went
in my heart, i felt alone out here on my own
i close my eyes and picture home... on my block
and i can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
caught strays from ak's and the driveby
swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
cause our block is filled with danger
used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
time changes us to stone them crack pipes
all up and down the block exterminatin black life
but i can't blame the dealers
my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
shit's real, i know ya feel, my tragedy
a single mother with a problem child, daddy free
hangin out pickin up game, sippin cheap liquor
gamin the hoochies hopin i can get to sleep with her
it's a man's world, stayin strapped
fantasies of a n**** livin phat, but held back
pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
wide eyed and losin focus... on my block
and block parties in tha projects lastin way past daylight
a young n**** learned to break night
used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
i send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
i see the same motherf***ers ballin
alcohol will make a lazy n**** slip and fall, miss his call
i know the young n****z understand this
growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
i reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes
tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
and what's strange is everybod knows my name, swear they all know me
and lots of cash make a n**** change
i hit the green just to maintain, feelin pain
for all the n****z that i lost to the game... from my block
rest in peace to all the muh'f***ers who passed away
from all the blocks that i'm from
one twelve street, 7th avenue, new york, uptown, knahmsayin?
183rd and walt, my block, that's right
122nd and morningside, my block, that's right
decatur avenue, baltimore, my block, that's right
in the jungle of marin city, that's my block, that's right
los angeles, haha, that's my block too
oakland, can't forget oaktown, that's my block for sure
and all the other blocks around this motherf***er
houston, florida, st. louis, tennessee, miami, chicago
all y'all n****z stay kickin up dust
represent the motherf***in block"
"tupac:
i lay awake tonite
because i wanna be with u
if u were beside me i’d playfully kiss u
each time i see u the feeling gets stronger
u sit with me closer we stare a lot longer
reach for my drink and for a second we touch
words r muttered i stutter
cause i want u taht much
the situation is a no win
cause he’s my best friend
but now i’m guilty
i’m fallin’ for his girlfriend
i know it’s wrong but my heart is filled with purity
i offer passion but he offers security
it’s like a trap that i’m sinkin’ into
i wake up sweaty when i’m thinkin’ of u
then we make our contact
and i can’t hold back
i try to shake it but the feeling comes right back
what have i gotten into
i feel possessed by u
i have these thought at nite of undressin’ u
it’s kinda obvious blind men might see
but he doesn’t so he keps on trustin me
leaves me alone with u when he’s on vacation
but how could he leave me with this temptation
what do i do go or stay and play it smart
it’s gettin’ rougher cause i suffer from a burnin’ heart
my burnin’ heart
ray:
girl u r my one and only
u r my angel and now u wanna leave me lonely
what did i do baby did i treat u bad?
my heart is broken and now u wanna make me sad
i remember when this love affair first started
we were so in love and now we are departed
girl i’ll buy anything your heart desires
i have to let u know baby your my fire
warm and wet each kiss i prolonged
it’s your sweet caress that makes life too strong
just being with u and see the two of us
walking along the beach u know u r my peach
so sweet and my love i surrender
no need to pretend that u want it to end
i’ll neva let u go your foreva my girl
u know why?
cause girl u r my world
my burnin’ heart
tupac:
totally tongue tied every few seconds i keep watchin’ u
he’s my best friend but i can’t help clockin’ u
how could this be how could we both love u
now i’m trapped in this position and don’t know whta to do
i could forget about u pretend taht we neva met
but when i hear bout u i start to heavily sweat
u give me looks to reinforce thoughts
that r already there
so many times my eyes r caught up in a passanger stare
play the role like u don’t matter
he swears taht we hate eachotha
your my addiction cause i fiend for u desperately
stand here fantasizing cause you’re next to me
what can i do with this passion i feel
it’s too hard to conceal so i know it’s for real
watched u so many times where every curve is
i think he reads my mind so i’m feelin nervous
i wanna tell u how i feel but that wouldn’t help
i would only cause problems so i keep to myself
it drives me crazy to see u sittin’ with him
a tear goes down my cheek because i see u kiss him
i know the words ya sayin’ b4 they could be said
hear the thoughts you’re thinkin’ b4 they come into your head
wouldn’t hurt the bratha for anything in this world
but damm i feel in love with his girl
my burnin’ heart
ray:
my heart is burnin’ u know it’s yearnin’
for your sweet caress
i lay in exstacy as u kiss and rub my chest
u know u love me why must u deny yourself?
what i could offer u yet u want somebody else
it’s not taht girl well then girl what could it be
i hope i’m good for u cause girl you’re good for me
many nites i cried and tried to make this work
then act a fool and croon the cruel like a jerk
well i’m sorry baby i have to let u know
u r my life my strenght i refuse to let u go
u r so fruitful baby u light up my life
i close my eyes and dream that you’d become my wife
day in and day out it’s u i pray about
don’t lock the door to your heart don’t make me stay out
i love u honey cause you’re like a work of art
you’ve got me on fire my burnin’ heart

my words to my firstborn, nothing left to hear

probaly never even saw it coming
to busy bullshitting
caught him with his mouth runnin
ain't that a b****
they got me twisted in this game
the fedz, and the po police pointing pistols at my brain
i wonder if i'm wrong
cause i'm thugged out
my homies murdered execution style
runnin in the drug house
what was suppose to be a easy hit
now shit is flipped
cause n****s died over bullshit
it's not my dream
seeing pictures of a broken man
no witnesses
only the question of a smoked man
young addalicent in the prime live the life of crime
but what ain't logical
we hobble through these trying times
living blind
lord help me with my troubled soul
why all my homiez had to die before they got to grow
and right before i put my head on the pillow
i saw a prayer
one love to the thug's in heaven
i'll see you there
it's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
help me make it threw the storm
the words to my first born feel me
my words to my firstborn
my words to my first born
since my very first day on this earth
i was cursed
so i knew the birth of a child would make my life worst
though it hurst me
there was no remorse
cause wild seeds can't grow
watch your soul
cause you know what you had to do
so the victims of the world came to
i understand there is a better day coming
sometimes catching you sleeping on the dead end
driving with the car running blinded
ain't no love in the hood
only hearts torn
love letters to the unsitting unborn
all the babies that died up on the table
wasn't able to breathe
cause the family wasn't able
can't blaim i would do the same
all i could give it was my depth and my last name
cause in the game things change living up and down
this hard life got me walking with my head down
flashing frowns wasn't meant to be
was i wrong
but i'll never get to know
so i carry on
it's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
my words to my firstborn, feel me
my words to my first born
my n****s nutso up in this b****
these are my words to my firstborn
i'm just another thug n**** trapped in this ghetto life
an endless hustla
struggling trying to settle right
and doing dirt ain't saving me
but the streets is the only thing paying me, feel me
running with g's
stacking g's
packing e's
mobb life to these mothaf***as wack me
stacking greenary
thugging to i die
picking up so much j

thinking i'm the reason why this n**** got his head through
on the run
now daddy got to pack a gun
cause these n****s want me to make you the last one
about these riches
these jealous b****es are going to sell through
welcome to life
and if i die
remember that it is all love when i'm by your side
every night
don't be a loser
choose your dreams through your things
cause solo to the ho ho will twitch you up
like shoe strings
open your eyes
don't let these haters get you
roll up and diss you

body gonna diss me now i'm comin' exact
i'm paid i got it made, now that i'm makin' tracks
this is a lesson, at bein' dope that is
cordless mics is mine, the wheels are his
tons and tons of freaks i'm a mac daddio
writin' def jams while i'm chillin' on my patio
you are useless as a toothless piranha
i'm ruthless now i'm gonna
bust it and discuss it make it funky to hear
paragraph to the people penetratin' your ear
you wanna taste of it, ooh here take a full dose
burn you up like radiation if you get too close
cause my mouth is like an uzi when it moves so quick
and the lyrics are the bullets that i'm loadin' it with
you wanna beat me homeboy, you will be destroyed
get dropped like a habit and played like a toy
never defeated not conceited, but let's face facts
couldn't beat me with a motherf***in' baseball bat
if i gave you a bomb that was nuclear armed
you could shoot it at me sucker and i wouldn't get harmed
cause punk you can't stop me, bullets couldn't drop me
stand on a mountain and still couldn't top me, huh
you think you'll beat me boy get it together
cause i'll never be beat ya punk never!!
when you hear my beat thumpin' it's a maxium charge
cause i'm the hip hop hood, the record leader at large
got a phd in hip hop history
a deadly boy not a toy but a poetry, prodigy!!
young beat conisseur hummin' like a bird
it was true when you heard i'm the wiz a word
your eyes dilate, your ears drums expand
when my voice comes through the speaker from the mic in my hand
woofers stompin' like thunder all about to explode
the needle on the nuance stuck in overload
don't laugh cause i'm serious mister mysterious
don't make me mad  cause i get furious
countless time after time just when you think i'm through
i let my melody stretch to make more for you
just bust it cause i'm just too clever
and i'll never be beat ya punk, never!!
rhyme fumble suckers tumble, god damn i'm good
since i was born i was strong, always knew that i could
don't care anywhere any place i'll rock
give me a mic to light and competition will drop
fast or slow, i'll go and no one is gonna stop me yo
you must be kiddin', you swear you're gonna drop me no
well sure as battlin' is bad for your health
know you're confident my friend but don't fool yourself
my mic's a weapon, i'm steppin' with a capable rhyme
yo, your time for playin' is over you got your crew i got mine
not braggin', i'm bad and i could only get better
your girl came on to me she wanted me i wouldn't let her
don't make sense to come against me and my man ""d""
how it is, how it was, that's the way it'll be
but you still think you can beat me, huh, get it together
cause i'll never be beat, never be beat, never!!
stricly dope in the house, never be beat never be beat, ay roc man, check out the competition man
never be beat , never be beat"
"2pac
now of course i want peace on the streets but realistically painting perfect
pictures ain't never work my misery was so deep couldn't sleep through all my
pressures and my quest for cash i learned fast using violent measures memories
of adolescent years there was unity but after puberty we brought war to our
community so many bodies dropping it's got to stop i want to help but still i'm
stepping keeping my weapon must protect myself the promise of a better tomorrow
ain't never reach me plus my teachers were to petrified in class to teach me
sipping thunderbird and grape koolaid calling earl since my stomach was empty
it seduced me to f*** the world watch my little homies lose there childhoods to
guns nobody cries no more cause we all die for fun so why you ask me if i want
peace if you can't grant it n****s fighting across the whole planet so we can
never be peace will there ever be peace or are we all just headed for doom
still consumed by the peace and i'll know there'll never be peace that's why i
keep my pistol when i walk the streets cause there can never be peace
marvelouz
no time to rest they stressed out i can't remember the days my homies was here
now a days we live in fear the struggle's still here so now who's grabbing
their strap who's getting buck wild representing the generation of killers when
i was a child had many dreams but reality kept me and my homies stressing
trying to raise my baby girl to be the strongest know when i'm doing wrongest i
never had a bright day just drunkless smoking blunts and getting faded wishing
my partner made it if it was peace or just reciepts i know there will never be
all my tears were shed when i lost my homie number 3 it's getting harder to see
impossibility should we just face it can't get through the pain but still i
can't erase it so many trials and tribulations the things we facing wicked ways
can't see no brighter days it's time to chase it cross dreams cause the scene
is when you never get by that's why i got to stay high you'll never know when
you'll die my heart will never leave the ghetto i know to rise only in peace
that's why i say there ain't never going to be no peace and you know this and
be stressful
2pac

consumed by the peace and i'll know there'll never be peace that's why i keep
my pistol when i walk down the streets fool there'll never be peace
storm
living life lonely but i can't even cry cause visions of deception all around
me got my eyes full of despise who can i trust why even try they say the world
is mine but i know that's a lie living to die set up from birth steady dreaming
wishing for better days but all i see is demons close my eyes and reminiscence
of my childhood all i felt was pain from my arrival no memories of nothing nice
nothing but blinded reminders of my future life i'm freaking out i'm getting
closer to that other level will i be strong with game or just the heartless
devil i hope i'm able to find peace in me cause there's a storm 64 inches deep
in me and i try to do the right but it's the wrong things that seems to bring
me right back to this dirty game there'll never be peace f*** peace
2pac
will there ever be peace or are we all just headed for doom still consumed by
the peace and i'll know there'll never be peace that's why i keep my pistol
when i walk the streets fool there'll never be peace will there ever be peace
or are we all just headed for doom still consumed by the peace and i'll know
there'll never be peace that's why i keep my pistol when i walk the streets

equipped with automatic fire

"straight outta oakland, california where we spark it on ya
give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
i remember drinkin hennesey, smokin weed
fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
had a partner named snoop, loved to clown a stank
smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
shooting craps in the alley til they chased us off
pour a little for my homies but don't waste it all
oooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
on my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
having house parties in a crowded spot
and you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
lookin dumb, cause you waitin for your chance to hump
straight grindin, everybody havin fun
and it's cool til a fool pull a loaded gun
cause another dude kicked his bacardi over
he had to act a fool now the party's over
gun shots rang like it's thunder
and everybody bum rushing and i'm rushing to get a number
says she got a man but she's lying
why? i seen her talking to this other guy and..
he's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
i ain't trippin i just hope he get em, i got nuttin but love
singers 
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
2pac 
i'm down for yours, nuttin but
love
i love to go back, to the block i got my game from
cause uh, old man still drinkin, his breath still stinkin
he'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin
but i can't diss him he's my elder
he been livin here longer what that tell ya?
and little girls playin double dutch
still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
it's uhh, ponytails and barrettes
i gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
and little boys playin stick ball, quick y'all
get out the street before they hit y'all
and as i reminisce, i think about my ghetto bliss
and wonder how we came to this
i help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
i can't take what she offers me
and this is how the world could be
this is how the world should be
feels good to be back on the streets
cause i know they got love for me, nuttin but love
when i was young i used to want to be a dealer see
cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
i saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks
and the square's getting big for these sack of dope
started thinking bout a plan to get paid myself
so i made myself, raised myself
til the dealer on the block told me, ""that ain't cool
you ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool""
i got my game about women from a prostitute
and way back used to rap on the block for loot
i tryed to make my way legit, haha
but it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
and uhh, it was funny how i copped out
i couldn't make it in school, so finally i dropped out
my family on welfare
i'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care
i'm out here on my own
at least in jail i have a meal and i wouldn't be alone
i'm feelin like a waste, tears rollin down my face
cause my life is filled with hate
until i looked around me
i saw nothing but family, straight up down for me
panthers, pimps, pushers and thugs
hey yo, that's my family tree, i got nuttin but love
oaktown   
singers 
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
ain't got nuttin but love for ya "
"when i say to you that theres nothing else to do in my room
and when you say to me that theres really nothing else to do
then i'll get up and freakin walk around and try not to blink
then i'll get out of here and say that theres nothing to do
cuz when you tell me that we're gonna go out tonight
i dont think that everything will be alright
between everybody, between everything
between you and me and people that have nothing to do
i'll take a look inside that everything will be beside me
and i'll wonder why everyone is trying to hide me
like i'm not around and everything fell outta bounds
i'm sick of all the stupid sounds that sit around and try to annoy me
cuz when you tell me that we're gonna go out tonight
i dont think that everything will be alright
between everybody, between everything
between you and me and people that have nothing to do
well i guess this is the end
you know i cant comprehend
with everything that your trying to tell me
i dont think i can tolerate
any more of you today
this is all i have to say
cuz theres nothing to do
people that have nothing to do
people that have nothing to do
people that have nothing to do
people that have nothing to do"
"the only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
pray to my god everyday but he don't listen
the poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
listen i can hear her crying in the bedroom
praying for money we never think would she be dead soon
am i wrong for wishing i was somewhere else
**im** 13 can't feed myself
can i blame daddy 'cause he left me
wish he would've helped me
too much like him 'til my mama don't love me
on my own at a early age gettin' paid
and i'm strapped so i'll never be afraid
where did i go astray i'm hanging in the back streets
running with g's and dope fiends will they jack me?
can't turn back my eyes on the prize
i got nothing to lose
everybody gotta die
say good bye to the bad guy
that one you f***ed when you passed by
buck buck  from a glock
tempured glass fly
do or die walk a mile in my shoes
and you'd be crazy too
with nothing to lose
i got nothing to lose
got nothing to lose nothing to lose
i thank the lord for my many blessings
though i'm stressin' keep a vest for protection
from the barrel of the smith & wesson
and all my n****s in the pen'
here we go again
ain't nothing seperating us from a mack 10
born in the ghetto as a hustla older
straight soldier bucking at them bustas
no matter how you try n****s never die
we just retaliate with hate then we multiply
see me striking down the block hittin' co'ners
mobbin' like a muthaf***a livin' like i wanna
ain't no stoppin' at the red lights i'm sideways
thug life muthaf***a criiime pays
let the cops put they lights on
chase me n****
zig zaggin' through the freeway
race me n****
in a high speed chase with the law
the realest muthaf***a that you ever saw
i'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me
i'm high livin' like i ain't afraid to die
and you could walk a mile in my shoes
and you'd be crazy too
ain't no escape from a deadly fate
and everyday there's a million black bodies put away
i'm startin' to lose hope
it seems everybody's on dope
mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke
sometimes i choke on the indo
peepin' out the window alone on my own
i'm a criminal
got no love from the household i'm out cold
in the streets give me muthaf***ing peace
i got nothing to lose
and something to prove
what do i do live thug life n**** stay true
i wonder when they kill me
is there a heaven for a real g
lord forgive me if you feel me
'cause all my life i was dirt broke
with no hope li'l skinny muthaf***a wantin' dough
i hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
but everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
anyway it's so hard on a n**** in this city
no pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time
if you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too
with nothing to lose
it was a what type n**** be a thug life n****
we be the craziest...muthaf***a!
you know!
it was a what type n**** be a thug life n****
we be the craziest!"

"one day at a time lyrics
~tupac~
sometimes its hard, to wake up in the morning
mind full of demons.
i dont wanna hear em anymore.
got me heart broken, fine.
so many babies screaming because their seeing
destruction
before they see a human being.
so they start smoking weed
will never get our day.
until we learn to pray,
keep our families in shape.
cause they all broken
why? do ghetto birds die?
before we learn to fly?
somebody elses child
caught in gun smoke
& we, can all make a change
so i'm told, but i havent seen a change unfold
i keep open pleas
if you prefer to breathe
communties in need
of people that will lead
keep your eyes open
i, can only say i'll try
until the day i die
i promise to be wise
with my heart open
greed, brings only misery; a way to tragedy
so i stay sucka free.
only a few chosen, rise.
my ghetto queens, rise, dont be afraid to, try
to many of us die, for the daughters,open.
wise my brothers, be wise.
stay focus on the prize
though every dies.
~em~
if we can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
conrtol our mental state
settle down and set it straight.
maybe we can learn to take
a second to pump the brakes
before we set it, regret it later, and let is
escalate.
because by then its just to late
theres so much we can take
and theres only so much someone can swallow and
tolerate.
up to the point that he just breaks
snaps, and thats all it takes
you'd think that we was learning from other rappers
mistakes.
but we aint.
its great to go against.
with every artist comes an image he portrays
and a picture that he paints.
but in amidst of all this anger and these skanks
never did you hear me say i am a gangster, and i aint.
hear no complaints.
but i know that i will always continue to grow
as long as i lead and never follow no ones elses
shadow
there will never be another me
and that i can guarantee
thats why the f*** i remain sucker free, till this day
the game will never be the same
no matter how much fame or success they obtain
there will never be another me
and no matter what they do
there will never be another you
you can search but you will never find
you can try to rewind time
but in your hearts and your minds
we will never die, we are forever alive.
and we can continue growing
 one day at a time.
~?????~
dont get caught up in publicity and caught in the hype
rappers are regular people minus money and lights
searching for fortune and fame and super stardom
all the jewelry, all the cars.
who's crews the hardest?
now the hiphop police, them fellas is watchin
and the kids think beef is the only option
outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
my memories reason to die, makaveli lives on
they think the industy is fun, aint no pity with guns
and when your money is up thats when you enemies come
so if he died and came back would he try to save rap
we needin a change this drama remains
i spent my whole life fighting myself
that, i cant win, so i'm inviting some help
????????????????????????
i take rights from the left
i'm still just like a kid looking for stripes on my
belt
and that there is a fight in itself
so i just pray and hope god, take a light to myself
no matter how much i try, stay alive,
i'ma die a man and still standin in the love of my
pride
frivolous beef, we past that
i'm trying to keep someone from come,coming in
and collect on my ass, cap.
rappers in the game aint change
and i finally realized that we not in the same game
the hating, the ??? so i guess i'll deal with it
them 4,5 a pop killas, yes, i'm still with it
the streets is military you gotta be a solider,
gotta stay lery and keep your eyes on the road
they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold
so we got to do what we got to do to keep it growing
one day at a time, keep the faith in your mind,
and we continue growing
one day at a time"

"psst, ay yo, are you afraid to die?
or do you wanna live forever?
tell me
what's wrong?
they wanna bury me
i'm worried
i'm losing my mind
look down the barrel of my nine
and my vision is blurry
falling to pieces, am i guilty?
i pray to the lord, but he ignores me
unfortunately, because i'm guilty
show me a miracle, i'm hopeless
i'm choking on marijuana smoke
with every toke is
like i'm losing focus
falling asleep while i'm in service
when will i die?
forever, paranoid nervous
because i'm high
don't mention funerals, i'm stressing, and going nutty,
and remincing about the n****s that murdered my buddy
i wonder when will i be happy
ain't nothing funny
flashbacks of busting caps
anything for money
where am i going, i've discovered
can't understand
why my next door nieghbor is having carloads of undercovers
what a suprise in the mailbox
hope she get it
happy birthday b****, you know you shouldn't of did it
everybodies dying, am i next
who can i trust?
will they be g's and look at me
before they bust
or will they kill me while i'm sleeping
two to the head
while i'm in bed, leaking
blood on my satin sheets
is there a heaven for a baller?
gettin' susipicious of this b****
the line is busy everytime i call her
now she's telling me to visit
who else is home?
i check the house before i bone
so we alone
after i nut
i hit the highway, see ya later
to all the playas, watched her fly way
a n**** played her
b**** is telling all her homies
that i can f*** her like no other
and now other b****es wanna bone me
i'm under pressure, getting drunk
somebody help me
i drank a fifth of hennessey
i don't think its healthy
i see my enemies they creeping
don't make me blast
i watch the 5 0 roll, the mutha f***as pass
nod me like they know me
smiling as they laugh
i put up my middle finger, then i dash
n****s don't like me cuz i'm thugging
and everyday, i'm a hustler
looking to get paid
they wanna bury me, i'm worried
no need to lie
i pray to god
i won't scream when its time to fry
no where to rest
i'm losing homies
ain't that a b****
when i was rich i had clout
now a n****s lonely
i put the pistol to my head
and say a pray
i see visions of me dead
lord are you there
they tell me i'm lost, cuz i'm lonely
i thought i had friends
but in the end
a n**** dies lonely
no where to run
i'm in terror
and no one cares
a close casket at my funeral
but no one is there
is there a future for a killer
i change my ways
but still that don't promise me the next day
so i stay thugging with a passion
forever blasting
i'm busting on you mutha f***as when i mash
they wonder if i'm hell bound
well hell can't be worse than this
cuz i'm in hell now
don't make me hurt you
i don't want to, but i will
i've seen mutha f***as killed over blown deals
never will i die, i'll be back
re incarnated as a mutha f***ing mac
eleven, cuz in heaven
there's no shortage on g's
i'm telling you now
you mutha f***as don't know me..."
"intro: 2pac
only god can judge me, is that right?
 only god can judge me now
only god baby, nobody else, nobody else
all you other motherf***ers get out my business
verse one: 2pac
perhaps i was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
i couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
will i, succeed, paranoid from the weed
and hocus pocus try to focus but i can't see
and in my mind i'ma blind man doin time
look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
i've been trapped since birth, cautious, cause i'm cursed
and fantasies of my family, in a hearse
and they say it's the white man i should fear
but, it's my own kind doin all the killin here
i can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
jealousy inside, make em wish i died
oh my lord, tell me what i'm livin for
everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
and all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
and everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
cause the media is full of dirty tricks
only god can judge me
chorus: 2pac
 only god can judge me
that's right baby, yeah baby
 only god
hahahahahahahaha
 only god can judge me, only god can judge
 me, only god
only god can judge me
 only god can judge me
and only god can
 only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me
 only god can judge me
only god can judge me
 only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me
 only god can judge me now
*heart monitor: long beep*
flatline!
verse two: 2pac
i hear the doctor standing over me *heart monitor: beeping slowly*
screamin i can make it
got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked
still i, can't breathe, somethings evil in my iv
cause everytime i breathe, i think they killin me *beeping sound stops*
i'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies
i wake up stranglin, danglin my bed sheets
i call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
how did it come to this? i wish they didn't miss
somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
cause even thugs cry, but do the lord care?
try to remember, but it hurts
i'm walkin through the cemetary talkin to the, dirt
i'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
there's a ghetto up in heaven and it's ours, black power
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
and our fate, is a lifetime of hate
dear mama, can you save me? and f*** peace
cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
no more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
and they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped
mista, po lice, please try to see that it's
a million motherf***ers stressin just like me
only god can judge me
chorus w/ variations
interlude: 2pac
that which does not kill me can only make me stronger
and i don't see why everybody feel as though
that they gotta tell me how to live my life
let me live baby, let me live
verse three: rappin 4 tay, tupac
pac i feel ya, keep servin it on the reala
for instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
would you be wrong, for buckin a n**** to the pavement?
he gon' get me first, if i don't get him fool start prayin
ain't no such thing as self defense in the court of law
so judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin a cross, that's real
got him, lurked him, crept the f*** up on him
sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
after talkin behind my back like a b**** would
tellin them n****z, ""you can fade him""; punk i wish you would
it be them same motherf***ers in your face that'll rush up in your place
to get your safe, knowin you on that paper chase
grass, glass, big screen and leather couch

b****, remember tupac and 4 tay
them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the bay
pac when you was locked down, that's when i'll be around
start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
that's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
don't think i don't see you haters, i know you all in disguise
interlude: 2pac
guess you figure you know me cause i'm a thug
that love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz

everybody talking 'bout pac's life
started with five shots, n****s plotting to kill him
never figured that, that same n**** sell five million
hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits
court cases got a n**** facing multiple digits
dodging cop cars look how we come so far
picture a high school drop out
rolling a double r
house full of happiness, weed and drank
way out
so when trouble tried to find me can't
never visioned living longer than my twenty first
thought i'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
and though it hurts to see the change
it comes with the fame
watch them gossip in this silly game
to all the motherf***er's speaking down on me this is the night
why's everybody caught up in pac's life?
to all y'all n****s
conversating on my life

talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
and so i pull it out my pocket let it rain you see

death before dishonour never talk to undercover's
live by the same rules so i minus the tattoo's
with the same sort of dude with he same short fuse
i want money in large amounts
my garage full of cars that bounce
moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts
busters is jealous and half these n****s is punks

"tupac:
as real as it seems the american dream
ainâ€™t nuthinâ€™ but anotha calculated scheme
to keep us locked up and shot up and back in chains
to deny us our future rob our name
kept our history a mystery but now i see
the american dream wasnâ€™t meant for me
â€˜cause lady libertyâ€™s a hypocrite she lied to me
promised freedom education and ecuality
never gave be nuthinâ€™ but slavery
but now look at how dangerous you made me
callinâ€™ me a man â€˜cause iâ€™m strong and bold
with this gumbo of knowledge of the lies you told
promised me emancipation and a free nation
all you ever gave my people was starvation
the father of our country never cared for me
they kept our ancestors shacked up in slavery
uncle sam neva did a damm thing for me
exept lie about the facts in my history
now iâ€™m sittinâ€™ here mad â€˜cause iâ€™m unemployed
but the government mad cause they enjoy
when my people are down they just screw us around
time to change the government now
panther power
ray:
panther powr from the place that resides within
go to for to with a panther and you just canâ€™t win
self proclaimed best supress the rest
the rich get richer and the poor take less
the american dream was the american nightmare
you kept my people down and refused to fight fair
the ku klux klan tried to keep us out
with signs that state ""no blacks allowed""
with intimidation and segregation
once would wait for our freedom
but now weâ€™re impatient
blacks they others they yell sell out
freedom equality get out yell out
donâ€™t eva be ashamed of what you are
itâ€™s your panther power that makes you a star
panther power
tupac:
my mother neva let me forget my history
hopinâ€™ that i would set free cahins that were put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know tha true facts about my history
i couldnâ€™t settle for beinâ€™ a statistic
couldnâ€™t survive in this capitalistic government
â€˜cause it was meant to hold us back with ignorance
drugs and sneak attacks in my community
they killed our unity
but when i charged them they cried immunity
i strike america like a case of heart disease
panther power is runninâ€™ through my arteries
try to stop me homeboy youâ€™ll get clawed to death
â€˜cause iâ€™ll be fightin for my freedom â€˜till my dyinâ€™ breath
ray:
do you remember thatâ€™s what iâ€™m askinâ€™ you
you think youâ€™re livinâ€™ free donâ€™t make me laugh at you
open your eyes realise youâ€™ve been locked in chains
said you wasnâ€™t civilized and stole your name
â€˜cause some time has passed we seem to all firget
thereâ€™s no liberty for me and you we ainâ€™t free yet

"daddy's home...
so...you say that like it means somethin to me
you've been gone a mighty long muthaf***in time
for you to be comin home talkin that 'daddy's home' shit
we been getting along fine just without you
me, my brother, and my mother
so if you don't mind, you can step the f*** off, pops
f*** you!
had to play catch by myself
what a sorry sight
a pitiful plight
so i pray for a starry night
please send me a pops before puberty
the things i would do to see a piece of family unity
moms always work, i barely see her
i'm startin to get worried without a pops i'll grow to beat her
it's a wonder they don't understand kids today
so when i pray, i pray i'll never grow to be that way
and i hope that he answers me
i heard, god don't like ugly
take a look at my family
a different father every weekend
before we get to meet him they breakup before the week ends
i'm gettin sick of all the friendships
as soon as we kick it, he done split
and then the whole trip ends quick
how can i be a man if there's no role model
i'm strivin to save my soul i stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
i'm so sorry...
i'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time
for all this time
moms had to entertain many men
didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
i'm gettin a bit older and i'm startin to be a bother
moms can't stand me cause i'm lookin like my father
shall i stay or run away
tell me tha answer
moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
moms was tough cause it's poppa wasn't man enough
couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
instead of takin care of me
he'd rather live lavishly
that's why i'll never be a father
unless you got the time
it's a crime
don't even bother
that's when i started hatin' the phony smiles
said i was an only child
it's hard for a son to see his mother cry
she only loves you, but has to f*** with these other guys
i'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time
for all this time
man child in the promised land
couldn't form many heroes
moms was there only when pops was a no show
and oh
i guess ya didn't know that i would grow to be so strong
lookin kinda pale was it the ale that pops was wrong
where was the money that you sent you would send me
talked on the phone and ya sounded so friendly
ask about school and my welfare
but it's clear, you ain't sincere
hey, who the hell cares
you think i'm blind but this time i see ya comin, jack
you left up broke, grabbed your coat
now ain't no runnin back
ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
so don't even start with that 'wanna be your father' shit
don't even bother with your dollars i don't need it
i'll bury moms like you left me all alone g
now that that i finally found you,
stay the f*** away from me
i'm so sorry...
i'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time
for all this time
i never meant to leave but i was wanted
crossed too many people every house ran to was haunted
had to watch for strangers
every brother was in danger
if i wanted keep you breathin
had to be out of range, then
had to move one, lost my name and picked a number
baby watch my back i had no happy home to run ta
maybe it's my fault for being a father living fast
but livin slow, we'd have no dough, low to kissing ass
in hiensight showed me it was wrong all along
i wanted to make some dough so you could grow to be so strong
it took a little longer than i thought
i slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
now i'm doin time and i wish you'd understand
all i ever wanted was for you to be a man
and grow to be the type you was meant to be
keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
i'm so sorry...
i'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time

and have your mouth blown off by saying f*** the law
if you do not know why i'm crazy, go back in time
what does a black have to do to gain respect?
sometimes i think i'm being tested
and if i say no, more a black jail
that's why i keep testing
always with my vest in case of police officers to get on my feet
i give my rolés out there, ready to light a joint
but since my life is shit, some say i'm half crazy
pow pow is the sound i make when i walk out there
other crazy when watching a sucker shoots, huh
they have the black one killer here, before i was a drug dealer
but they want to see who is more true
now the same motherf***ers want to kill me

i need supplies, so do what i do
and do not talk shit to be in my place
there was no other destiny to choose
i have nothing left, so i'm singing the blues of black
my dad needs new shoes, but what can i do?
my little boy needs to eat
why do i need to steal my man
to live as well as the rockefeller?
and have you ever stopped to think
i am old enough to go to war, but not to drink
the police want to sue me, huh
i know you love my look ""i want to f***""
make your rules, i'll break them
no matter how many you do, show me the skunk i caught them
so never try to test me
my pockets are empty

i do not care about your language or how you live
you are considered by the brothers in my area
do you have problems with the f***ing police?
do not run these suckers, come take a 12 gauge me
we are not free, i would be miserable if i misled
by a white b****, blonde, blue eyed
and the black with the cell phone, left her baby at home
for him to go out and take off a f***, huh

i bet in the event of my demise
i will finally realize
and it appeared clear to me
that clearly, 'pac was truly meant to be
when i saw the rose grow out the crack

poetry has a beat like no other
words of inspiration, you can share with another
it breathes and lives with a life of passion
who cares the style, is always in fashion
the topics are endless, and so are the meanings
the sparks that strike, bring so many feelings
it's in the way i drag my s'sss
and drop my g's
that has you so in love with me
or should i say my poetry
the chemistry is so in sync
envy in will drive your crazy and quake your nerves
but you thought these were only words?
no it's my soul that's creepin up your back
my spirit with yours, is what you lack
but yet you still fail to understand me

yeah i can see that you want me
by the way that you smile
are you still down for me
jon b.
left once again at home
another noght on your own
ain't no fun in loving
if you're loving alone
how does it feel to be useless
oh no can you recall how
close we use to be then
can you still remember those feelings again
seems like everytime i see you
there's a tear in your eye
time to make some decisions
or go dying inside
tupac
tell'em all call me a fool
but i'm stuck in this love thang
plus i'm overheatin' from the rush
our tongues touch
kissin feelin fireworks
watch the sky
i make you smile
but you'd rather have
what makes you cry
say goodbye and leave now
with my heart on my sleeve
memories what i found is you
still care  you had feelings
and they're still there baby
girl keep it real here
are you still down
chorus

jon b.
remember that evening
i knew that you were too scared
to go all the way
but you did it to please me
crying it was raining
when you gave it to me
the more i see you
the more that i feel inside
and i know one day
you'll make it back
to where you can fly
 go don't cry
tommorow brings better days
let me dry your eyes
take your burdens away
tupac
only once in a lifetime
touch my soul
baby boo don't rush the flow
got me all weak baby
but i'm strong in parts
more bounce to the ounce
with the longest sparks
gettin' mine like fine wine
measured in time
many other brothers loved you
but the pleasure was mine
mama taught me how
to love a woman properly sprung
we committed so i hit it
so it's properly done
are you still down?
chorus
girl it's alright now
cause it's there in your eyes
yeah i can see that you want me
by the way that you smile
are you still down for me"
"r u still down 
now up and at em it's on, i was raised to be strong
and mama told me be a thug since the day i was born
i came up, out the gutter never changed my style
got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
and the fame was a plot to try to change me
and what's strange is nobody knew my name 'fore it came
now the whole world is calling me a, killer
all i ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
all the time i was ballin, never heard my friends callin
couldn't stop myself from fallin, i'm all in
shit's gettin sleazy, believe me
best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
cause in my mind, i see sunshine, i thought
i didn't have to run, now i'm duckin from the gun yellin, 'one time'
take your time to feel my record, and if you did
chill a second, my blind method, will still wreck it
my young homies stay strong
i wonder if they'll listen to a n**** when he gone, r u still down?
 x5
raise em up... r u still down?
i'm gettin high, so a n**** think he touch the sky
turn tough inside, in the rush to die
livin life as a thug time to face the truth
what's goin on with the wasted youth, please god
come and save me , had to work with what ya gave me
and got a n**** goin crazy
i can't read the signs, i'm blind, but a n**** know
he need his nine, cause times, they ain't what they used to be
ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
and my n****z on the streets, man listen
cause these ain't the old days
ain't no way i'ma bustin my ass and gettin no pay
it seems i can't find my focus, and homey i ain't paranoid
i seen the future and it's hopeless
lord knows, its hard on a young scrub
it seems i had less problems when i slung drugs
but since i'm tryin lace n****z with the game
wanna see me locked in chains, tryin to dirty up my name
and them same motherf***ers that was callin me
will be the first to turn their backs, when i'm fallin, see
i should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
this one n**** got the town in fear, but r u still down
i wrote this for my critics and my, enemies
last year ya used to love me, huh remember me
now ya hate me with a passion, tryin to get me stuck in the mix
i'm stayin sharp, got no time for them tricks
and now they wonder if i'm goin to jail
just as well, cause my life on the streets   a living hell
and i can't sleep, they got my phone tapped, and mercy lord
come get me 'fore they hurt me
ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
my daddy left me alone, and so i'm angry
i never did nothin wrong, my mama told me, ""baby it's on""
and now i'm hustlin and bustlin bones
never said it came easy, i'm makin cheese
buyin all the things on tv, and gettin skeezed

"rebel, rebel, rebel
they just can't stand the reign
or the occasional pain
of a man like me who goes against the grain.
sometimes i do it in vain
so wit the little bass and treble ain't missed a
so it's time for me to explain that i'm the rebel.
cold as the devil.
straight from the underground, the rebel alone laughs.
they came to see the maniac sychopath.
the critics heard of me and the aftermath.
i don't give a damn and it shows.
a when i do a stage show i wear street clothes.
so they all know me: the lyrical lunatic, the maniac mc.
i give a shout out to your homies.
maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, g.
on the streets or on tv, it just don't pay the be a truth tellin mc.
they won't be happy till i'm banned.
the most dangerous weapon: an educated black man.
for point blank in your face, pump up the bass, and join the human
race.
i throw peace to the bay.
cuz from the jungle to oaktown, they backin me up all the way.
you know ya gotta love the sound.
it's from the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
he's the rebel: rebel of the underground
now i'm face to face with the devil.
cuz they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto.
and police brutality,
put you in a nip and call it technicality.
so you reap what you soe.
so read the wrath of the rebel jackin em up once more.
now the fox is in the henhouse.
creepin up on your daughter, while you asleep
i got her sneakin out.
tupac ain't nuttin nice.
i'll be nothin how i wanna and do it when i'm gonna.
now i'm up to no good.

so sit and slip into the sound.
peep the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
he's the rebel: rebel of the underground
they say they hate me, they wanna hold me down.
i guess they scared of the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
but i never let it get me.
i just make another record 'bout the punks tryin to sweat me.
in fact, they tryin to keep me out.
try to censor what i say cuz they don't like what i'm talkin 'bout.
so what's wrong with the media today.
got brothers sellin out cuz they greedy to get paid.
but me, i'm comin from the soul.
and if it don't go gold, my story still get told.
and that way they can't stop me.
and if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy.
it's sloppy, don't even try to.
i'm a slave to the rythm and
i'm about to fly through.
sold yo to the people in the ghetto.
when ya hear the bass roll, go ahead and let go.
now everybody wanna gangbang.
they talkin street slang, but the punk still can't hang.
by makin records bout violence
but when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent.
it kinda make you wanna think about
that ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out.

"is reincarnation
reach the whole nation
me murderer?
my only fear of death is reincarnation
uh
my only fear of death, is reincarnation
i use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
how can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
this composition be my prophecy i hope it's heard
hard words is spoken, many promises broken as if it's
useless to hope, they got me constantly smoking
my role model was a cold bottle of o. e
surrounded by my closest homies but nobody knows me
i pray to god it ain't easy
half the cops in california got a hard on to squeeze me
running through the backstreets, hopping over fences tryna shake the
f***ing k 9s, running around senseless
i'll probably be a mystery to many, but a legend to some
i've been a man for many women, but a husband for none
in case you see me out in traffic, looking nervous and high
my hands, holding my pistols will they serve us or die?
may god forgive me for my crooked ways, i didn't mean it
knew i'd fall in love with money the first day that i seen it
maybe now they can understand, my occupation
it's clear that my only fear of death is reincarnation
i keep my shit on safety
i've been shooting rocks lately
everybody dies, they nickel plates don't penetrate me
i was suppose' to be the murder first to go
them n****s missed, grazed my wrist, i took it personal
kato told me that i was slipping
got his strap and started tripping
slipped two clips on the
table, twist an l and said ""fatal listen""
everybody don't be missing keep your vest on baby
and you know that shit that happens to the teflon, crazy
you ain't gotta pack a gat i got your back just keep your front line
or we can stall that, from the cadillac we buck the gun shots
but we locked down, don't have your back in the casket
all he thought about was plastic and murdering bastards
i spend my days and nights
not knowing if a stray's in flight
they'll probably catch me
leaving my foes hella' happy
cause look, at any moment
the game could be my main opponent
n****s be swimming where the sharks are and man they don't even know it
but i stay focused, concentrate on my surroundings
cause if i'm slipping, well that's when n****s will get to clowning
and i can't have it, i got a mission to complete
raise my kids upright, make sure they got something to eat
and my daily ritual is, protect my physical biz
i just can't see now, i choose death before the penal
cause what good am i? to that little n**** with them big eyes
if i'm incarcerated, feel me now, i gots to make it
and if i don't, re reincarnation ain't an option
leave my ass dead until it's really poppin'
how can y'all call us murderers and shit and
blame all the problems of the world on us young thugs, thug n****s from the streets, ain't that a b****
tell me y'all ain't giving a f*** about us when we was broke and poor
how come when we get a little money, motherf***ers wanna stop us and block us
what part of the game is that? who should we love, who should we believe in when the motherf***ers that's supposed to be our role models, supposed to be the people we look up to is tryna snatch us out of the game
what type of shit is that? f*** 'em all
i still whizz for the top dolla'
just a true thug, with a comma
high power, small drama, made n****s
top drazed with a mean way to play 'em
these days, homie i'm saying though, they tryna play me
i gots to get them, hit em and lay low
i told you before, my, only fear of death is momma, crying for help and papa tryin' to help
when i know we ain't got it but shit i gots to handle it, it's hard
they hand it to me, snitches, suspicious b**** n****s who ain't insanity
never worry

"resist the temptation of the beast,
you'll slip and loose your grip
and forever fall a sleep.
the venom is contagious, beware of its spell
what you thought would be heaven, turn's out to be hell.
i wonder if she knows the devils taken off her clothes, deep into her soul
slow, now he's in control.
poppas doing worse, a victim of the deadly curse
wouldn't be the first to leave the ghetto in a hurse,and oh how it hurts.
the children pay the biggest price,
never get the chance to grow up with a happy life.
blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap
someone's at the top supplying us with much crack.
keep them in a daze,don't let them see the other way
let'em all get paid,wont live to see another day.
see they never got a breath of the sunshine,
now the kids addicted and only hit it one time.
we are destined to be dead as a nation,
don't let it come to this, resist the temptation.
gamble for your soul with the devil
you wonder how low can you go, before you reach the lowest level.
as everybody sits and stares,
there's no use looking in you eyes cause there isn't anybody there.
and though it may make you wanna cry,
got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why.
i guess you think they will understand,
you feel cold, cause you sold your soul to the dopeman.
now there's no turning back, in fact
it's decided that would live and die for the crack.
you got no friends cause you cheated them all,
you feel lonely,low,defeated and small.
no one was there when i took the wrong path,
and nobody cared if i died in a blood bath.
but is this my destiny?
tell the lord they got my mind, but he can have the rest of me.
cause i'm ready to end it all,
one bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all.
i didn't mean to be a bother,
a failure as a son, a husband and a father.
i wish i could turn back the time,
go back and let it find why i let it crack my mind.
and my only explanation, it came to this
resist the temptation."
"you know what gang violence is, mostly
and the people dont want you to hear this

the struggle continues
now if we do want to live a thug life and a gangsta life and all of that,
ok, so stop being cowards and lets have a revolution

"yeah! ha ha yeah.... thats right!
the f.a's comin striaght from the wild wild west
look at baby girl born in 19 7 deuce
pop's on his fix, mom's stuck on that crazy juice
went to school, it's all cool but in junior hiiigh
little hooker in the bathroom getting hiiigh
what she doing and what she smoking, nobody knows
is she addicted or just slipping into melbose
a bad ass broad running with the girl gang
just got some tat's,talking all that girl slang.
first one to slap, because la vida dont matter
wip out a cuete watch your brains get splattered
selling them doves, hanging with thugs and all that
beating up fools with a baseball bat
started having sex at only 15
imagine o.g. wears his clothes all crisp and clean
got pregnant had a baby in december
she wont see the daddy till next september
mom's and pop's gave her the boot
kicked her out la casa, now what raza
with the money she got, she bought a spot of the block
started paying the rent by slangin' phat ass coca rocks
now shes 23 her four kids all alone, and loc'ed out
and plus shes all smoked out,the base face
you could see it in her eyes, it could also tell the tears
ofa life long cries.
they was headed for self destruction
conjunction junction, whats your function?
her own kids gotta healp, “cause they knew she was slippin'
took the devil away homegiiirl, you was slippin'.
chorus:
slipping into darkness
when you slip you trip and fall
slipping into darkness
ain't no sense to give ya'll no love at all
they say we're slipping, as a whole one race
so, what we gonna choose, don't want the blues
i turn to the news and what do i see
""everybody in the world ready to d. i. e.""
we got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
whites against whites,from governments to undergrounds
so, peep the soundas it bumps through your stereo
ear to your brain now check out the scenerio
cali got quakes, mudslides, and floods
pesadillascrips and bloods
hustlas, pimps, shot callers, and killas
o.g. , macks, and the big coca dealers
we got homeboys who just like kicking it
and vato's like me who grab the mic and start splitting it
 ""you're in for a phat treat trip into a phat beat""
so get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat.
chorus x2
they wanna band me cause a brothas makin noise a lot
ill shoot they ass in a sec wit a poisin dart
they got me runnin down the street gettin hotter
runnin from the cops as i try to clock my glock
the war wont stop
thats why they wanna band the music
you ever notcie how the cops cant stand the music
see a black man coolin wit a mexican
we can all have peace, the sun sets again
they try to shove us in the pen
but we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
once again, its your friend outta oakland,hopin
to keep the hip hop clubs open
now we can lay back and let them close'm
or we can have beef and show that we control'em
now aint nobody gettin paid, its a damn shame
why gang bang brothas in the same gang?
they say securitys to blame, cause they lettin it off
brothas come to have fun but they settin it off
one time, make it worse when they sweat us
send an army of pigs to come get us
now im runnin outta time and im cool down with the aztecs
this is sorta like soul food"

in pictures
why shed tears? save your sympathy
my childhood years were spent buryin' my peers
in the cemetary

to breathe
if you believe then you can achieve

have you ever seen a n**** who was strong in the game
overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
look back on childhood memories and i'm still
feelin' the pain
turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
to many hassles in my local life, survivin'
the strain
and a man without a focus, life could drive him
insane
stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
but when i focus on reality we broke and in chains
had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big

blessin' the child
all my momma gots to do now is collect it and

inhalin' sherm smoke, visualized the flames
will i be smothered by my own pain?
strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick
to dis us
takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes
they'd get us
hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive
my sins
since i ain't in many penitenturies the best
revenge is f*** friends
we military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
tryin' to find jehovah to help me
somebody save me
lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin'
i ain't cursed my babies
maybe now n****s feel me now, picture my pain
embrace my words make the world change
and still i smile n****
and now a moment of silence, let us pray
and as you journey into outerspace
may the angels help to lead the way
shine up on your soul to keep you safe
and all the homies that done passed away
they there to greet you as you pass the gates
and as you headed to the tunnel's light
i hope it leads to eternal life

i lost so many peers, shed so many tears
now i'm lost and i'm weary
so many tears, i'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
my every move is a calculated step
ta bring me closer
to embrace an early death now there's nothing left
there was no mercy on tha streets
i couldn't rest
i'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screaming peace
and though my soul was deleted, i couldn't see it
i had my mind full of deamons tryin' ta break free
they planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
in my brain like a match, such a dirty game
no memories, just misery
painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
will i survive till' tha morning ta see tha sun
please lord forgive me for my sins
cause here i come...
chorus
lord
i suffer through tha years
and shed so many tears
lord
i lost so many peers, shed so many tears
lord knows i've tried, been a witness ta homicide
drive bys taken lives, little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
broken hearted as i glance at tha chaulk line, gettin' high
this ain't tha life for me
i wanna change
but ain't no future right for me
i'm stuck in tha game
i'm trapped inside a maze
see this tangaray influenced me ta gettin crazy
disillusioned lately
i've been really wanting babies
so i could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
don't trust my lady
cause she's a product of this poison, i'm hearen noises
think she's f***en with my boys, can't take no more
i'm fallin' to tha floor
beggin' for tha lord ta let me in ta heavens door
i shed so many tears...
chorus
lord
i lost so many peers
and shed so many tears
i lost so many peers, shed so many tears
fades...
i suffered through tha years and shed so many tears"

they flow with life, and take no form
ah the world moves fast
and it would rather pass you on by
than to stop and see what makes you cry
it's painful, so sad, sometimes i cry
but no one really cares..
to ask why, why, why
well i cry because my heart is torn
i find it hard to carry on
and if i had an ear to confide in
i would cry amongst my treasured friends
a but who do you know that stops that long
to help another carry on

stuck inside this maxed pin,
tryin' to pay me debt, for all my sins...
see, these penatentary times be so heavy on my mind,
at times it's like i'm livin' just to die...
i'm livin' in hell, stuck in my jail cell,
stranded in the county jail,
waitin' for my chance to post bail...
i wanna be paid in large macks ,
and mash and flash flags ,
i blast and wonder how long will i last...
my memories fade when i'm intoxicated, buster are shady,
so i'm dumpin' on cowards crazy when ever faded...
i know i said it all before, but now i mean it,
visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear i seen it...
even tho' you mad at me,
you'll be glad to see the stragedy of makin' these chips come so easily...
i max out in the morning, baby life is good,
me and you against the whole hood...
soon as i come home...
grab my strap, locate my comrades,
lets get my enemies not knowin' i'm comin' back,
go get the money out the safe,
it's time to turn the streets into a war zone,
soon as i get home...
sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin',
but now you out in the world, while i'm twistin in prison...
love letters come daily, words of affection, you send me money,
and new n****s beggin' for some sexin...
stay wide open, keep yo eyes pilled,
and my advice is keep it real or you can die squillin'...
plus i never had to worry 'bout a visit, cause you did daily,
guard tryin' to get ya number, you don't dare tell me...
tongue kissin', steady humpin',
tryin to touch up something,
before the c o in the corner jump in, sprungin'...
late night reminicin', everybodys quiet,
i think somethings in the air, prepare for the riot...
it's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed dreams, i touch 'em with thug love,
and then let they hate bring, the start of a war, but now i'm gone,
release me to the streets in the morning, it's on,
soon as i get home...
grab my gats, locate my comrades,
lets get my enemies not knowin' i'm comin' back,
lets get the money out the safe,
it's time to turn the streets into a war zone,
soon as i get home...
think all my whole lifes been like a game of cee low,
thinkin' big like they keep to me no feelings, my dreams like nino...
brown the whole town be shook up,
and me and momma survived the pick up,
how many rocks i made to cook up...
narcotics got traffic, seen those n****s you blasted,
wantin' me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic...
yeah n**** i heard you, lil' moo gave the word,
you get paroled on the 3rd, you sold love, we out here frontin'...
still here but all about nothing, but double o's is
what i'm wantin', and i'm tryin' to say something, that we ain't never had...
luxuery life, results livin' bad, tricks of the trade,
shit that should've been taught by dad...
but learn, do the crew, lessons between me and you,
and once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do...
meanwhile i stay waitin' by the phone,
hopin' i'll get a call tellin' a n**** that you home...
 x2
grab my gats, locate my comrades,
lets get my enemies not knowin' i'm comin' back,
lets get the money out the safe,
it's time to turn the streets into a war zone,

counting pennys over tha years

put ta rest
by a brotha who was hopeless
grow up broke on tha rope of insanity

i was framed
so don't make the same mistake, n****
you gotta learn how to shake the snakes, n****
cause the police love to break a n****
send em upstate cause they straight up hate the n****s
so what i do is get a crew of zoo n****s
straight fools into rules and do n****s
and one time had enough of me
i'm still raw so the law can't f*** with me
they wanna send me to the pen, punk picture that
i stay strapped muthaf***as better get your gat
it ain't easy bein me i can't take it
life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
and ever since the movies
ho's try to do me
if they can't screw me
they find a way to sue me
now can you picture me coolin at a night club
somethin for love, but muthaf***as want a beamer
since i wear a lot of gold
they plot
don't no what i got if ya stop
with the hot ones
and all yeah, i wanna feel guilty
but you punk muthaf***as tried to milk me
you'll get stacked behind the hill
with my phone or my pager
just beat me while i cut you with my razor
i'm not violent, i'm petrified and nervous
i got no mercy for these n****s try'n to serve us
but if you catch me outta pocket, then i'm got
you love to shoot a n**** but you scared to pop a cop
now drop
reflected and disrespected
why so rejected ?
our just another rapper
who swears he's makin records
that's what the'd said
whenever i would walk by
i never tripped, though
always kept my head up high
eventually, i knew that i would find my way
after the darkest night always comes a brighter day
and some will say
that turned away is all you'll get
i just say ""bet""
and never let em see me sweat
cause in the end
i knew that i would have it all
while non believers were prayin for my downfall
and some would call and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart, i'm knowin that they wish me hell
yo get a real job. rappin doesn't pay the rent
i hate the studio cause that's where all my money went
never surrender, it's all about the faith you got
don't ever stop, just push it til you hit the top
and if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
be true to you, and that way you can never fall
but beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
and when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
and there you are, can't even pay your car, nope
and when you reminisce thinkin how you got dissed
remember how it fealt and do remember this
be true to you
for me that there's no one bigger
cause they can all suck d***
cause strictly 4 my n****z
this is for the critics if you live up
pick up my shit or i'll be back doin stickups
i better see five stars next to my picture
if not, tupac will cop the glock and come knockin and getcha
i told you once muthaf***a hold the nut
play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin when you're f***ed
n****s know what's up but they be try'n to hold me down
i'm comin outta oaktown, b**** f*** around
and it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
n**** it's the way you throw the ?fangs? in the war
and to the marks that be talkin all that shit
screamin out the next n****'s name like a b****
and the n****s that i ran into recently
the muthaf***as at the club that pulled the piece on me
you little b****es should've pulled the f***in trigga
now you live in fear of a heartless ass n****
?mr. trump?
n****s tried to play me with the gat
but like terminator, n****, i'll be back
and i'll be back with a f***in army
you tried to harm me cause most muthaf***as try to act up without they're backup,
when they get jacked up they crack up
it's strictly 4 my n****z at the show
so they know not to play me like a ho
strictly 4 my..."

my enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
but that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll
never be peace long as there's fiends on these cali streets
even on the other side brothers die, but ride
n****z get high off a slow form of suicide
hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
i live my life to f***in mo', exposin tragically
how can we find some peace and n****z still ain't get a piece

out to get all of it, but i'll never loose my balls and shit
and it's all for the pressure
that'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser

they get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
please beware we thugs revolution size
criminals dare be last mental me intitutionalize
locked down, got many shell shocked, now
holdin down fort like i'm stuck in court cell block style
yo i been loosin sleep, stay awake way past late
visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
as i lay here gatted down and tatted
knowin now it's hard to slow down for a addict
it's been years of stugglin, guzzlin beers
beefin and never even, ain't no love in the air
and i suffer my shit in hell, talkin to the heavens
walkin thru the valley of death with my fellas
i lost a lot, startin with hope i tried
and for every tattoo i got a moment i cried
i'm thru with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
step in my shoes, nuttin to lose, but my brain
i'ma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
ain't nothing to fear, cryin these tattooed tears

it's like all we got left   teardrops and closed caskets
tell me how you feel homey
you recollects and see how crazy it sounds
the whole town's on a mission, adolescents since birth, eyes set on gettin bigger
just anotha wild ass n****
 what?
couldn't be no sex without that gold lexus
seein visions of people smokin and n****z catchin vapors
got his man from around the corner they got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin
still no one's knowin, so they kept goin
catchin dealers comin out they cars (plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate
to death and wish they could die) so peep the lesson
but wait a minute back to precious
she's snortin dope in the back seat of trigg's lexus
teardrops and closed caskets
 will i.. forever be alone
 teardrops and closed caskets
 teardrops and closed caskets
 will i.. forever be alone
 teardrops and closed caskets
hopin god's blessings stick with ya
picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin bigger
familiar face, but a man now, it's lil' trigga
now lil' mo was a soldier to the fullest
down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
now precious is pregnant, lil' trigga is happy
he wants to marry her now but precious was lonely while lil' trigga was makin dough
she's slippin in secret places and gettin with lil' mo
the neighborhood's buzzin, now people are talkin
lil' trigga's gettin pictures of the both of 'em walkin
how his baby's mama could disapear with another man
now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
there ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin
just the smoke from the cap peelin a man with no feelings
teardrops and closed caskets
 will i.. forever be alone
 teardrops and closed caskets
bury you dead and look ahead
a man with no feelings
 teardrops and closed caskets
 will i.. forever be alone
 teardrops and closed caskets
that's all we got left, that's all
now with the problems of poverty
and the tricks to these tales
how many people'll die
how many'll live to tell
although best friends before
lil' trigga and mo
behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
the results is the same with different names and it turns out
y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
lil' trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
think it's lil' mo all the while let's look at precious
too dumb to see what's goin down used to be comrades what could be so bad from misdemeanors to felonies, small time to sellin ki's
i can't believe the shit they tellin me
they open fire, three bodies drop, so call the cops
teardrops and closed caskets
 will i.. forever be alone
 aiy qbiii in this motherf***er
teardrops and closed caskets
we dedicate this to all the fallen comrades
all the homies that didn't make it to see this day
 will i.. forever be alone
 yaknahmean? i know it's hard out there, heheh
with teardrops and closed caskets
it's like that's all we got to look forward to these days
murders, brothers dyin, funerals
 will i.. forever be alone

i done ran out of tears
know we gon' have to do somethin y'all
we gon' have to do somethin
 will i.. forever be alone
 cause i know all these mothers is tired of seein the same thing
teardrops and closed caskets
i send this out to m'thulu geronimo
and to, all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers

 all the homies that fell, all the homies
may god bless your families
may you always live in the motherf***in heart

 rarely 'cause i'm keepin' myself busy
 nah, i leave the cuttin' up to dizzy"
" 
these are hard times we livin' in, churches burnin',
planes fallin' from the
sky, murder, the good die young, the good
definatly die young. this is
just a little something to help you get through the
day, if it could.
verse 1: 
it was, more than a tragedy, emotions be grabbin' me,
plane fell from the sky, we tryin' to figure what
happened,
burnin' churches, fearin' god, who could be so cruel?
we all ignorant to aids, 'till it happens to you,
just be a man, make plans, listen to your voice,
a woman's tryin' to make decisions, we should leave
'em a choice.
'cause who are we to say who lives or dies, breathes
or stops?
all these judgements on other lives, needs to stop,
what are we livin' for? givin' more back than takin',
on my knees still waitin' for my own salvation,
now i feel abandoned, 'cause pat buchanan say i'm
greedy,
you can take my taxes, send me to war, but can't feed
me?
it's so easy to regret things, after they done,
babies catchin' murder cases, scared to laugh in the
sun,
the tragedy is that we all need, love in doses,
it's times like these, we feel closest, the good die
young.
x2
does anybody have an answer why,
it seems the good die young?
can anybody tell me why?
can anybody tell me why?
 the good die young, it's times like these we feel
closest. the good die young,
rest in peace, god bless the dead. can we carry on?
the good die young, the
good die young. now we hear from the future, the next
generation.
verse 2: 
how in the world will it get worse? when i been
trapped since birth,
but i had to sleep in the hearse, 'cause it was my bed
first,
my grands probably burnin',turnin, in the graves,
some folks ain't even get to see a high age,
but they did, so i ain't afraid,
and this money got me feelin' like a star,
and this murder got me feelin' like my death ain't
far,
in the land of stardom and cars,
don't get better, don't get weaker, or no, harder,
i was raised in the rush without my moms, and my,
father,
so tell me somethin', if i grab my gat and get to
dumpin,
will god get to lookin' at me, funny? ha
rest in peace to my mother, aquillah beale
rest in peace to my father, salek beale
rest in peace to my grandparents,
and thug in peace to my brother seike,
you know i love you.
verse 3: 
which is worse, fist storm and then al, pac and then
yak,
reverend brown, could've swore i saw yo' face in the
clouds,
family grievin' on yo' last breath,
close to the heart, whether you know it or not,
i swear the love won't stop,
jewel, thats my boo, mom, duke, and lou,
from jump, you kept it true, helped to feed the crew,
the good die young, livin' fast jumpin' the gun,
momma blamin' the community fo' killin' her son,
my cousin' darin wasn't scared of goin',
but never knowin' he would die slower,
i guess i'll see you when i see you soulja.
x1
verse 4: 
i know my life ain't promised, that's why the wise
move in silence,
analyze these scandolous times, it's hard dawg but we
manage,
schools turn to war zones, even homes unsafe,
leavin' children to play caged, and raged to hate,
how come? someone explain, why the good die young,
why the bad die slow, and outlive everyone?
it's time somethin' is done, for our young kids,
they growin' hopeless and that ain't the way to live,
tell me why.
verse 5: 
days goin' pass, and as they pass time moves with it,
no time for wastin', put your hustle down my young
dealers,
'cause the end is nearin', but at least thats what
they, tellin' me,
hell all i know brutha's ain't ridin' fo' 3 felonies,
it's time to plan, plot, stratagize, capatalize,
mobelize,
we in the war y'all, it's for all of y'all,
my family, to the ones who stand me,
little bit mo' love is reccomended,
and it's plain to see, the seeds from you and me,
goin' be the ones to lead us, towards unity,
that's if we treat 'em right, man, teach 'em right,
raise yo' kids better than you was, and see what it
does,
but if you don't, man we'll surely be done,
and we'll all see exactly why the good's dyin' young.
 
you ain't lyin' man, the good die young.the good die
young, i send this out to
all my homeboyz who passed away, and all yo' homeboyz
who passed away. i send
this out to all the folden, fallen, souljas that's in
the cemetaries buried,
never got to see they dreams. for everything i touch,
you touch. for every step
i take, you take. for every breath i breath, you
breath. every dollar i make,
you make. i told you we'd make it to the
sunshine one day, you just
got there a little quicker. but like my homeboyz, the
thugs say, i'll
catch you at the crossroads. the good die young.
oklahoma, little young
xzanapher, tasha harlans, all the fallen kids, the
dead babies, the closed
caskets.
 
this song is dedicated, to all them kids who died
innocent and died young, at

it came from concrete
did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
it, learned to breathe fresh air

well, we are the rose   this is the concrete   and these are
my damaged petals. don't ask me why, thank god n****, ask me how!

amongst tha babies, who raised up from tha slavery

by a brotha who was hopeless
grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
how many pistols smoking coming from a broken family

sick of tha sirens, body bags, and tha gun firing

sometimes i think my block is dying
and that it's awful
to wake up to another day, shit ain't change that all fool
i wake up sweatin, dreamin, coughin
seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
while i'm layin in the coffin
the shit comes around so often
so tell me something
before i take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
n**** i been so through pain go through the struggle
doin the same thing you did at my age and that's hustlin
on the edge of straight bustin'

crazed raised off hennesey, tell me will my enemies

in order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
caught a n**** so they send me to these overpacked jails
in the cell, countin days in this livin black hell, do you feel me?
keys to ignition, use at your discretion
roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
n****z hate me in the section from years of chin checkin
turn to smith and wesson war weapons

bless myself when knowin rules to these streets, somethin i learned
in school, on some million man march sh*t for the piece/peace

"love within a storm 
first it was nothin', not even, a fake ?
loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along
there was a gleam of a star in your eyes
thought i'd never feel this way again
and you were supposed to reach my heart
and find love within, looove, looove
oooh...oooh
love within a storm this sweet, wonderful ghetto love
this sweet, wonderful love that you give me
wonderful
i could not ignore the magnetism, when i felt you near
any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly dissapeared
it was re birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend
'cause i knew for the moment i held you, that i would fall in love again
fall in love again, in a storm
love within a storm 
just when i thought i'd seen it all
our paths crossed, amen
and i knew, from the first glance
that you, would be hard to forget
your eyes, attracted me first
but you reeked of sultry confidence
i couldn't wait, to touch lips
and kiss, with my heart's intention
when we didn't, was what i expected
and for that moment, we erased the tension
of the awkwardness, of first date jitters
and the initial blind date, first impressions
we kissed again; and i felt the passion
and this, my love, was cupid's blessin'
we made love, within a storm
in the midst of passion and chaos
somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost
in the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder
those who prevail this drama
will learn to bring their love farther
but now, the storm has past
and the seas of our friendship are gone
but as long as i live, i will remember
the love within a storm
sweet, passionate, love lusting love
ya know that i miss you, and love you
ya know that tupac broke my heart
we need to hear ya, hear ya voice
they say, this ghetto fabulous
on 125th street forkin' around
this village, and the village uptown
south central, compton, philly
sha town, southside

"shit, tired of gettin' shot at
tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
n****s need a spot where we can kick it
a spot where we belong, that's just for us
n****s ain't gotta get all dressed up and be hollywood
y'knahmean?
where do n****s go when we die?
ain't no heaven for a thug, n****
that's why we go to thug mansion
that's the only place where thugs get in free
and you gotta be a g,
at thug mansion
a place to spend my quiet nights,
time to unwind, so much pressure in this life of mine
i cry at times
i once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
but when i held that 9,
all i could see was my momma's eyes
no one knows my struggle,
they only see the trouble
not knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
picture me inside the misery of poverty
no man alive has ever witnessed
struggles i survived
prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
me and my dawgs ain't have a
choice but to roll on
we found a family spot to kick it
where we can drink liquor
and no one bickers over trick shit
a spot where we can smoke in peace,
and even though we g's
we still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
and in my mind's eye i see this place,
the players go in fast
i got a spot for us all,
so we can ball, at thugz mansion
every corner, every city
there's a place where life's a little easy
little hennessey, laid back and cool
every hour 'cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright
nothin' but peace, love and street passion
every ghetto needs a thug mansion
will i survive all the fights and the darkness?
trouble sparks,
they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
i shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
for multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
they'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
or am i just a victim of things i did to maintain?
i need a place to rest my head
with the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
i'll be right behind ya, show me and i'll go
how can i be peaceful? i'm coming from the bottom
watch my daddy scream, ""peace,"" while the other man shot him
i need a house that's full of love when i need to escape
the deadly places slingin' drugs, in thugz mansion
every corner, every city
there's a place where life's a little easy
little hennessey, laid back and cool
every hour 'cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright
nothin' but peace, love and street passion
every ghetto needs a thug mansion
dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
tell the homies i'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
seen a show with marvin g**e last night,
it had me shook
drippin peppermint schnapps, with jackie wilson,
and sam cooke
then some lady named
billie holiday
sang sittin there kickin it with malcolm, 'til the day came
little latasha sho' grown
tell the lady in the liquorstore
that she's forgiven, so come home
maybe in time you'll understand
only god can save us
when miles davis cuttin lose with the band
just think of all the people that you
knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
picture a place that they exist, together

to live and die in la
california   don't care what you say about los angeles
still the only place for me it never rains
to live and die in la
where everyday we try a fatten' our pockets
us n****z hustle for the cash so it's hard to knock it
everybody got their own thang currency chasin'
world wide through the hard times worrying faces
shed tears as we bury n****z close to heart
what was a friend now a ghost in the dark
cold hearted bout it, n**** got smoked by a fiend
tryin to floss on em'
blind to a broken man's dream
a hard lesson  court cases  keep em guessin'
plea bargain ain't an option now  so i'm stressin'
cost me more to be free than a life in the penn
making money off of cuss words  writin' again
learn how to think ahead  so i fight with my pen
late night down sunset like in a sin
what's the worst they could do to a n****
get me lost in hell  to live and die in la
on bail  my angels sing...
chorus:
to live and die in la, it's the place to be
you've got to be there to know it
where everybody wanna see
to live and die in la, it's the place to be
you've got to be there to know it
everybody wanna see
it's the cities of angels and constant danger
south central la  can't get no stranger
full of drama like a soap opera
on the curb watching the ghetto bird helicopters
i observe  so many n****z
gettin 3 strikes  tossed in jail
swear the penn's right across from hell
i can't cry  cause it's home now
i'm just a n**** on his own now
livin life thug style  so i can't smile
writin to my peoples
when they ask for pictures

"you know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
cause they never talk peace in tha black community
all we know is violence, do tha job in silence
walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
n****s commin' out worse offthan when they went in
over tha years i done alot of growin' up
getten drunk thrown' up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route, way out
to money and fame, i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i gettem
i'll hittem with tha bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'g'
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
they got me trapped....
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
trapped
they got me trapped
can barely walk tha city streets
without a cop harrassing me, searching me
then asking my identity
hands up, throw me up against tha wall
didn't do a thing at all
i'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didn't know this was tha wrong street
bang bang, down another casualty
but it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
who do you blame?
it's a shame because tha mans slain
he got caught in tha chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
sweated me, hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day i'm gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me ?
i couldn't find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie don't play that
it's time i lett'em suffer tha payback
i'm tryin to avoid physical contact
i can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
they got me trapped
chorus
you know they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a 'g' and somewhere safe to stay
can't use tha phone
cause i'm sure someone is tappin in
did it before
ain't scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now he's tha devils friend
too late to be tellin' him
he shot first and i'll be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasn't thinkin' all i heard was tha ridicule
girlies was laughin', tup sayin ""damn homies is dissin you""
i fired my weapon
started steppin' in tha hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin' a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin' for my getaway
coppers said freeze, or you'll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldn't see tha light
thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
what do i do ?
live my life in a prison cell
i'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped
chorus
they got me trapped
trapped
you know they got me trapped
trapped"

"unconditional love talking bout the stuff that don't wear off
it don't fade
it'll last for all these crazy days
these crazy nights
whether you wrong or you right
i'm a still love you
still feel you
still there for you
no matter what you will always be in my heart
with unconditional love
come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
all my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
how many caskets can we witness
before we see it's hard to live
this life without god, so we must ask forgiveness
ask mama why i got this urge to die
witness the tears falling free from my eyes
before she could reply
though we were born without a silver spoon
my broken down tv, show cartoons in my living room one day i hope to make it
a player in this game
mama don't cry, long as we try
maybe things change
perhaps it's just a fantasy
a life where we don't need no welfare
shit with our whole family
maybe it's me that caused it
the fighting and the hurting
in my room crying cause i didn't want to be a burden
watch mama open up her arms to hugging
and i ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditionl love
in this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
though things change, the future's still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
just got the message you've been calling all week
been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
but you know, with you and me it's on g
we could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me
where would i be without my dogs
no wonder why when times get hard
cause it ain't easy being who we are
driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
so i proceed to make gs, eternally in my mission
is to be more than just a rap musician
the elevation of today's generation
if could make 'em listen
prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat
when we make somethin out of nothing
no pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
if they could cut out all the busting
the liquor and the weed the cussing
sending love out to my block
the struggle never stops 
i'll probably never understand ya ways
with everyday i swear i hear ya
trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time
just had a baby with the same man
something inside, please let me die these are strange times
how come i never made it
maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
i knew one day i gotta be a star
my hopes and all my wishes
so many vivid pictures, and all the currency
i'll never even get to see
this fast life soon shatter us
cause after all the lights and screams
nothing but my dreams matter
hoping for better days
maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry
cause everythang gonna be alright
just lay your head on my shoulder
don't worry bout a thang baby
girl i'm a soldier never treated me bad, no matter who i was
you still came with that, unconditional love"
"under pressure

"perhaps i was addicted to the dark side
somewhere inside my childhood i missed my heart die
and even though we both came from the same places
the money and the fame made us all change places
how could it be through the misery that came to pass
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for
currency
but you could run to me when you need me, i'll never
leave
i just needed someone to believe in, as you can see
it's a small thang through and true
what could i do? real homies help ya get through,
and coming new, he'd do tha same thang if he could
cuz in the hood true homies make you feel good
and half the time we be acting up call tha cops
bringing the cease to tha peace that was on my block
it never stop, when my mama ask me will i change
i tell her yeah, but it's clear i'll always be tha
same
until the end of time
so take, these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
so i can fly away, until the end of time
until the end of time
until the end of time
please lord forgive me for my life of sin
my hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
so you know i don't hang around tha house much
this all night money making got me outta touch, shit
ain't flashed a smile in a long while
an unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
my attitude got me walking solo
ride out alone in my low low
watching the whole world move in slow mo
for quiet times disappear listen to the ocean
smoking ports think my thoughts
then it's back to coasting
who can i trust in this cold world
my phony homey had a baby by my own girl
but i ain't trippin i'm a player i ain't sweating him
i sex his sister, had her mo' good like a mexican
his next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen
besides rapping the only thing i did good was
scrapping
until the end of time
now who's to say if i was right or wrong?
to live my life as an outlaw all along
remain strong in this planet full of playa haters
they conversate but death row full of demonstrators
and in tha end drinking henessy made all my enemies
envy me
so cold when i flow eliminating easily
fall to their knees, they plead for their right to
breath
while beggin me to keep the peace well i can see close into achieve
in times of danger don't freeze time to be a g
follow my lead i supply everything you need
an ounce of game and the trainin to make a g
remember me, as an outcast outlaw

they called for back up, and they'll be on their way
jumped in tha car, and tried ta get away quick
tha car wouldn't start, we in deep shit
so we jumped out, we drove a little ways thinking that we got far
but i looked up and all i saw was blue lights

i cannot bear captivity
where my country, i am told, ""hold no significance""
i withered and died in ignorance
but my inner eye can see, a race,
who reigned as kings in another place
the green trees were rich and full
and every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as people
war was gone because all was at peace
but now like a nightmare, i woke to see
that i live like a prisoner of poverty..

of an invisible bond of friendship, that was formed, in secrecy
coming from me this may seem hard but, but to god i swear   it's truth
we are friends for eternity and for ever i will always love.. you..
what of a love unspoken?
is it weaker without a name?
does love exist without a title
because i do not share it's name?
all my life i've dreamed of
of meeting one with immense beauty and
and once i found her i would charm her and
and she'd be mine forever i found her and, indeed she is all that i, wished for and more but she
is not charmed nor intrigued then i think to myself what.. can i offer her
the tears warm my eyes and blur my, vision i
stick to my stance of bravado and give her
the same uninterested look that she, gave, me
 she was so beautiful
but what.. can i offer her?
you say that you'll love me forever but
but what about today?
as the dusks become the dawns and the years pass on will you
love me  the same way ?
if so let us rejoice and bathe in this constant pleasure
if not spare my heart today and i shall recover before, forever
and if my doubts and questions upset you
 forgive my fragile heart
i just wanted to know if you'd love me forever before today,
would start

what of a love unspoken?"

before it all troubled, beware of death, just continue strugglin'...
cause nothin's impossible, if there's a will there's a way
so get yo mind on official business, you can be paid...
and it's been this way from the cradle to the grave,
to get paid my n****s do this every f***in' day, we parley...
through politics and conversation,
this information to my thug n****s in the congregation...
watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation,
separation and self destruction, must needed if unification...
it's the world, ain't harely scared, and 'bout prepared, be sure to be buried,
and be no longer there...

"where there is a will there is a way
search and discover a better day
where a positive heart is all you need
to rise from beyond and succeed
and young minds grow and respect each other based on their deeds
and not their color
look and them and say as i say
where there is a will there is a way
i don't know why the caged bird sings
but as long as thug life in my veins i be doin' my thing
these blocks raised me to hustle for change
i learned the hard way without pain there is no gain
my life experience is trapped on page
my thoughts in my brain release when i be rappin' on stage
i'm like a prophet of rage with a glock and a guage
i bang for my gang, won't hesitate to cock it and blaze
some years in this game can teach ya some things
i've seen many try and fail but the strong remain
my uncle boo been locked away since i signed my name
and i opened to family and friends for fortune and fame
i'm dedicatin' every song that i sing
in appreciation of loved ones from here to the grave
and i know this shit ain't easy but ya help me to maintain
struggle continues, where there is a will there is a way
he said
where there is a will there is a way
to search and discover, find a better day
where a positive heart is all you need
to rise beyond and succeed
i let my heart in the pen speak
i just guide the words and let 'em touch who they reach
they even fall upon the ears of the deaf
but you can read it in braile or come to me in the flush
i'm authentic, i fire back if i'm fired on
but i'm human i bleed if my skin gets torn
and i was born within a gemini astrology
i'm in the hood and boys see the two sides of me
that's why he said where there's a will there's a way
ya have to think about tomorrow if ya livin' today
no one's worthless the girl with no father
lookin' for love from any man that will bother
she takes the money and she whispers his name
like the paper and the tears gon' wash away all that pain
yeah, it's sad but that's how it goes down
so keep ya head up and smile for me now
just get ya click together and ya chips together
when y'all sit together and ya shit together, never
let no man show ya no hand and no plan
that didn't show his home card, no fam
where there's a will there's a way
and the jungle is a maze
when they rumble it's the strays that be duckin' like hey
i ain't tryin' to go to bed in the same night
ricochet shots cover my head in the same sights
all i see so, all be is doin' this, pursuin'
the same dream to make cream
and the same fiends i pass by i ask why
get the answer smoke cancer and slide
i look up in the sky give praise for everyday
that i'm sure to get paid like the sun give rays
listen, it's hard enough to get a job but
it's harder to help us, hype, hustle, and tight the squad"
"intro:
when thugz cry
now i lay me down to sleep
i pray to lord my guns to keep
if i die before i wake
i pray to lord my soul to take
got us dying
when thugz cry
times is hard
verse one:
born thuggin' and lovin'
the way i came up, big money clutchin'
bustin' while evadin' cocaine bust
my po's rushin'
to my cushin' into insanity
they shot at my cousin now we bustin' at they whole family
these cowards wanna see me burried, i ain't worried
i got a line on the d.a. cause i'm f***in' the secretary
i black out, start cussin, bust 'em, and touch 'em all
they panicin' b****es duckin', i rush 'em, and f*** 'em all
probably be an old man before i understand
why i had to live my life with pistols close in hand
kidnapped my homie sister cut her face up bad
they even raped her so we blazed they pad
automatic shots rang out, on every block
they puttin hits on politicians even cops
i ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams
and in my dreams i hear muthaf***as screamin'
what is the meanin'?
when thugz cry
chorus:
oh why
should you send your child off to die
in the streets of chalk
when they die
let the rocks cry out
when thugz cry
dear god
oh why
does it have to be this way ahh
children of today won't stay wise
let the children hear
when thugz cry
dear god
oh why
verse two:
maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'
where is the love, never quit my ambitionz to thug
ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
n****z i used to love they closed the penitentiary
still homie keep it real, how does it feel?
to loose your life over somethin' that you did as a kid
you all alone no communication, block on the phone
don't get along with your pops and plus your moms is gone
where did we go wrong? i put my soul in this song
to help us grow in time but now our minds is gone
we went from brothas and sistas to n****z and b****es
we went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches
but somethin' change in this dirty game
everythin' strange, lost all my homies over cocaine, man
see they ask me if i shed a tear, i ain't lie
see, you gotta get high or die
cause even thugz cry
chorus:
oh why
should you send your child off to die
in the streets of chalk
when they die
let the rocks cry out
when thugz cry
dear god
oh why
does it have to be this way ahh
children of today won't stay wise
let the children hear
when thugz cry
dear god
oh why
verse three:
and all i see are these paraniod b****es, illegal inventions
bustin' muthaf***as with upper cuts, i leave 'em with dentures
cause in my criminal mind nobody violates the don
i write your name on a piece of paper, and now your family's gone
well perpetrate like you could handle my team
so merciless in mind try to take command of your dreams
leavin muthaf***as drowin in they own blood
clown and taking pictures
later, laugh about the punk b****es
that turn snitches
regulate my area the terror i represent
make your people disappear, your wonderin' where they went
am i cold, or is it just i sold my soul?
addicted to the streets
never find true peace i'm told
come take my body, god
don't let me suffer any longer
smoke a pound of marijuana so i know it ain't long
where is the end to all my misery?
is there a close?
i suppose that's why i murder my foes
when thugz cry
chorus:
oh why
should you send your child off to die
in the streets of chalk
when they die
let the rocks cry out
when thugz cry
dear god
oh why
does it have to be this way ahh
children of today won't stay wise
let the children hear
when thugz cry
dear god"
"hey, ooh ah ooh oh oh
when your hero falls from grace
all your fairy tales are uncovered
myths exposed and pain magnified
the greatest pain discovered
you told me to be strong but i'm confused to see you so weak
you said to never to give up and it hurts to see you welcoming me
when your hero falls so do the stars
when your hero falls so do the stars
and so does the perception of tomorrow
without my hero there is only me alone
to deal with my sorrow, to deal with my sorrow
your insistance to work and your soul is not happy at all
what do you expect it to do when your hero falls
so do the stars
see i know you're wondering how do i carry on
you want to give up you feel there's nobody to love
but if you look around there's so many people have been what you been
through
you gotta let go you gotta be strong oh
sing it again one more time
when your hero falls when your hero falls when your hero falls when your hero falls when your hero falls when your hero falls when your only hero falls 
when your hero falls when your hero falls when your hero falls when your hero falls when your hero falls when your hero falls when your only hero falls"
"when your heart turns cold
it causes your soul to freeze
spreads through your spirit
like a ruthless, villain disease
the walls that were once down
now stand firm and tall
safe from hate, love, pain, joy
till you feel nothing at all
when your heart turns cold
a baby's cry means nothing
a dead corpse is trivial
mothers neglecting children is daily
lonliness becomes your routine friend
death seems like tranquility
sleeping is never pleasant if you even sleep at all
we forgot our deals and turn off the reason
till the product is sold
you don't understand how i behave
wait till your heart turns cold
know my cold heart turns warm at the front door
love my family, love my outlawz
but when i step outside i feel my blood freezing
question if it's a blessing that 'm still breathing
sometimes i wonder if i'm better off dead
they say god don't make mistakes but what if he did
but what if he didn't
so i'm supposed to be living this life that i'm living
and feeling how i'm feeling
black rain shower, the pain builds character
my heart turned cold, yeah i learned to be a scavenger
listen, no love received and no love given
don't blame us blame the hate that you gave the children
no remorse for life and y'all forced to fight
in the event of my demise i hope god's the guiding light
in hind's sight, i'm lost, misguided by lies and truths
confused bout what to do, refer to smoking, drinking brew
we be the hearts of the heartless, riding few from the bunch
bosses have falled, bosses have caught you don't be the next one
sleeping never pleasant even if you sleeping at all
the reason that i'm breathing is i'm an example for y'all
when your heart turns cold
it causes your soul to freeze
spreads through your spirit like a deadly disease
when your heart turns cold
you feel nothing at all
a baby's cry means nothing at al
when your heart turns cold
a dead corpse is trivial
and death seems like tranquility
when your heart turns cold
i thank god above
through the pain, hate, joy, and love
when your heart turns cold
your soul is numb, your days are numbered your kids cold, get old and younger your lonliness becomes your only homie
so your sorrow all alone is just for your eyes only the world against you and the odds are stacked your pockets short and your girls a wreck lose a piece of you survive all that
plus you young and you black, it's hard enough being that your mom gone ain't nobody never cared you call your mom but nobody never there now it's on, you need a way up out of here
you click on some be next shit
when your heart turn cold that's when the heat go off
and the means die slow, that's how the streets show off
cemetaries filled with vicitms those with cold hearts
deep in the dark when the pistols spark
my life one big movie of strife
scene after scene filled with nothing but sad dreams
no wonder my heart pumps ice water
gotta live according to the lessons that life taught you
lonley is the road of a tortured soul
who only knows the roles of a heart turned cold
caught in the middle when the pistols blow
that's how it go when your heart turns cold"

*singers singing variations of 'where do we go from here'*

"where there is a will
there is a way
2 search and discover
a better day
where a positive heart
is all u need
2 rise beyond
and succeed
where young minds grow
and respect each other
based on their deeds
and not their color
when times r dim
say as i say
""where there is a will
there is a way!"".."
"i ain't saying i'm innocent of all this
i'm just saying
this song is for y'all
for all the times i mess up
when we mess up
dear sister
got me twisted up in prison
i miss yah
crying
looking at my nieces and newphews picture
they say don't let this cruel world get yah
kinda suspicious,
swearing one day you might leave me
for someone thats richer
twist the cap off the bottle
i take a sip and see tommorrow
gotta make if i have to beg and borrow
reading love letters
late night, locked down, and quiet
if brothers don't recieve their mail
best believe we riot
eating jack mat
staring at walls of silence
inside this cage
where they captured all my rage and violence
in time i learned a few lessons
never fall for riches
aplogizies to my true sisters
far from b****es
help me raise my black nation
reperations are due
its true
caught up in this world
i took advantage of you
so tell the babies how i love them
precious boys and girls
born black in this white mans world
and all i heard was
chorus
who knows what tommorrow brings
in this world where everyone lies
where to go
no matter how far i find
to let you know
that you're not alone
being born with less
i must confess
only adds on to the stress
two gunshots to my homies head
died in his rest
shot him to death
and left him bleeding for his family to see
i pass his casket
gently asking
is there heaven for g's?
my homeboys doing life
begging mama be stressing
shedding tears
when her son finally ask that questions
where my daddy at?
mama, why we live so poor?
why you crying?
heard you late night
throught my bedroom door
now do you love me mama?
why do they keep calling me n****?
get my wieght up, with my hate
and pay 'em back when i'm bigger
still thugging in this jail cell
missing my block
hearing brothers screaming all night
wishing they'd stop
proud to be black
but why do we act like
we don't love oursleves
don't look around
busta check yourselves
know what if means to be black
whether a man or girl
we're still struggling in this
white man's world
chorus
who knows what tommorrow brings
in this world where everyone lies
where to go
no matter how far i find
to let you know
that you're not alone
so tell me why you changed?
choosing new direction
in a blink of an eye
my time away just made perfection
you think i'd die
not gonna cry
why should i care
like we holding on to love
thats no longer there
can you please help me
god bless me please
keep my seeds healthy
banging on my enemies bleed
while my g's healthy
hoping they bury me
with ammunition, weed, and shells
just in case they trip in heaven
ain't no g's hell
sister sorry for the pain
that i caused your heart
i know i'll change
if yah help me
but don't fall apart
rest in peace
to latasha, little yummy, and kato
to much for this cold world to take
ended up being fatal
every women in america
especially black
bear with me, can't you see
we're under attack
i never meant to cause drama
to my sister and mama
will we make it
to better times
in this white man's world
chorus"
"let us pray
heavenly father, hear a n**** down here
before i go to sleep
tell me, who do you believe in?
who do you believe in?
i see mothers in black cryin, brothers in packs dyin
plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why
watchin our own downfall, witness the end
it's like we don't believe in god cause we livin in sin
i asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
it's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
my tear drops gettin bigger but can't figure what i'm cryin for
is it the miniature caskets, little babies
victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy
maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
perhaps the underlyin fact they hide explain genocide
it's when we ride on our own kind
what is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror
we can't escape fate, the end is gettin nearer
who do you believe in?
i put my faith in god, blessed and still breathin
and even though it's hard, that's who i believe in
before i'm leavin, i'm askin the grievin   who do you believe in?
can't close my eyes cause all i see is terror
i hate the man in the mirror
cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
times of armageddeon, murder in mass amounts
in this society where only gettin the cash counts
i started out as a beginner
entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
i make my money and vacate, evade prison
went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
and all the hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain i feel inside
you know, it's like i'm livin just to die
i fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin if i'm worthy
livin life thinkin no man can hurt me
so i'm askin    before i lay me down to sleep
before you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery
i rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
in my search for fame will i change? i'm askin
faith in allah, believe in me and this plastic
cause so far i done witnessed to many dead n****z in caskets
with they chest plates stretched like elastic
and what's worse i'm on front line, holdin down camp, still mashin
heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
just came home october of '95 back in yardsville stuck
with a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize
if you don't stay wise, then in this game you f***ed
talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
one of the grimmies is snitchin, diamond a stool pigeon i talked to him
he said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure
cause he just came home off of bail
 now tell me
who do you believe in?
is it buddah, jehovah, or jah? or allah?
is it jesus? is it god? or is just yourself?
definately not to be imposed, being a demon
because this is the joy of believing!
men, to believe in yourselves
but for sure, the higher power
resides only to ride in the heart of the true
from the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi
in the poetry, or in it's realm
that's what pulls all words together
just to understand, that every man, is his own man
and only man can satisfy the man
only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man
the for realness of the man
you can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
and you gotta call yourself because you are that man
who do you believe in?
i put my faith in god, blessed and still breathin
who do you believe in? put my faith in god, and
blessed and still breathin
even though it's hard that's who i believe in before i'm leavin i'm askin the grievin
who do you believe in? who do you oh blessed, oh blessed
oh who do you
do you believe in
hohhhhh ohhhhh
who do you believe in?
i put my faith in god, blessed and still breathin
and even though it's hard, that's who i believe in
before i'm leavin i'm askin the grievin   who do you believe in?
i'm askin i'm askin you 
who do you believe in?
i'm blessed and still breathin
that's who i believe in
before i'm leavin, i'm askin the grievin
who do you believe in?
who do you believe in? "

"why must you be unfaithful?
for women.....
men, you shouldn't listen to your selfish heart
it doesn't really have a brain
besides keepin you alive, its existence is in vain
and how could i be so mean, and say your heart has no place?
because mortal men fall in love again
as fast as they change their fate
i may be cruel, but think awhile about the hearts that you have broken, and match that with the empty vows and broken promises that you have spoken.
now i'm not saying females are perfect
cuz we all know its not true
but why must you be unfaithful
if her heart is true to you??"

"killing us one by one
in one way or another
american will find a way to eliminate the problem
one by one
the problem is
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
and one by one
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
at an extremly alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact
that we are not fighting back
brothers, sistas, n****s
when i say n****s it is not the n**** we are grown to fear
it is not the n**** we say as if it has no meaning
but to me
it means never ignorant getting goals acomplishes, n****
n****s what are we going to do
walk blind into a line or fight
fight and die if we must like n****s
this is for the masses the lower classes
the ones you left out, jobs were givin', better livin'
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior, but we're the superior
break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
pledge a legiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that who refuses to respect us
emmancipation, proclamation, please!
n**** just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
running through our community, killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me its all about hyprocracy
the constitution, yo, it don't apply to me
lady liberty still the b**** lied to me
steady strong nobody's gonna like what i pumpin'
but its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
so get up, its time to start nation building
i'm fed up, we gotta start teaching childern
that they can be all that they wanna to be
there's much more to life than just poverty
this is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
amerika, amerika, amerikkka
i charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people
i charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor do you have any more evidience
words of wisdom
they shine upon the strength of an nation
conquer the enemy on with education
protect thy self, reach with what you wanna do
know thy self, teach what we been through
on with the knowledge of the place, then
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text
why is that?
cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week?
he told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
i don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated, they act as if asking questions is a crime
but forget it, one day i'm gonna prove them wrong
now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
the american dream, though it seems it attainable
they're pulling your sleave, don't believe
cause it will strangle yah
pulling the life of your brain, i can't explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgeting your brother that's living her apology
thought they had us beat when they took our kids
but the battle ain't over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
but the battle ain't over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
nightmare thats what i am
america's nightmare
i am what you made me
the hate and evil that you gave me
i shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
for four hundred plus years
you should be scared
you should be running
you should be trying to silence me
ha ha
but you can not escape fate
well it is my turn to come
just as you rose you shall fall
by my hands
amerika, you reap what you sow
2pacalypse america's nightmare
ice cube and da lench mob america's nightmare
above the law america's nightmare
paris america's nightmare
public enemy america's nightmare
krs one america's nightmare
mutulu shakur america's nightmare
geronimo pratt america's nightmare
assada shakur america's nightmare"

that's in tha rush to be gangstas...
as a young n****
i'm almost runnin' in the wind
give anything
to be that innocent again
when i was ten
i didn't bang
but i was hangin with tha homies
till them n****s started slangin'
now they don't know me
i got my hustle on
learned to ignore
what coulda fade me lately i been tryin to make a million
can you blame me with that jelousy they wanna diss me
don't sweat me
if tha cowards really want me
come get me
and even i
someday will die
but i'm cautious up in my ride
put down the top
now we flossin
hit the freeway
let the wind blow
drop the window
workin with a 20 sack a indo
feelin' good
stop through the hood
grab tha young thugs
and i can't help but reminice back when we slung drugs
it was bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
couldn't see, unless we learned to slang dope to fiends

your the kind of g like everyone knows
he's always g'ed up, from head to toe
always got it flown like al capone
he's the kind of g out there, i know
back in jr. high
when we was barely getting by
when daddy died
that's when my momma started gettin high
my neighborhood was full of drive bys
couldn't survive
all my homies livin short lives
i couldn't cry
told my momma if i did die
just put a blunt in my casket
let me get my dead homies high
then follow me throughout my history
it's just me against the world
stuck in misory
as a young n****
my only thing is to get paid
life full of riches
avoid snitches cause they shadey
back in the day
we always had the time to play
but after they taught them gangbangers how to spray
not just la
but in the bay and chicago and even st. louis
every stadium that i go
when will they change?
stuck in the game like a dumb n****
remember how it was...
to be a young n****

murdered for hangin at tha wrong place at the wrong time
no longer livin
cause he trew up tha wrong sign
and everyday
i watch tha murder rate increase
and even worse
