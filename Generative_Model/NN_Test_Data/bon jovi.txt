"this ain't a song for the broken hearted
no silent prayer for the faith departed
i ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
you're gonna hear my voice when i shout it out loud
it's my life
it's now or never
i ain't gonna live forever
i just want to live while i'm alive
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
i did it my way
i just wanna live while i'm alive
it's my life
this is for the ones who stood their ground
for tommy and gina who never backed down
tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
luck ain't even lucky
got to make your own breaks
it's my life
it's now or never
i ain't gonna live forever
i just want to live while i'm alive
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
i did it my way
i just wanna live while i'm alive
'cause it's my life
better stand tall when they're calling you out
don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
it's my life
it's now or never
'cause i ain't gonna live forever
i just want to live while i'm alive
my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said
i did it my way
i just wanna live while i'm alive
it's now or never
i ain't gonna live forever
i just want to live while i'm alive

"once upon a time
not so long ago
tommy used to work on the docks
union's been on strike
he's down on his luck
it's tough, so tough
gina works the diner all day
working for her man, she brings home her pay
for love, for love
she says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
we've got each other and that's a lot for love
we'll give it a shot
we're half way there
livin' on a prayer
take my hand, we'll make it, i swear
livin' on a prayer
tommy got his six string in hock
now he's holding in
when he used to make it talk, so tough
it's tough
gina dreams of running away
when she cries in the night tommy whispers
baby it's okay, someday
we've got to hold on to what we've got
it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
we've got each other and that's a lot for love
we'll give it a shot
we're half way there
livin' on a prayer
take my hand, we'll make it, i swear
livin' on a prayer
livin' on a prayer
we've got to hold on ready or not
you live for the fight when that's all that you've got
we're half way there
livin' on a prayer
take my hand, we'll make it, i swear
livin' on a prayer
we're half way there
livin' on a prayer
take my hand, we'll make it, i swear
livin' on a prayer"
"this romeo is bleeding
but you can't see his blood
it's nothing but some feelings
that this old dog kicked up
it's been raining since you left me
now i'm drowning in the flood
you see i've always been a fighter
but without you i give up
now i can't sing a love song
like the way it's meant to be
well i guess i'm not that good anymore
but baby that's just me
and i will love you baby always
and i'll be there forever and a day always
i'll be there till the stars don't shine
till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
and i know when i die you'll be on my mind
and i'll love you always
now your pictures that you left behind
are just memories of a different life
some that made us laugh
some that made us cry
one that made you have to say good bye
what i'd give to run my fingers through your hair
to touch your lips to hold you near
when you say your prayers try to understand
i've made mistakes i'm just a man
when he holds you close
when he pulls you near
when he says the words
you've been needing to hear
i'll wish i was him cause these words are mine
to say to you till the end of time
and i will love you baby always
and i'll be there forever and a day always
if you told me to cry for you i could
if you told me to die for you i would
take a look at my face
there's no price i won't pay
to say these words to you
well there ain't no luck in this loaded dice
but baby if you give me just one more try
we can pack up our old dreams and our old lives
we'll find a place where the sun still shines
and i will love you baby always
and i'll be there forever and a day always
i'll be there till the stars don't shine
till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
and i know when i die you'll be on my mind
and i'll love you always"
"sitting here, wasted and wounded
at this old piano
trying hard to capture the moment
this morning i don't know
'cause a bottle of vodka
is still lodged in my head
and some blond gave me nightmares
i think that she's still in my bed
as i dream about movies
they won't make of me when i'm dead
with an ironclad fist i wake up
and french kiss the morning
while some marching band keeps
it's own beat in my head
while we're talking
about all of the things that i long to believe
about love, the truth
and what you mean to me
and the truth is baby, you're all that i need
i wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight i sleep on a bed of nails
i wanna be just as close as the holy ghost is
and lay you down on a bed of roses
well, i'm so far away
that each step that i take is on my way home
a king's ransom in dimes i'd give each night
just to see through this payphone
still i run out of time
or it's hard to get through
till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
i'll just close my eyes and whisper
baby, blind love is true
i wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight i sleep on a bed of nails
i wanna be just as close as the holy ghost is
and lay you down on a bed of roses
well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry
the barkeeper's wig's crooked
and she's giving me the eye
well, i might have said yeah
but i laughed so hard i think i died
when you close your eyes
know i'll be thinking about you
while my mistress, she calls me
to stand in her spotlight again
tonight i won't be alone
but you know that don't
mean i'm not lonely
i've got nothing to prove
for it's you that i'd die to defend
i wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight i sleep on a bed of nails
i wanna be just as close as the holy ghost is
and lay you down
i wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
for tonight i sleep on a bed of nails
i wanna be just as close as the holy ghost is
and lay you down on a bed of roses"
"i guess this time you're really leaving
i heard your suitcase say goodbye
and as my broken heart lies bleeding
you say true love is suicide
you say you've cried a thousand rivers
and now you're swimming for the shore
you left me drowning in my tears
and you won't save me anymore
i'll pray to god to give me one more chance, girl
i'll be there for you
these five words i swear to you
when you breathe i wanna be the air for you
i'll be there for you
i'd live and i'd die for you
i'll steal the sun from the sky for you
words can't say what love can do
i'll be there for you
i know you know we've had some good times
now they have their own hiding place
i can promise you tomorrow
but i can't buy back yesterday
and baby you know my hands are dirty
but i wanted to be your valentine
i'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
when you get drunk, i'll be the wine
i'll be there for you
these five words i swear to you
when you breathe i wanna be the air for you
i'll be there for you
i'd live and i'd die for you
i'll steal the sun from the sky for you
words can't say what love can do
i'll be there for you
and i wasn't there when you were happy
i wasn't there when you were down
i didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
i wish i'd seen you blow those candles out
i'll be there for you
these five words i swear to you
when you breathe i wanna be the air for you
i'll be there for you
i'd live and i'd die for you
i'll steal the sun from the sky for you
words can't say what love can do
i'll be there for

"should i? could i?
have said the wrong things right a thousand times
if i could just rewind, i see it in my mind
if i could turn back time, you'd still be mine
you cried, i died
i should have shut my mouth, things headed south
as the words slipped off my tongue,
they sounded dumb
if this old heart could talk,
it'd say you're the one
i'm wasting time when i think about it
i should have drove all night,
i would have run all the lights
i was misunderstood
i stumbled like my words, did the best i could
damn, misunderstood
could i? should i?
apologize for sleeping on the couch that night
staying out too late with all my friends
you found me passed out in the yard again
you cried, i tried
to stretch the truth, but didn't lie
it's not so bad when you think about it
i should have drove all night,
i would have run all the lights
i was misunderstood
i stumbled like my words, did the best i could
i 'm hanging outside your door
i've been here before
misunderstood
i stumbled like my words, did the best i could
damn, misunderstood
intentions good
it's you and i, just think about it...
i should have drove all night
i would have run all the lights
i was misunderstood
i stumbled like my words, did the best i could

"i was walking around, just a face in the crowd
trying to keep myself out of the rain
saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
wondered if i might end up the same
there's a man out on the corner, singing old songs about change
everybody got their cross to bare, these days
she came looking for some shelter with a suitcase full of dreams
to a motel room on the boulevard
i guess she's trying to be james dean
she's seen all the disciples and all the wanna be's
no one wants to be themselves these days
still there's nothing to hold on to but these days
these days   the stars seem out of reach
these days   there ain't a ladder on the streets
these days   are fast, nothing last in this graceless age
there ain't anybody left but us these days
jimmy shoes busted both his legs, trying to learn to fly
from a second story window, he just jumped and closed his eyes
his mamma said he was crazy   he said mamma ""i've got to try""
don't you know that all my heroes died
and i guess i'd rather die than fade away
these days   the stars ain't out of reach
but these days   there ain't a ladder on the streets
these days   are fast, nothing lasts, it's a graceless age
even innocence has caught the midnight train
and there ain't anybody left but us these days
i know rome's still burning
though the times have changed
this world keeps turning round and round and round and round
these days
these days   the stars ain't out of reach
these days   there ain't a ladder on the streets
these days   are fast, nothing lasts
there ain't no time to waste
there ain't anybody left to take the blame
and there ain't anybody left but us these days
there ain't anybody left but us these days"
"i should have seen it coming when the roses died
should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
i should have listened when you said good night
you really meant good bye
baby ain't it funny how you never ever learn to fall
you're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall
but only fools are know it alls and i've played that fool for you
i cried and cried
there were nights that i died for you baby
i tried and i tried to deny it that your love drove me crazy baby
if the love that i got for you is gone
if the river i've cried ain't that long
then i'm wrong yeah i'm wrong
this ain't a love song
baby i thought you and me would
stand the test of time
like we got away with the perfect crime
but we were just a legend in my mind
i guess that i was blind
remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
the clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
you and i were the renegades some things never change
it made me so mad 'cause i wanted it bad for us baby
and now it's so sad that whatever we had
ain't worth saving oh oh oh
if the love that i've got for you is gone
if the river i've cried ain't that long
then i'm wrong yes i'm wrong
this ain't a love song
if the pain that i'm feeling so strong
is the reason that i'm holding on
then i'm wrong yeah i'm wrong
this ain't a love song
i cried and i cried
there were nights that i died for you baby
i tried and i tried to deny it that
your love drove me crazy
if the love that i got for you is gone
if the river i cried ain't that long

i've got an old coat for a pillow
and the earth was last night's bed
i don't know where i'm going
only god knows where i've been

a six gun lover
a candle in the wind
when you're brought into this world
they say you're born in sin

i want to say sometimes
there´s no one here but you and me
and that broken old street light
lock the doors
leave the world outside
all i´ve got to give to you
are these five words and i
thank you for loving me
for being my eyes
when i couldn´t see
for parting my lips
when i couldn´t breathe
thank you for loving me
thank you for loving me
i never knew i had a dream
until that dream was you
when i look into your eyes
the sky´s a different blue
cross my heart
i wear no disguise
if i tried, you´d make believe
that you believed my lies
thank you for loving me
for being my eyes
when i couldn´t see
for parting my lips
when i couldn´t breathe
thank you for loving me
you pick me up when i fall down
you ring the bell before they count me out
if i was drowning you would part the sea
and risk your own life to rescue me
lock the doors
leave the world outside
all i´ve got to give to you
are these five words and i
thank you for loving me
for being my eyes
when i couldn´t see
for parting my lips

i'm wanted dead or alive
wanted dead or alive
sometimes i sleep, sometimes it's not for days
the people i meet always go their separate places
sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
and times when you're all alone all you do is think
and i'm a cowboy, on a steel horse i ride
i'm wanted  dead or alive
wanted  dead or alive
oh and i ride!
i'm a cowboy, on a steel horse i ride
i'm wanted  dead or alive

gonna work itself out

that a man walks
when a bird can fly
we have to kick the ground
the stars kiss the sky
they say that spirits live
a man has to die
they promised us truth
now they're giving us lies
gonna take a miracle to save us this time
and your savior has just left town
gonna need a miracle
'cause it's all on the line
and i won't let you down
the river of your hope is flooding
and i know the dam is busted
if you need me i'll come running
i won't let you down... no, no
you're looking for salvation
you thought that it'd be shining
like an angel's light
well, the angels left this nation
and salvation caught the last train
out tonight
he lost one hell of a fight
he said
i'm just one man, that's all i'll ever be
i never can be everything you wanted from me
i've got big plans, so big
that any blind man could see
i'm standing in the river
now i'm drowning in the sea
gonna take a miracle to save us this time
and your savior has just left town
gonna need a miracle

and your heartbeat is slowing down
your feet are grounded still
you're reaching for the sky
you can let 'em clip your wings
'cause i believe that you can fly
solo
well my eyes have seen the horror
of the coming of the flood
i've driven deep the thorny crown
into the soul of someone's son
still i'll look you in the eye
'cause i've believed in things i've thought
and i'll die without regret
for the wars i have fought
gonna take a miracle to save you this time
and your savior has just left town
gonna need a miracle
'cause your heart's doing time
and your conscience is calling you out
it ain't all for nothing
life ain't written in the sand

the night about to end
i pass my time as a stranger

on butler street out in the dark
remember when we lost the keys

remember how we used to talk
about busting out   we´d break their hearts
together   forever
chorus:
never say goodbye, never say goodbye
you and me and my old friends
hoping it would never end
never say goodbye, never say goodbye
holdin' on   we got to try
holdin' on to never say goodbye
remember days of skipping school
racing cars and being cool
with a six pack and the radio
we didn't need no place to go
remember at the prom that night
you and me we had a fight
but the band they played our favorite song
and i held you in my arms so strong
we danced so close
we danced so slow
and i swore i'd never let you go
together   forever
never say goodbye, never say goodbye
you and me and my old friends
hoping it would never end
never say goodbye, never say goodbye
holdin' on   we got to try
holdin' on to never say goodbye

when's your daddy gonna talk to you
she was living in an other world
tryin' to get her message through
no one heard a single word you said
they should've seen it in your eyes
what was going round your head
ooh, she's a little runaway
daddy's girl learned fast
all those things she couldn't say
ooh she's a little runaway
a different line every night, guaranteed to blow your mind
i see you out on the streets
combing for a wild time
so you sit home alone 'cause there's nothing left that you can do
there's only pictures hung in the shadows
left there to look at you
you know she likes the lights at night on the neon broadway signs
she don't really mind
it's only love she hopes to find
ooh, she's a little runaway
daddy's girl learned fast
all those things she couldn't say
ooh she's a little runaway
no one heard a single word you said
they should have seen it in your eyes
what was going round your head
ooh, she's a little runaway
daddy's girl learned fast
all those things he couldn't say
ooh she's a little runaway
daddy's girl learned fast
now she was the night away"
"chorus:
hey man, i'm alive
i'm takin' each day a night at a time
i'm feeling like a monday, but someday i'll be saturday night
hey, my name is jim, where did i go wrong
my life's a bargain basement, all the good shit's gone
i just can't hold a job, where do i belong
been sleeping in my car, my dreams moved on
my name is billy jean, my love was bought and sold
i'm only sixteen, i feel a hundred years old
my foster daddy went and took my innocence away
the street life ain't much better but at least i'm getting paid
tuesday just might go my way
it can't get worse than yesterday
thursdays, fridays aint been kind
but somehow i survive
chorus
hey, man, i'm alive
i'm taking each day and night at a time
yeah, i'm down but i know i'll get by
hey, hey, hey, hey man, i've got to live my life
like i ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
i'm feeling like a monday
but someday i'll be saturday night
now i can't say my name or tell you where i am
i wanna blow myself away, don't know if i can
i wish that i could be in some other time and place
with someone else's soul and someone else's face
tuesday just might go my way
can't get worse than yesterday
thursdays, fridays aint been kind
but somehow i'll survive
hey, man i'm alive
i'm taking each day a night at a time
yeah, i'm down but i know i'll get by
hey, hey, hey, hey man i got to live my life
i'm gonna pick up all the pieces and what's left of my pride
i'm feeling like a monday but, someday i'll be saturday night
saturday night

someday i'll be saturday night
i'll be back on my feet, i'll be doing all right
it may not be tomorrow, baby thats ok

"sitting here just watching you sleep
wish i could slip inside and be
in some technicolor dream
but the air's too thick for one of us to breathe
i'm not fool enough to think
you couldn't live life without me
i didn't come this far to throw the towel in
i didn't fight this hard to walk away
if i ain't smart enough to say i'm sorry
it's just because the words got in the way
i remember how it used to be
i was you and you were me
we were more than just the same
now these shoes don't fit, my skin's too tight
when you want a kiss, i take a bite
let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights
last night i drank enough to drown
raise a toast to your good looks and to my health
look, we both know how much i've let you down
janie don't you take your love to town
janie don't you take your love to town
janie don't you take your love to town
if i've got to beg, i'll beg, just don't walk away
janie don't you take your love to town
you deserve a shooter, a saint
someone to give it to you straight
to find the soul throught flesh and bone
my life's a treasure, full of sunny weather
but it's left me feeling cold
now all you want to do is take me home
i hated you, the night you said you loved me
i hated you, 'cause i couldn't love myself
i'm begging you now, baby please just hold me
i got one foot in, one foot off the ground
janie don't you take your love to town
janie don't you take your love to town
if i've got to beg, i'll beg, just don't walk away
janie don't you take your love to town
sitting here while you're fast asleep
in the bathroom by the sink
trying to write the right words down
i turn out the lights, close my eyes
there ain't no prayers or kiss goodnight
what i'll forget to say tomorrow, i'll say now
janie don't you take your love to town
janie don't you take your love to town
janie don't you take your love to town
if i've got to beg, i'll beg, just don't walk away
janie don't you take your love to town"
"they say that no man is an island
and good things come to those who wait
but the things i hear are there
just to remind me
every dog will have his day
the spirits they intoxicate me
i watched them infiltrate my soul
they try to say it's too late for me
tell my guns i'm coming home
i swear i'm gonna live forever
tell my maker he can wait
i'm riding somewhere south of heaven
heading back to santa fe
it's judgment day in santa fe
once i was promised absolution
there's only one solution for my sins
you gotta face your ghosts and know
with no illusions
that only one of you is going home again
and i blame this world for making
a good man evil
it's this world that can drive a good man mad
and it's this world that turns a killer into a hero
well i blame this world for making
a good man bad
now i ain't getting into heaven
if the devil has his way
i swear i'm gonna live forever
heading back to santa fe
got debts to pay in santa fe
it's judgment day in santa fe
solo
so i save a prayer
for when i need it most
to the father, son
and the holy ghost
and sign it from a sinner
with no name
when i meet my maker
will he close the book
on the hearts i broke
and the lives i took
will he walk away
'cause my soul's
too late to save
now i ain't getting into heaven
if the devil has his way
i swear i'm gonna live forever
heading back to santa fe
got debts to pay in santa fe
it's judgment day in santa fe"
"rainy night and worked all day
we both got jobs cause there's bills to pay

i don't need nothing when i'm by your side
we got something that'll never die
our dreams, our pride
my heart beats like a drum flesh to flesh, one to one and i'll never let go cause
there's something i know deep inside
you were born to be my baby
and baby, i was made to be your man
chorus
we got something to believe in
even if we don't know where we stand
only god would know the reasons
but i bet he must have had a plan
cause you were born to be my baby

light a candle, blow the world away
table for two on a tv tray
it ain't fancy, baby that's ok
our time, our way
so hold me close better hang on tight
buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
we're two kids hitching down the road of life
our world, our fight
if we stand side by side there's a chance we'll get by and i'll know that you'll be live
in my heart till the day i die
cause you were born to be my baby

the autumn wind is creeping in
the summer sun packed up it's long gone
there's a whole lot of leaving going on, yeah
i'll bet it's warm in california
i think it's time to hit the road
i just might call that band of gypsies
go searching for our pot of gold
seems like lately there's a whole lotta leaving goin' on
i close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
i still hear your voice, it takes me back to that time
where i can find a reason to be strong
seems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
close the window, draw the curtains
you ain't the only one here hurtin
no one's right, no one's wrong
lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
you used to live to say you love me
now you got one foot out of the door
its then you turn around and ask me
do we got it anymore?
i close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
i still hear your voice
it takes me back to that time

i close my eyes and picture your hand in mine
yeah, i walk for a line
you'll never hear me say good bye
so pretty baby, please be strong

"i've heard there was
a secret chord
that david played, and
it pleased the lord
but you don't really care
for music, do you?
it goes like this:
the fourth, the fifth
the minor fall, the major lift
the baffled king
composing hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
your faith was strong
but you needed proof
you saw her bathing
on the roof
her beauty and the
moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to a kitchen chair
she broke your throne
and she cut your hair
and from your lips
she drew the hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
maybe i've been here before
i've seen this room
i've walked this floor
i used to live alone
before i knew you
i've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and
it's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
there was a time
you let me know
what's real and going on below
but now you never show
it to me, do you?
i remember when
i moved in, you
your holy dark
was moving too
and every breath we drew
was hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
maybe there's a god above
and all i ever
learned from love
was how to shoot
at somebody
who outdrew you
it's not a cry
you can hear at night
it's not somebody
who's seen the light
it's a cold and
it's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah"

whatcha gonna learn in school

who lied to change her life
she changed her name,her face
because the grass looked
greener on the other side
she turned her back, she ran away
straight into the night
her friends, her family feel the pain,
but she's the one who cries
tell me what you want
tell me what you need
i want everything

his brother come home,
found him dead on the floor
with a needle in his vein
cops came down with a body bag,

i run to you
baby, i can always run
to a heart of chrome
and a soul of steel
we've done more white lines than you'll know any one we could steal
and when i give her the gun
you know she feels so right
and we don't let go when we're alone when i'm holding her so tight
she's got something i want man, it's something i need
it takes more than the night to satisfy me
i stand accused
i can always run to you
any road that you choose
i can always run to you
i stand accused
i can always run to you
i run to you
baby, i can always run
and when the morning comes and i go to sleep
when i close my eyes she's waiting for me
i know that tonight she'll satisfy me
i stand accused
i can always run to you
any road that you choose
i can always run to you
i stand accused
i can always run to you
i run to you
baby, i can always run"
"last night i had a dream
the dream i had was true
i fell through the stars
went walking on the moon
burned like a thousand candles in her arms
her skin under my fingertips
the honeysuckle on her lips
sweeter than a man deserves to taste
mercy mercy, what else can i say?
but amen
amen
amen
last night we were born together
it was like we'd always been
i'll be with her forever
if i don't see her again
we poured the wine until our cup ran over
unfolding like some mystery
inside of her like poetry
a thousand horses running through my veins
mercy mercy what else can i say
but amen
amen
i laid down in her garden
naked on her floor
windows up, those curtains blowing
she don't lock the door
amen
amen
at the banquet table
a beggar at a feast
i felt her tongue between my lips
and i forgot to breath
we stayed there 'til the candles burned the carpet
last night i had a dream
the dream i had was true
mercy mercy, what else can i say
mercy mercy, i'll kneel down and prayed
amen
amen
amen
amen"

love lives in new york city
he got a place off of the park
but he was standing in the ruins
and in his hand's a broken heart
he called an army of his angels
i hear they had to hide their wings
it was them who brought you water
if you listen closely; i know you can hear the choir sing
hey halleluiah baby, rise up
hold out your hands and reach higher
get up on your feet, rise up
let it flow through you baby
running through your veins
like a healing rain
everywhere you'll see
another reason to believe
south of canal street
right there in a mother's eyes
at a table in a restaurant window
in a taxi passing by
i saw love go running up that stairwell
and the sky came falling down
it was him and a newborn baby's cry
he was there to make that sound
keeps this whole world spinning around
say halleluiah baby, rise up
hold out your hands and reach higher
get up on your feet, rise up
let it flow through you baby
running through your veins
like a healing rain
everywhere you'll see
say halleluiah baby
it's different than it was before
now we need it even more
fire falling from the sky
innocence just said goodbye
it may never be the same
maybe it was time to change
time to grieve, time to cry
time to live, time to fly
sing halleluiah baby, rise up
hold out your hands and reach higher
get up on your feet, rise up
let it flow through you baby
running through your veins
like a healing rain
rise up
hold out your hands and reach higher
get up on your feet, rise up

a mother and two children

a mother and her son
against a little girl of 6 years old

through all the neighborhood
they said i got some news to tell you folks

somehow something happened
someone got away
someone got the answers
for what happened here today

tell me it was just a dream – august 7, 4:15
god close his eyes & the world got mean
august 7, 4:15
now the people from the papers
and the local tv news
tried to find the reason
cop dogs sniffed around for clues
someone shouted “hit & run”
the coroner cried “foul”
her blue dress was what she wore
the day they laid her body down
oh no, ho no, oh no, no, no, no
tell me it was just a dream – august 7, 4:15

billy, billy
ain't love hard to explain?
for a debutante you're a real hard woman
but i love you just the same
how come you're sad when i get happy?
why do you laugh when i want to cry?
tell me why when i say i need you
you turn around and you say goodbye
why do you think that a heart's so fragile?
can you tell me why love's so blind?
just like a magnet you pull me under
i can't resist you, we're two of a kind
chorus:
billy, billy
ain't love hard to explain?
for a debutante you're a real hard wmoan
but i love you just the same
billy , billy
we're better lovers than friends
life is like a movie but this ain't pretend
there really doesn't have to be a happy end
chorus:
billy, billy
ain't love hard to explain?
for a debutante you're a real hard woman
but i love you just the same
i never said you had to walk on water
or that i could ever stop the rain
some times we break up just to make up, baby
and we don't care who's to blame
billy, billy
ain't love hard to explain?
for a debutante you're a real hard woman
but i love you just the same
billy, billy

"i just seen trouble

chorus
billy get your guns
there's trouble blowing like a hurricane
billy get your guns
that's the price on your head for the
price of fame
and it'll never change
billy get your guns
there's a whiskey bottle empty
sittin' on the bar
billy get your guns
and some organ grinder singing
about some sucker moving on
billy get your guns
all the whores are hanging out
waiting to get paid
billy get your guns
from some johnny on the spot
who said hey keep the change baby
billy get your guns
there's trouble blowing like a hurricane

"we met some time ago when we were almost young
it never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from
i didn't have much money so i stole you a rose
you were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothes
i never thought i'd lose you, no i'd rather go blind
i thought i saw the future but the fortune teller lied
your love was my salvation, it could always get me high
what was once holy water tastes like bitter wine
i know i wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes
when i was choking on the words to say
you stuck your fingers down my throat
the first night i said i loved you
you told me to go to hell
you were giving me head on that creaky old bed
at the old duval motel
just like everything even good love has to die
ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye
your love was my salvation, it could always get me high
what was once holy water tastes like bitter wine
oh yeah
just like everything good love has to die
ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye
no one even cried, we were one of a kind
one of a kind, yeah
love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by
what was once holy water tastes like bitter wine
your love was my salvation, it could always get me high
you take the bath of holy water, now all that's left is bitter wine"
"wooh!
ooh yeah!
comon'!
first time i heard the music
i thought it was my own
i could feel it in my heartbeat
i could feel it in my bones
my momma thinks i'm crazy
dad says i'm insane
i got this boogie woogie fever
burning in my veins
they took me to a doctor
but it's too late for me
they dragged me to a preacher
that they saw on their tv
who said that for a small donation
my lost soul would be saved
i said i don't think so preacher
i'll come back another day
all i want, is to be a rolling stone
they don't understand what we all know
it feels so good that it ought to be illegal
i got my vaccination from a phonagraph needle
i'll never grow up and i'll never grow old
blame it on the love of rock & roll
my teachers didn't like me they always
tried to put me down
'cause i wore my hair too long
i played my music way too loud
every little boy wants to learn to play guitar
so he can pick up all the chicks
and be a rock n roll star
they said it won't last, but they misunderstood
if people think it's bad then i'll be bad for good
it feels so good that it ought to be illegal
i got my vaccination from a phonagraph needle
i'll never grow up and i'll never grow old
blame it on the love of rock & roll blame it on the love, blame it on the love
dad don't understand what the little girls know
blame it on the love of rock n roll
all i wanted, all i ever needed
my guitar gave to me
every song i've sung blame it on love
every war i've won blame it on love
everything i've done blame it on love
blame it on the love of rock n roll
it feels so good that it ought to be illegal
i got my vaccination from a phonagraph needle
i'll never grow up and i'll never grow old
blame it on the love of rock & roll
blame it on the love, blame it on the love
dad don't get what the little girls know
blame it on the love of rock n roll"

"hey patty garrett that's what i used to call you
they tell me you want me but i hear they've got you
they made you a lawman with a badge made of silver
they paid you some money to sell them my blood
but you say this ain't about me, this ain't about you
or the good and the bad times we've both been through
when the lines between brothers and justice have changed
you do what you've got to cause you can't walk away
i wonder what would have happened
if you were the killer
and i was the hero
would things be the same
or would i have traded
your life for my own life
would i have paid
your debts in your place
but this ain't about me, this ain't about you
or the good and the bad times we've both been through
when the lines between brothers and justice have changed
you do what you've got to cause you can't walk away

one on one
we'd still be standing
when all was said and done
blood on blood
one on one
and i'll be here for you
till kingdom come
blood on blood
well, bobby was our hero
cause he had a fake i.d.
i got busted stealing cigarettes
and he took the rap for me
danny knew this white trash girl
we each threw in a ten
she took us to this cheap motel
and turned us into men
we were so young one for all and all for one just as sure as the river's gonna run
blood on blood
one on one
we'd still be standing
when all is said and done
blood on blood
one on one
and i'll be here for you
till kingdom come

now bobby, he's an uptown lawyer
danny, he's a medicine man
and me, i'm just the singer
in a long haired rock'n'roll band
through the years and miles between us
it's been a long and lonely ride
but if i got a call in the dead of the night
i'd be right by your side
blood on blood, blood on blood

one on one
we'd still be standing
when all is said and done

i can't stand the heat
on my heart on fire
i'm burning for love
i'm filled with desire
i can't stand the heat
on my heart on fire
i can't get enough
its down to the wire
i'm making my move, i'm looking for you
i'm burning for love
lyrics by arthur magalhães"
"dressed up for a big date
like halloween day but it was fourth of july now
a car crash with a suitcase and a painted face
she was one of a kind
she wears a plastic crown like cinderella
and roller skates in bed
he rides the greyhound from his hometown
when he comes around cause they don't let him drive now
mixed up as a milkshake
but make no mistake
crash looking at the stars
chorus:
you and me
we're invincible together
we can be also tragical, whatever
dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar
captain crash and the beauty queen from mars
share a toothpick, trading lipstick
watching traffic for days at the diner
holding hands, making big plans
playing superman, he was wearing eyeliner
another local legend and his longtime lucky charm
chorus
they're drunk on love as you can get
getting high on lust and cigarettes
living life with no regrets
at least they're gonna try to fly
chorus:
you and me
we're invincible together
we can be also tragical, whatever
we're cid and nancy
fred and ginger
clyde and bonnie
liz and richard
kurt and courtney
baccal and bogie
joltin' joe and mrs. monroe
here's captain crash and the beauty queen from mars"

"you said you loved to watch me sleep
you put your head down on my chest
to hear me breathe
go on, take my last breath from me
i don't want to live no more
and cut my eyes so i can't see
i can't see you looking back as you walk out the door
cold, hard heart
cold, cruel heart
what's it gonna take
to break your cold hard heart
i was a lover lost at sea
you found me washed up on the beach
you took me home, you gave me breakfast
i said i'd offer you protection, but you didn't charge a fee
cold, hard heart
cold, cruel heart
what's it gonna take
to break your cold hard heart
cold, cruel heart
cold, cruel heart
what's it gonna take
to break your cold hard heart
what are you hiding underneath that shirt
if you're the one to run babe
then you don't feel the hurt
her hair so brown, and eyes so green
you used to say i made good company
she'd bring me wine and sip her tea
then you'd give yourself what you could give to me
cold, hard heart
cold, cruel heart
what's it gonna take
to break your cold hard heart
cold, cruel heart
cold, cruel heart
what's it gonna take
to break your cold hard heart
what's it gonna take..."

crazy, i'm crazy for feeling so lonely
i'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
i knew you'd love me as long as you wanted
and then someday you'd leave me for somebody new.
worry, why do i let myself worry?
wonderin', what in the world did i do?
crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
i'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying

"the city sounds like a symphony
a cabbie screams obscenities
the horns are honking jazz in the night
her street is lit like a christmas tree
this place is my amphetamine
she junks me but it's alright
in her summer dress she parts the sea
her hair wrapped up in rosary beads
everyone else is gone but her and me
chorus:
here she comes, it's crazy love
here it comes again
that crazy thing called love
here she comes, it's crazy love
here it comes again
sitting on my stoop
i lit one up and put the ashes in my coffee cup
and watched the world passing me by
throw a coat of paint on this rusty heart
ain't it funny how life imitates art
saint valentine he's got bloody knees tonight
but when she's walking down the street
the sidewalk's there to kiss her feet
chorus:
here she comes, it's crazy love
here it comes again
that crazy thing called love
here she comes, it's crazy love
here it comes again
she needs me, pleads me
wraps me in her loving charms
she'll tease me, squeeze me
but i'm the man when i'm in her arms
now the angels sing a melody
that they wrote for her explicitly
that no one hears but her and me
now wait a minute… wait i can't believe my eyes
who's that coming around the corner?
ay, she's lookin' fine ain't she? … get out the way!
no, no, no get out the way… look at those high heel sneakers…
chorus:
here she comes, it's crazy love
here it comes again
that crazy thing called love
here she comes, it's crazy love"
"i'm lying here beside you
in someone else's bed
knowing what were doing's wrong
but better left unsaid
your breathing sounds like screaming, it's all that i can stand
his ring is on your finger, but my heart is in your hands
damned if you love me   damned if you don't
it's getting harder holding on, but i can't let you go
damned if you don't need me, damned if you do
god , i wish it wasn't me standing in these shoes
damned, damned
a door slams like a shotgun, you jump up to your feet
but it's just the wind blowing through the secrets that we keep
made me want to want you, god knows i need to need you
by the time the love is over, i'll be sleeping on the streets
damned if you love me   damned if you don't
it's getting harder holding on, but i can't let you go
damned if you don't need me, damned if you do
god , i wish it wasn't me standing in these shoes
why won't you talk to me ? because i'm too blind to see
why won't you look at me ? because i'm afraid to breathe
what do you want from me ? all that i can stand
the lies are on my tongue and i can't turn back i know
the soul is damned
don't worry
i ain't gonna call you or hear you say my name
and if you see me on the street, don't wave just walk away
our lives are getting twisted, let's keep our stories straight
the more that i resist it, my temptation turns to fate
damned if you love me   damned if you don't
it's getting harder holding on, but i can't let you go
damned if you don't need me, damned if you do
god , i wish it wasn't me standing in these shoes
damned , damned
damned if you love me   damned if you don't
it's getting harder holding on, but i can't let you go
damned if you don't need me, damned if you do

hey, hey, hey i'm gonna make it through

does anybody really give their heart to somebody?

on this roller coaster ride
there's a lonely world around me
i get sucked in by the tide
i said, hey, love ain't no crime

"across the border they turn
water into wine
some say it's the devil's blood
they're squeezing from the vine
some say it's a saviour
in these hard and desperate times
for me it helps me to forget
that we're just born to die
i came here like so many did
to find the better life
to find my piece of easy street
to finally be alive
and i know nothing good comes easy
all good things take some time
i made my bed i lie in it
to die in it's the crime
you can't help but prosper
when the street are paved with gold
they say the oil wells ran deeper here
than anybody's known
i packed up on my wife and kid
and left them back at home
now there's nothing in this paydirt
the ghost are all i know
now the oil's gone
the money's gone
and the jobs are gone
still we're hangin' on
down in dry county
they're swimming in the sand
praying for some holy water
to wash the sins from off our hands
here in dry county
the promise has run dry
where nobody cries
and no one's getting out of here alive
in the blessed name of jesus
i heard a preacher say
that we are god's children
and that he'd be back someday
and i hoped that he knew
something as he drank his cup of wine
i didn't have too good of a feeling
as i head out to the night
i cursed the sky to open
i begged the clouds for rain
i prayed to god for water
for this burning in my veins
it was like my soul's on fire
and i had to watch the flames
all my dreams went up in ashes
and my future blew away
now the oil's gone
the money's gone
and the jobs are gone
still we're hangin' on
down in dry county
they're swimming in the sand
praying for some holy water
to wash the sins from off our hands
here in dry county
the promise has run dry
where nobody cries
and no one's getting out of here alive
men spend their whole lives
waiting praying for their big reward
but it seems sometimes
the payoff leaves you feeling
like a dirty whore
if i could choose the way i'll die
make it by the gun or knife
'couse the other way there's too much pain
night after night after night...
down in dry county
they're swimming in the sand
praying for some holy water
to wash the sins from off our hands
here in dry county
the promise has run dry
where nobody cries
and no one's getting out of here alive"
"a whiskey bottle comforts me
and tells me not to cry
while a full moon says a prayer for me
i try to close my eyes
but the night's there to remind me
of the guns and the early graves
the ghosts appear as i fall asleep
to sing an outlaw's serenade
dyin' ain't much of a livin'
when you're livin' on the run
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
is it too late to ask for forgiveness
for the things that i have done
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
the desert's been a friend to me
it covers me by night
and a snakebite's not my enemy
but it taught me how to fight
all this fame don't bring you freedom
though it wears a thin disguise
when an outlaw is just a man to me
and a man has to die
dyin' ain't much of a livin'
when you're livin' on the run
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
is it too late to ask for forgiveness
for the things that i have done
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
and i hope someone will pray for me
when it's my turn to die... pray for me !!!
dyin' ain't much of a livin'
when you're livin' on the run
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
is it too late to ask for forgiveness
for the things that i have done
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young"
"and there i stood just like a soldier,
i was tough until i saw her.
i said ""hello"" but she just turned away.
""hey romeo, watcha doin with my girl,
who are you using now?""
i turned and walked away.
i'm gonna need you now, you can't believe it.
i'll be there to catch her when she falls.
oooh, here i am
on the edge of a broken heart
i'm a man
on the edge of a broken heart
here we stand
on the edge of a broken heart
so what if you can't cause you know
i'm a man on the edge
on the edge of a broken heart
i'm on the edge
on the edge of a broken heart
i'm on the outside looking inside,
you're with him, who's on the roster now?
do you still think of me?
i tried to call, but no one answers,
just silohuets, or private dancer
lights go dim
as the music starts to fade away.
i turned and walked away
i'm gonna need you now,
you can believe it
i'll be there to catch you when you fall.
you better believe
i'm a man
on the edge of a broken heart
here i am
on the edge of a broken heart

i'm a man on the edge
on the edge of a broken heart
i'm on the edge
on the edge of a broken heart
and when i hold out my hands,
i'll be reaching for you.
i'll give it all that i've got,
that's all i can do.
when you're waiting for love,
i'll be waiting for you.
on the edge of a broken heart
waiting for you
on the edge of a broken heart
waiting for you
on the edge of a broken heart
so run if you can
so what if you can't cause you know
i'm a man on the edge
on the edge of a broken heart...."
"as a hard rain beats down in the night it sounds like
applause
still i can't hear a sound with the beat of my heart
i can't pick up that phone anymore and i need to
confess
if i don't say 'i love you' everything else is a waste
of my breathe
chorus:
every beat of my heart i would give
every beat of my heart just to live
to live for your love, if all that i want
is to die in your arms
i'd give you every beat of my heart
as i whisper your name i wish you were here by my
side
and the only way that i find you is when i close my
eyes
with my ring on your finger i hope and i pray
that you know deep in your soul with every step that
you take
chorus:
every beat of my heart i would give
every beat of my heart just to live
i live for your love, if all that i want
is to die in your arms
i'd give you every beat of my heart
it's the little things that you do that make me want
you more
it's the way your hands are trembling but what they
trembling for?
it's the way the smile fits on your lips
the way you hold me tight
god knows i'd give everything to be in your arms
tonight
chorus:
i live for your love, it's all that i want
is to die in your arms
i'd give you every beat of my heart
just to live
every beat of my heart, just to live
i live for your love, it's all that i want
to die in your arms
i'd give you every beat of my heart
give you every beat of my heart
give you every beat of my heart
give you every beat of my heart
give you every beat of my heart"
"i've been staring at the page
for what seems like days
i guess i put this one off for a while
did i see a tear fall from your eyes
or did you laugh so hard that you cried
when i served my secrets on a silver tray to you
hey now, i guess the night's just bringing me down
chorus:
there's no love, there's no hate
i left them there for you to take
but, know that every word was a piece of my heart
you've been the blood in my veins
the only one who knows my middle name
and the smiles they came easy 'cause of you
you know that i love you, but i hate you
'cause i know i can never escape you
let the choir sing for tonight i'm an easy mark
hey now, am i acting just a little too proud
chorus
have i said too much
maybe i haven't said enough
but know that every word was a piece of my heart
hush me darling, maybe i've lost my touch
maybe i've lost my guts   there, is that truth enough
hey now, hey now
you know these love letters mix with whisky
just don't light a match when you kiss me
though i'll blow away, you know i'll be back soon
hey now, hey now, hey now, am i talking just a little too loud
chorus
have i said too much
maybe i haven't said enough
but know that every word was a piece of my heart
hey now, am i talking just a little too proud
hey now, the night's just bringing me down"

everybody's broken, in this life,
it's ok, to feel a little broken,
everybody's broken, your alright,

make yourself at home,
when you wonder why your breathing,
know your not alone,

it's easier to doubt,
you're trying to hold in,

who'd never let you look inside
i'd smile when i was crying
i had nothing but to a lot to lose
thought i had a lot to prove
in my life there's no denying
goodbye to all my yesterdays
goodbye, so long, i'm on my way
chorus: i had enough of crying, bleeding, sweating, dying
hear me when i say, gonna live my life everyday
i'm gonna touch the sky, spread these wings and fly
i ain't here to play
gonna live my life everyday
change, everybody's feelin' strange
never gonna be the same
makes you wonder how the world keeps turning
life, learning how to live my life
learning how to pick my fights
take my shots while i'm still burning
goodbye to all those rainy nights
goodbye, so long, i'm moving on
chorus: i've had enough of crying, bleeding, sweating, dying
hear me when i say, gonna live my life everyday
i'm gonna touch the sky, spread these wings and fly

there ain't nothing gonna get in my way

"it was christmas eve, babe
in the drunk tank
an old man said to me
""won't see another one""
and then he sang a song
the rare old mountain dew
i turned my face away
and dreamed about you
got on a lucky one
came in eighteen to one
i've got a feeling
this year's for me and you
so, happy christmas
i love you, baby
i can see a better time
when all our dreams come true
they've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
but the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
when you first took my hand on a cold christmas eve
you promised me broadway was waiting for me
you were handsome
you were pretty, queen of new york city
when the band finished playing
they howled out for more
sinatra was swinging
all the drunks, they were singing
we kissed on a corner
then danced through the night
the boys of the nypd choir
were singing ""galway bay""
and the bells were ringing out
for christmas day
you're a bum, you're a braggart
you've lost all your swagger
and the word around town is you ain't much in the bed
you're a squirrel cause you're nuts
you're a kick in the gut
happy christmas, my arse
i'll be glad it's our last
the boys of the nypd choir
still singing ""galway bay""
and the bells were ringing out
for christmas day
""i could have been someone""
well, so could anyone
you took my dreams from me
when i first found you
i kept them with me, babe
i put them with my own
can't make it all alone
i've built my dreams around you
the boys of the nypd choir
still singing ""galway bay""
and the bells are ringing out
for christmas day"
"how can i defend
let's live for now and not then
we're chasing tail lights, let 'em fade into the
distance
let's say the engine stalled and start again
turn around, let's turn around
it's a dark road we'd been heading down
trust me tonight
i swear i know where we are
we're gonna run all the lights
we're gonna blow right through the radar
fast cars
we are fast cars
how can i pretend
the signs don't say ""dead end""
so many hearts just wind up in a junkyard
and memories are nothing but spare parts
turn around, just turn around
we'll leave the past behind us now
come on, we ain't gonna crash
it's time we... rolling down
we'll pull ahead of the pack
slipping through the cracks
'cause we are
fast cars
on a long ride
take your foot off the brake
let's just put it in drive
we are fast cars
on the inside
there's no turning back
on the highway of life
fast cars
we are fast cars
shala, shala
flying through the stop signs
shala, shala
running over...
shala, shala
... down the daylight
... deep like white lines
holding on for our lives
we are fast cars
we are fast cars
on a long ride
take your foot off the brake
let's just put it in drive
we are fast cars

"i see you looking over your shoulder
tell me who do you think's out there
you're reaching for your four leaf clover
but baby there ain't no luck down there
i swear that there's no heart in this city
it's here the slogan reads ""do your time""
everybody's doing their sentence
it's just there ain't nobody here
who knows just what's the crime
i watched my father live a lie here
i'd rather die than fade away
i read the rules
and yeah i know them
still you ain't ever gonna
make me play the game of fear fear fear fear
running with the rats
through the city
makes you feel like you're a partner in crime
girl once you won't stop to watch
that little girl did
hey baby won't you stop and hear me
just being here we're breathing heart attacks
we can run and chase
the setting sun we can run
and we won't ever look back
take my hand i know we'll make it
i'll let nothing slow us down i know you want to curse
this place but there's only
one thing that's stopping us now
fear fear fear of a new thing fear fear fear
of the brass ring
you ain't one for taking chances
you work and live and breathe that 9 to 5
still that's what you call living
that's surviving to me
and surviving is living to die in
fear"

never know how much i care

an' fever all through the night
listen to me, baby

no one could love you the way i do
'cause they don't know how to love you my way

"there's no one watching over me tonight and
i'm afraid to turn out the lights,
if i close my eyes, it'll all go away and i
don't wanna see it end this way.
there was a time when truth and trust
meant so much more to each of us
and all the dreams that once we had have seen
the sun and left us feeling bad
now the changing of the guard has left us feeling so damn hard
i'll keep my business, but i'm a little bit afraid
through the years one thing hasn't changed
yeah, yeah, yeah hey
i would run through fields of fire,
i would crawl on broken glass,
just to swin in your sea of devotion,
just to have a second chance
that's all i ask
now feeling good is not good enough, i know
they've changed but not that much
midnight time has left us feeling beaten up, i
never was one who needs to give enough
i ain't a hero who gets the girl,
but if i had my chance to save the world
i won't blow it now, i guess i'll understand
this boy becoming a man
yeah, yeah, yeah hey
i would run through fields of fire,
i would crawl on broken glass,
just to swim in your sea of devotion,
just to have a second chance
that's all i ask
well, look at your hands if you hear what i said.
can you count on your fingers each of
your real friends
i know that i'm lucky, i know i'm right.
fingerst turn into fists, we're here
to take on the night.
that's right
now i'm staring at an open door,
we've had a lot and i want much more
you can keep all the money, and the streets that's painted gold
if someone gives me back my soul
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah hey
i would run through fields of fire,
i would crawl on broken glass
just to swim in your sea of devotion,
just to have a second chance
i would run through fields of fire,
i would run through fields of fire
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah,
i would run
all the way back home,
i would run,

"i gave you my fingerprints
left them all over you
tangled up in your sheets
this heartache's the only proof
i gave you my fingerprints

the man invisible
i'll be him from now on

they were running through your hair
you held one between your lips
and brought another there
the last time that i saw them
i haven't seen them since
no matter who or what i touch
i leave no evidence
i gave you my fingerprints
i said i'd give you everything
but who thought you'd take it all
does a promise really break
if nobody sees it fall
a hard rain can't wash away
the taste of your memory
don't know what i would do
if you should stop haunting me
the last time that i saw them
they were running through your hair
you held one between your lips
and brought another there
the last time that i saw them
unbuttoning your dress
those pretty pictures in my head
are the only thing you left
i gave you my fingerprints
that shiny box i gave to you
was all there was to me
all it was to you was just a faded memory
i gave her my fingerprints
guilty or innocent
i have to ask myself
would i do it all again
would i
the last time that i saw them
they were running through your hair
you held one between your lips
and brought another there
the last time that i saw them
i haven't seen them since
no matter who or what i touch
i leave no evidence
i gave you my finger prints"

about a buddy of mine who headed to an early grave

with a smile on his face

that cheap bass and guitar and our wildest dreams
we were searching for a savior like anybody else
trying to save ourselves from ourselves

"here we stand, caught between the cradle and the grave
in a world that gives you nothing but your name
with every step you take you must be brave
nothing lost is nothing gained
and i know lives are lost for crowns and kings
we all know love is lost for lesser things
and the angels here have broken wings
though i know somewhere a choir sings
chorus:
you gotta have a reason
a reason to believe
a reason just to dream
sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
a reason to believe
a hot headed hero, here you see i'm just a man
comes a time, a time to make a stand
so here i am with heart in hand
don't be afraid to understand
chorus:
you gotta have a reason
one reason to believe
a reason just to dream
sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
a reason to believe in trust,
i believe in faith
i believe in us
'til my dying day
you gotta have a reason
you gotta have a reason
if all we've got is you and me
then what we've got is all we need
chorus:
you gotta have as reason
one reason to believe
a reason just to dream
but sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
one reason
you gotta have a reason
one reason to believe
a reason just to dream
but sometimes it takes blind eyes to see
one reason
gotta have a reason
gotta have a reason
one reason to believe"

i know he's going down...
darkness fades he's the prince of his city

you can see in their eyes life so paralyzed.
your just a pawn in a losin' game
you lose at life it ain't no game
hear their cries
the hardest part is the night
stay alive
the hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night...
all alone in a place where the lonely
they all have to walk through the rain
and they dance on the edge where you only
only pray that it has to end
that the night ain't no friend
hear their cries
the hardest part is the night
stay alive
the hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night...
these four walls they could tell you some stories
about lying and dying and fame
there's a price that you pay for the glory
about losing and choosing and pain.
hear their cries
the hardest part is the night
in the night, hear their cries, in the night
stay alive
in the night, stay alive, in the night"

don't want to live forever
just until the day i die
i see my daddy in his chair
he sits there night and day
the tv still looks good as new
daddy's old and gray
and it's scaring me to death
i don't want to go that way
i don't want to live forever
just want to know that i'm alive
don't want to live forever
just until the day i die
just because your heart's still beating
it don't mean that you're alive
don't want to live forever
nobody lives forever
gonna live while i'm alive
you can see the glass half empty
you can see the glass half full
but all i see are shattered dreams
around this neighborhood
my brother's girlfriend's pregnant
and today she's moving in
my friends all play the lottery
and swear one day they'll win
i'm seventeen, i'm thinking about dying
i'm seventeen, no way i'm dying
don't want to live forever
just want to know that i'm alive
don't want to live forever
just until the day i die
just because you're breathing
it don't mean that you're alive
don't want to live forever
nobody lives forever
i don't want to live forever
nobody lives forever
don't want to live forever
i don't want to live forever
nobody lives forever
i don't want to live forever
don't want to live forever
i don't want to live forever
nobody lives forever
i don't want to live forever
nobody lives forever
i don't want to live forever"

i tell myself that i'm one lucky guy

i got the girl i got the girl i got the girl 
she likes to wear her stripe with her plaids
won't brush her hair she don't like wearing shoes in december
but i don't care what she wears

so the angels that watch over her would give a break to me
holy mother of saint bubble gum and sister band aid knees

somebody is gonna take her from me
but the queen of hearts will always be
a five year old princess to me

"the last time that i saw her
was the night she said goodbye
she said that love's a stranger
and it's sure to pass you by, yes she did ...
as she packed up her belongings
baby wouldn't look me in the eye
but i could see a tear roll
off her face
as we both tried so hard
not to cry she said
i never wanted the stars
never shot for the moon
i like them right where they are
all i wanted was you
so baby just turn away
because i can't face the truth
all i'm trying to say
is all i wanted was you
i tried so hard to remember
when where how why love went away
i tried to drown myself in pity
but her memory kept calling your name, yes it did..
i bought you fancy cars and diamond rings
all the things that my money brings
and the servants to paint the sky blue
and i worked so hard seven days a week
and built a fortress for your heart to keep
if i could i'd wrap these words up for you
i never wanted the stars
never shot for the moon
i like them right where they are
all i wanted was you
so baby just turn away
because i can't face the truth
all i'm trying to say
is all i wanted was you
i may have built for you a dreamhouse
but never thought you were alone
i filled the party up with company
but never made our house a home
all i got is my guitar, these chords and the truth
all i got is my guitar.... but all i want is you"
"here comes the next big thing
there's a new gun in town
there'll be a faster one
before the sun goes down
they've come to kick the tires
they'd like to take a spin
see how it takes the turns
see if it breaks or bends
but i will drive you home
i want you to know that
i will drive you home
hell, it ain't nothing new
everything new gets old
maybe some glitter's gone
but we're still good as gold
when some driver comes
and tries to jump the start
thinks he can steal your love
hot wire your heart
but i will drive you home
i want you to know that
i will drive you home
let 'em rev their engines
let 'em spin their wheels
all they've got is shine
they're just chrome and steel
but i will drive you home
here comes that faster fast
here comes that higher high
as we walk on past
they just step aside
i will drive you home
i want you to know that
i will drive you home
let 'em rev their engines
let 'em spin their wheels
all they got is shine
they're just chrome and steel
when they raise the flag
and the smoke has cleared
when the rest are gone
i'll be standing here
i will drive you home
i want you to know that
i will drive you home
let 'em rev their engines
let 'em spin their wheels
all they got is shine
they're just chrome and steel
when they raise the flag
and the smoke has cleared
when the rest are gone
i'll be standing here

"what time is it baby, is it that time again
when snow will be falling, friends will be calling
you know it's time when, there'll be carolers singing silent night
i love when they sing, the feeling it brings
it's warm as a fire is bright
soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys
and reindeer are heading our way
yes, and santa will come down the chimney above
there's one thing i wanted to say
i wish every day could be like christmas
and if i could have one wish come true
i wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony
i wish every day could be like christmas, i do
i saw a child sit with old mr. clause,
looked him in the eye and he asked old santa what peace on earth was
now the old man grew cautious, on how he would say
that it's the greatest gift what you could give, every day
i wish every day could be like christmas
and if i could have one wish come true
i wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony
i wish every day could be like christmas, i do
now the mistle toe and the house aglow
all the world seems at ease tonight
and all that i ask when these precious moments pass
is why can't every day be so bright
i wish every day could be like christmas
and if i could have one wish come true
i wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony
i wish every day could be like christmas, i do
honest i do, yes i do now
very merry christmas"
"if you could see inside my heart
then you'd understand
i'd never mean to hurt you
baby i'm not that kind of man
i might not say i'm sorry
yeah, i might talk though sometimes
and i might forget the little things
or keep you hanging on the line
in a world that don't know romeo and juliet
boy meets girl
and promises we can't forget
we are cast from eden's gate with no regrets
into the fire we cry
chorus:
i'd die for you
i'd cry for you
i'd do anything
i'd lie for you
you know it's true
baby i'd die for you
i'd die for you
i'd cry for you
if it came right down to me and you
you know it's true, baby i'd die for you
i might not be a saviour
and i'll never be a king
i might not send you roses
or buy you diamond rings
but if i could see inside you
maybe i'd know just who we are
'cause our love is like a hunger
without it we would starve
in a world....

a life forsaken
a vacant storefront
i'm one more for sale sign

gonna shout out

"when it hurts just to talk, and it? s too dark to see
when my heart? s just a hole full of want, full of need
stuck at a stoplight, hands gripping the wheel
tears fill your eyes and you bleed just to feel
someone beside you, someone to cry to
into the echo, we shout our dreams
into the echo, we throw our hearts
into the echo, we send our love
into the echo, to the echo, into the echo
to hear it back
are you who you are
what? s under that mask
do you burn for the future or yearn for the past
did somebody send you, some broke fairy tale
now you wait by the water for a ship that has sailed
into the echo, we shout our dreams
into the echo, we throw our hearts
into the echo, we send our love
into the echo, to the echo, into the echo
just to hear it back
when it hurts just to talk, and it? s too dark to see

" letting you go
it ain't no fun lying down to sleep
and there ain't no secrets left for me to keep
i wish the stars up in the sky
would all just call in sick
and the clouds would take the moon out
on some one way trip
i drove all night down streets that wouldn't bend
but somehow they drove me
back here once again
to the place i lost at love,
and the place i lost my soul
i wish i'd just burn down this place
that we called home
it would all have been so easy
if you'd only made me cry
and told me how you're leaving me
to some organ grinder's lullaby
it's hard, so hard   it's tearing out my heart
it's hard letting you go
now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue
and the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to
well, me, these days
i just miss you   it's the nights that i go insane
unless you're coming back
for me, that's one thing i know that won't change
it's hard, so hard   it's tearing out my heart
it's hard letting you go
now sone tarot card shark said
i'll draw you a heart
and we'll find you somebody else new
but i've made my last trip
to those carnival lips
when i bet all that i had on you
it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, so hard
it's hard letting you go
it's hard, so hard   it's tearing out my heart
but it's hard letting you go
it's been four thousand hours, two hundred days
i curse every minute that you've been away
it's hard letting you go"

your favorite record that's all scratched and used

your high school picture, when you had wild hair
that stormy day on the beach that got us here

it's just me baby
if there's just one thing that you should keep
in your book of dreams
it's just me baby
just like a shadow 10 feet tall
standing right behind you should you fall
i'll be the one to hold you up to walk
when this wicked world makes us wont to crawl
and if your waves should ever break at sea
i'll be there waiting, i'm that sandy beach
i'm that same old dog, scratching those same fleas
i'll be by your side, you can count on me

it's just me baby
if there's just one thing that you should keep
in your book of dreams

in your book of dreams

do you remember me?
when i hit the streets i was 17
a little wild, a little green
i've been up and down and in between
after all these years and miles and memories
i'm still chasing dreams
but i ain't lookin' over my shoulder
i like the bed i'm sleeping in
it's just like me its broken in
it's not old, just older
like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
this skin i'm in its alright with me
it's not old, just older
it's good to see your face
you ain't no worse for wear
breathing that california air
when we took on the world
we were young and brave
we got secrets that we'll take to the grave
and were standing here shoulder to shoulder
i like the bed i'm sleeping in
it's just like me its broken in
it's not old, just older
like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
this skin i'm in its alright with me
it's not old, just older
i'm not old enough to sing the blues
but i wore the holes in the soles of these shoes
you can roll the dice
'till they call your bluff
but you can't win
until you're not afraid to lose, yeah
well, i look in the mirror
i don't hate what i see
there's a few more lines staring back at me
now the nights have grown a little bit colder
hey man, i gotta run
you take care
if you see coach t
tell him i've cut my hair
i kept my faith
i still believe i'm just

"hey mister can you help me
i'm a loner on the run
i'm just looking for tomorrow
and i ain't gonna hurt no one
i jumped headfirst into a bottle
i was looking for a friend
came up just short of nothing
i didn't find the truth i only found an end
so tell me who's gonna save me
or my father or my son
when the only justice a man can see
is the barrel... of a loaded gun
i been broke and i've been hungry
i think they're both my middle name
but i don't never ever never seem to get enough
still guess i can't complain
'cause what you get in life you take it
you've gotta hold on and make it last
they say good things come to those who wait
but it's life that goes so fast
and when there's just one rule you live by
each day you kiss the rising sun
when you live and die by the life we breathe
in the barrel of a loaded gun
guns talk to me in my sleep at night
and a gun somewhere is burning
with my name
winners are losers
and losers will have to face
all those yesterdays
and all of the dreams they blew away
so mister can you help me
or are you my gun
have the ghosts of justice
brought you here to me to taste
the barrel of a loaded gun
there's justice in the barrel
of a loaded gun"

there'd be no more blood
there'd be nothing but smiles
nothing but love

looking down, there was no net

me and my last cigarette
yeah we've been through this before
too late to cover up my tracks
damn the fool who begs for more
i'll take my past and paint it black
now this circus has left town
this clown has got to get his feet back on the ground
*
i'm learning how to fall
learning how to take a hit
had to walk before i crawled
it was winner take it all
now i'm learning how to fall
yeah, i got the hang of it
i was standing in the light
there were faces all around
i put my gloves up for a fight
one sucker punch and i was down

i was flying through the clouds
pucker up, it's time to kiss the ground

"ever since there was thunder
there's been shelter from the storm
a place to run for cover
till the rain clouds had moved on
now when i get that feeling
before the first drop hits the ground
i'm asking, ""who's gonna stop the rain from falling down? ""
wherever there's a soldier
who won't give up the fight
wherever there's a darkness
that's trying to find the light
wherever there is hurting
there is healing on the way
like sunshine breaking through a cloudy day
let it rain, let it rain
let the rain fall all around
who's gonna stop the rain from falling down?
maybe someday eyes won't judge you
by the bed you're sleeping in
the god you want to pray to
or the color of your skin
when priests and politicians
sell the truth and nothing more
that day we'll know what all of this was for
let it rain, let it rain
let the rain fall all around
who's gonna stop the rain from falling down?
these ain't pretty pictures that we're keeping in the cloud
outside a storm is raging
just take a look around
somewhere there's forgiveness
for the broken ones like me
who once stared down mighty mountains
and now sit beneath the trees
and somewhere there's a church bell
that's summoning the choir
somewhere there's a dreamer
who would walk 1, 000 miles
somewhere there's a dreamer
who would walk 1, 000 miles
let it rain, let it rain
let the rain fall all around
who's gonna stop the rain from falling?

"the weekend comes to this town
seven days too soon
for the ones who have to make up
what we break up for their rules
well i saw captain kidd on sunset
tell his boys they're in command
while chino danced a tango
with boomstick in his hand
he said: it's alright  if you have a good time
it's alright  if you want to cross that line
to break on through the other side
let it rock, let it go
you can stop a fire burning out of control
let it rock, let it go
with the night you're on on the loose
you got to let it rock
we go down to broadway
where everybody goes
to get on their rockin' horse
and blast that radio
well i saw roxie on the table
her girlfriend down below
they'll give it to the king of swing
before it's time to go
they said: it's alright ....
let it rock, let it go...."

"i was a little boy of nine years old
the whole world in my hands
trying to toss that ball across the yard
a game of catch with my old man
... always say ""i'm sorry""
every time he had to leave
and i was much too young to understand
when he would say to me
when you're young, you always think
the sun is gonna shine
there'll come a day you'll have to say hello to
goodbye
sit down son, come take my hand
look me in the eye
take these words, promise me
you live before you die
now i was barely seventeen, summer '79
already i was feeling like
i was running out of time
i had this girl, we fell in love
should i say that she had me
that fateful night we'd change our lives
and made a memory
when you're young, you always think
the sun is gonna shine
there'll come a day you'll have to say
hello to goodbye
she laided them down, she took my hand
looked me in the eye
and just before she kissed me she said
you gotta live before we die
live before you die
you learn to love, to live
you fight and you forgive
you learn what's wrong and right
live before you die
i made mistakes, i've called some breaks
but i've got no regrets
there's some things i don't remember
but one thing i don't forget
when you're young, you always think
the sun is gonna shine
one day you're gonna have to say hello to goodbye
shout it out, let someone somewhere know you're alive
take these words...

and your daddy don't approve

now there's a million questions
i could ask about our lives

to get me through the night
so, i say

just where we fit in
i call it love
they call it living in sin
is it you and me
or just this world we live in
i say we're living on love
they say we're living in sin
is right for both our parents
who fight it out most night
they pray for god's forgiveness
when they both turn out the lights
or wear that ring of diamonds
when your heart is made of stone
you can talk but still say nothing
you stay together but alone
or is it right to hold you
and kiss your lips goodnight
they say the promise is forever
if you sign it on the dotted line
baby, can you tell me
just where we fit in
i call it love
they call it living in sin
is it you and me

all tears into wine

i wrote each word you gave the
toast
but we were fire and gasoline
i ain't living with the ghost
i set my sails over wheat fields
rode waves of amber let a new sun
shine on my face
i dropped the sword put down my shield
i left your scars for the stars
guiding my way
i traded hurting for healing
i must admit that i was reeling
now i'm feeling just fine
traded nightmares for dreaming
go tell your shadows
that i got out alive
i ain't living with the ghost
no future living in the past
i've seen what hate has done to hope
i found the tree i cut the rope
tomorrow wasn't built to last
i ain't living with the ghost
how can i scream i'm scared to breathe
i wrote each word you gave the
toast
but we were fire and gasoline
i ain't living with the ghost
last night i had this dream
i saw a man wash his feet
in the church holy water
he worked up to his knees
from his arms to his neck
said i'm over my head
he was crying trying to get some relief
lord, i'm just trying to get some relief
i had this dream
that man was me
i ain't living with the ghost
no future living in the past
i've seen what hate has done to hope
i found the tree i cut the rope
tomorrow wasn't built to last
i ain't living with the ghost
how can i scream i'm scared to breathe

happy is one thing it's not.
i was jaded, suffocated, it got too hard to breath
but i never got as high as i needed to be

take me, touch me, hold me like you mean it
make me come alive
hurt me, heal me, come and make me feel it
rescue me tonight
love me back to life
these days i'd trade sight for feeling
there are days my feeling's gone
can't figure out whose life i'm living
i don't know right from wrong
when i lost my faith
you found it and gave it back to me
there's a new light on your halo; it took blind eyes to see
that i need you
more than yesterday
yeah, i need you
chorus:
take me, touch me, hold me like you mean it
make me come alive
hurt me, heal me, come and make me feel it
rescue me tonight
love me back to life
take me, touch me, hold me like you mean it
make me come alive
hurt me, heal me, come and make me feel it
rescue me
take me, touch me, hold me like you mean it
make me come alive
hurt me, heal me, come and make me feel it
rescue me tonight
love me back to life
love me back to life
love me back to life
love me back to life"
"i don't give a damn how it's supposed to be
that might work for you, it don't work for me
you write your truth and i'll write mine
one man's ceiling's another man's sky high
flying like an aeroplane
crying like the lonely whistle of a long black train
dance in the pouring rain
spit in the eye of a hurricane
who said life's got to be so cruel
love's the only rule
it's written in the stars where i fit in
it's going to hurt sometimes, you got to lose to win
you got your sins and i got mine
sell your secrets, kiss them all goodbye
flying like an aeroplane
alive like a lonely note from john coltrane
run like it's a getaway
say those things that you shouldn't say
think about it, wouldn't it be cool?
love's the only rule
might be a wrecking ball
or just a wake up call
don't matter where the pieces fall
woohoo
i'm gonna fly like an aeroplane
cry like the whistle of a long black train
dance in the pouring rain
i'm alive like a lonely note from john coltrane
run like its a getaway
say those things that you shouldn't say
where love, love's the only rule
yes love, love's the only rule"
"word just came from upstate joe
lower the flag again
this time it's dayton, southwest ohio
last night el paso, texas counted 22 dead
soon the brass will offer up their thoughts and prayers
soon there'll be protests in the street
and the media from out of town
will chew it up and spit it out
then move on to the next one
before we even grieve
yeah, then move on to the next one
before we even grieve
some say we start to die on the day that we're born
but no one wants to live life on their knees
maybe we start to die on the day that we're born
but we deserve to live life in between
a husband kissed the cross that bears his margie's name
and promises he'll see her once again
won't see her childen grow
won't see their love grow old
last night their dream became a nightmare
and their nightmare has no end
last night their dream became a nightmare
and their nightmare has no end
some say we start to die on the day that we're born
but no one wants to live life on their knees
maybe we start to die on the day that we're born
but we deserve to live life in between
these days it's hard to sleep
when i lay my head down
what if it was your loved one
laying on the ground
i'm left to think about
what if, what now?
dear god i wanna pray
but tonight i have my doubts
when i think about those families now
if there's something we can talk about
let's talk about it
if there's something we can figure out, let's figure it out
if there's something we can talk about
let's talk about it

she says every girl in the past is just a waste of time

she don't believe in miracles and make believe
if you were blind you still could see
that she believes in me, ohhhh
feels like i found a pocket full of gold
i'm lucky baby
so lucky baby
lucky to be with you today
lucky to be the one to say ""i'm lucky baby""
so lucky baby
whenever i see your smiling face
lucky to be the one to be lucky
now all of heaven's angels have to wear their wings
she likes cheap sunglasses and diamond rings
you know, ohhh
she brings sunshine to a cloudy day

"i wish i could fix your broken
wish i could fill your empty
right that wrong, make it fair
i wish i could feed your hunger
wish i could steal your heart
breach the sky with your prayer

and they don't hold a master plan
so i can't, but love can
love can, love can, love can
love can when words can't speak
heal where hands can't reach
hold what no one can touch
love can ease your burden
i wish i could quench your thirst
take that hurt from your eyes
i wish i could be the answer
i wish i could break the chain
be the rest for your tired

"and i would give up tomorrow
and die for one yesterday
i'd lie, beg, steal and borrow
to hear you whisper my name
tonight there ain't no miracles
washing up on this beach
the angels left here long ago
but i still believe that
maybe someday
i will hold your hand
and maybe someway
we'll trace our footsteps in the sand
and just walk away… baby someday
now i don't know how a heart beats
but i sure know how one breaks
remember how i used to hold you
to share every breath that you'd take
how can i forget
your every tear that i cry
i know you're coming back
you never kissed me goodbye
maybe someday
i will hold your hand
and maybe someway
we'll trace our footsteps in the sand
and just walk away…
they say that nothing lasts forever
but we know our two hearts beat together
and though you're far away
every night i pray
maybe someday… someday…
maybe someday
i will understand
baby someway
we'll trace these footsteps in the sand
just walk away… maybe someday
maybe someday
maybe someday
maybe someway"
"seems like years since i've been home
living this dream on the endless roads
faces in the crowd, they stare at me
yours is the only one i wanted to see
my heart cries out for sympathy
but i need to hold you next to me
and it won't be long, baby
maybe tomorrow
these hotel rooms they're all the same
only the number on the door will be changed
lord i gotta do me one more show
then it's into the bus and off we go
should have talked to you
well i don't have to try
when i find the music in your eyes
and i'm telling myself that we'll take that ride, baby
maybe tomorrow
i should?ve talked to you
well i don't got to try
where i can find the music in your eyes
we're all blind, two lovers, into the night

"there's a town that i call home
where all the streets are paved with soul
down on beale there's a honky tonk bar
so hear the wail of a blues guitar
have a beer and drop a dime in the blind man's jar
the blues sing softly in the air like a sunday morning
prayer
just one more drink and you'll see god everywhere
like a sad old melody that cheers you up, it sets you
free
that's how memphis lives in me
there comes a time when muddy waters run rough
there comes a point when a man has had enough
like a friend that always stands by me
memphis knows me
never showed me
how did life just had to be
i couldn't even try to run away, say goodbye
here i was born and here is where i'll die
i'm just a man from tennessee
i can't be what i can't be
all i know is memphis lives in me
i said i'm just a man from tennessee
can't be what i can't be
all i know is memphis lives
all i know is memphis gives
all i know is memphis lives in me"
"the kids 'round here look just like sticks
they trade old licks with a beat up six
i just smile and catch the groove
gothic girls all dress in black
serious as heart attacks
it takes a little bit of getting used to
the old man with the whiskey stains
lost the night forgot his name
his poor wife will sleep alone again
and it ain't hard to understand
why she's holding on to her own hand
refrão:
it's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
no one's asking me for favors
no one's looking for a savior
they're too busy saving me
i've seen a lone,sloane ranger drive
seems her chauffeur took a dive
and sold her secrets to the sun
and later in a magazine
i finally figured what it means
to be a saint, not a queen
two lustful lovers catch a spark
and chase their shadows in the dark
someone's getting off tonight
of a big red bus that's packed so tight
it disappears in a trail of light
somewhere someone's dreaming baby it's all right...
it's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
no one's asking me for favors
no one's looking for a savoir
they're too busy saving me
midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
no one's pinned dreams on me
no one's asking me to bleed
i'm the man i want to be
when chelsea girls sing...
it's morning when i go to sleep
in the distant dawn a church bell rings
another day is coming on
a baby's born, an old man dies
somewhere young lovers kiss good bye
i leave my soul and just move on
and wish that i was there to sing this song
refrão
it's midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea
no one's pinned dreams on me
no one's asking me to bleed
i'm the man i want to be
the man i want to be,the man i want to be
midnight in chelsea"

so we wave goodbye to miss fourth of july
the queen of the roses has left us with nothing but
thorns
don't say we never tried, miss fourth of july
the stars that we reached for left us with nothing but
dawn
i used to laugh but i've learned to cry
for i ain't too proud to let you see tears fall from
these eyes
for all of my hopes, my heartaches and fears
for a night i just watched and you walked out of here
chorus:
i just waved goodbye to miss fourth of july
the queen of the roses has left us with nothing but
thorns
don't say we never tried, miss fourth of july
the crown that we reached for left us with nothing
but your thorns left me wounded not unlike the truth
when innocence sang his last song
he'd tell me that it's all gone
just look me in the eyes and say it meant nothing at
all
  solo  
i used to live, now i've learned to die
and i used to dream? i used to dream?
chorus:
so now we wave goodbye to miss fourth of july
the queen of the roses has left us with nothing but
thorns
don't say we've never tried, miss fourth of july
the stars that we reached for, they've left us with
nothing but dawn
oh, yeah?
nothing but a heavy hit of heartbreak
a handful of blues.."

it's got a hundred different stations
they all look the same to me

someday you'll call me mr. big time too
in the big reclining chair
with a cold six pack of beer
you've got a front row seat
lean back and put up you're feet
man, the future is looking bright from here
i'm getting ready for the big time
someday i'm going to be in big time news
i can taste it, i'll be prime time

"i've always wanted what i couldn't have
i hope and dream that maybe someday
that i'd find out what love was all about
i sure grew up tonight the hard way
now the candy store's closed, the movie's sold out
high plains drifter isn't what it's all about
and now we're parting ways, i won't say a word
let our broken hearts cry in their graves
where they'll never be heard
it's more than we bargained for
our love is the price we've paid
and just like a fading dream....
it's slippin' away
last night i saw you out with my best friend
when i'm with you i see him in your eyes
i want to hold you but i don't understand
there's something there that's so hard to disguise
now tears run down your face, as you walk through the night
those cold empty streets leave you wondering what's right
as you walk away with your broken heart
don't you try to deny that true love had torn you apart
more than we bargained for
our love is the price we've paid
and just like a fading dream....
it's slippin' away
it's more than we bargained for
it's more than we bargained for
more than we bargained for
our love is the price weve paid
and just like a fading dream....
it's slippin' away
more than we bargained for
our love is the price weve paid

"misery likes company, i like the way that sounds
i've been trying to find the meaning, so i can write it down
staring out the window, it's such a long way down
i'd like to jump, but i'm afraid to hit the ground
i can't write a love song the way i feel today
i can't sing no song of hope, i got nothing to say
life is feeling kind of strange, since you went away
i sing this song to wherever you are,
as my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
i'm tired of watching tv, it makes me want to scream
outside the world is burning, man it's so hard to believe
each day you know you're dying from the cradle to the grave
i get so numb sometimes, that i can't feel the pain
i can't write a love song the way i feel today
i can't sing no song of hope, i got nothing to say
life is feeling kind of strange, since you went away
i sing this song to wherever you are,
as my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
staring at the paper, i don't know what to write
i'll have my last cigarette well, turn out the lights
maybe tomorrow i'll feel a different way
but here is my delusion, i don't know what to say
i can't write a love song the way i feel today
i can't sing no song of hope, i got nothing to say
and i can't fight the feelings, that are burning in my veins
i send this song to wherever you are,
as my guitar lies bleeding
i can't write a love song the way i feel today
i can't sing no song of hope, there's no one left to save
and i can't fight the feelings, buried in my brains
i send this song to wherever you are,

as my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
as my guitar lies bleeding in my arms"

gates of hell

those things change
'cause love is just another word
for trust

never say die
never say no

through the pouring rain

who comes marching home again

on the gravestone where i'll lie
tell them it's just my bones
that died there
so save the tears they'll cry
my spirit is still riding somewhere
somewhere in this night

no regrets for wars i've won
no regrets for fires i've started
no regrets for faith departed

i'm not sure where to begin
i won't name names or where i've been

just stay inside until i leave

always running
never had both feet
on the floor
i've been running
always running
now i ain't running any more

never had both feet
on the floor
i've been running
always running
now i ain't running any more
yeah, there were roses i have loved
who've given or have given up
i pushed your patience and my luck
it wasn't love i didn't trust
it wasn't you, or me, or us
you've shouldered ifs, and ands, and buts

doesn't matter, baby, what i say
it all amounts to nothing anyway
when push comes to shove, it's never enough
it always comes down to something
how could i live? why would i try?
i've been learning to live without you but that's a lot
no giving in or saying goodbye
seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing
i thought i saw you reach out, thought i saw you try
waiting here for something, nothing is all i find
kneeling at your altar, standing on the shore
i'm waiting out, now listen, i'm outside your door

it always comes down to something
how could i live? why would i try?
i've been learning to live without you but that's a lot

we'll divide up all the lies
keep all the pictures in their frames
just cut me out, yeah, i'll be fine
sell the neighbors all my feelings
go on give away my pride
it's hard to laugh and cry, live and die every night
keep your rolodex of friends
and all the remnants can be mind
i guess there'll be no happy endings
when “once upon” is doing time
there's a different kind of meaning now
to livin' on a prayer
some don't seem to notice
and the rest don't seem to care
i tell myself i but i'm feeling the pain can't walk away
i'm hanging on the ropes of hope
it's getting hard to cope you know
when you're the needle running through my veins
i've changed my name to novocaine
you put my favorite belongings in a box in the garage
you burned my favorite sweats from high school
tried to sell my muscle car you're mother's gonna visit for a couple months this year
they say you do the crime, you do the time
it's all so clear
i tell my self i but i'm feeling the paint can't walk away
i'm hanging on the ropes of hope
it's getting hard to cope you know
when you're the needle that's running through my veins
i've changed my name to novacaine novacaine

it's a sleepless, self help century
i'm up to here with dr. phil and the modern man in me…"
"it's been a long time, baby, how've you been,
but it sure feels good to see you again, my friend.
i still remember just like yesterdays
though the miles and the smiles roll on, they won't fade away
and it hurts just like hell to let go, but i know
kings will be kings with crowns to defend
but i'm just one man and i can't pretend
a heart's just a heart and songs have to end
dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends
now and forever, now and forever
i still remember when you didn't know my name.
we were lost on the road but you made it my home just the same,
god i wanna say that you gotta hold on when we go our separate ways
but when your radio's on, you're hearing this song
i hope that you say nothing's changed
kings will be kings with crowns to defend
but i'm just one man and i can't pretend
a heart's just a heart and songs have to end
dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends
now and forever, now and forever
kings will be kings with crowns to defend
but i'm just one man and i can't pretend
a heart's just a heart and songs have to end
now dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends
now and forever, now and forever."
"you look like shit so dear my brother
i missed you too, yeah you dumb stupid mother
jeep, welcome home sign, a bottle of red
at least you got freedom in an open out there
free cheers till the best of the rest we got left
if you could dream anything, what would that be?
if you could dream back, would you share it with me?
we carry our choices, we hide our regrets
we know there's a price, we'll both pay our debts
but maybe they ain't seen the last of us yet
'cause old habits die hard
old habits die hard
it might be painful to smile
but it covers the scars
and old habits die hard
there's a face in the mirror, but it don't look like me
yesterday's gone, a rain drop in the sea
i have your back for each day that's gone by
and i'll still have it till the day that i die
yeah, i'll still have it till the day that i die
old habits die hard
old habits die hard
it might be painful to smile
but it covers the scars
and old habits die hard
some day you'll be missed by those you leave behind
and i hope you touched other lives like you've touched mine
old habits die hard
old habits die hard
it might be painful to smile
but it covers the scars
appearances change but don't change who we are
and old habits die hard."
"i've seen my heart of darkness
let's just say i crossed over that line
held hands with the hopeless
in too deep on that ride went around one more time
when you're standing on the edge you don't look down
til you're ready and willing to fly
now i'm one step closer
with my arms open wide here
i'm one step closer
and i'm willing to try this time
i hitched a ride with forgiveness
in that river of emotion i went down a third time
i spent the night with the living
took a chance looked inside didn't know who i'd find
standing on the corner of that lone goodbye
all alone, it's there i made up my mind
yeah i'm one step closer
with my arms open wide here
i'm one step closer
and i'm willing to try
i'm sick of giving up
ooh, with a little luck
i'm gonna get out of here
when you're standing on the edge don't look down
til you're ready and willing to fly
i'm one step closer
with my arms open wide here
i'm one step closer
and i'm willing to try this time"
"it's a hot night, the natives are restless
we're sweating by the light of the moon
there's a voodoo mojo brewing at the gogo

so i'm passing by, she gives me the eye
so i stop to give her a light

just might be i found religion

everyday

flame?

never came
i can't bend the hands of time so i think myself to
sleep

tell me where you want to go
will you be what you want to be?
are you longing for my touch?

if only in my dreams
lord, i'd sacrifice my eyes; there's nothing else i'd
rather see
and you can have my heart   it's of little use to me
and if you want my soul i'd throw it in for free
it's all i'm worth that's left since my angel got her
wings
now i'm down and on my knees; it's of little use to
pray
unless you give her back but there's no deals cut
these days
they're only in my dreams

tell me where you want to go
tell me what you long to be
are you longing for my touch?

if only in my dreams
now i curse the daytime
when i'm alone at nighttime
'cause i swore the sun shined just for you
and i know you anywhere
there ain't no pain, there ain't no tears
and if i have my way from the moment i get there?
chorus:
take me where you wanna go
we'll be who you wanna be
all i needed was your touch
all i want is you and me

sunlight through the curtains
diamonds in the trees

drawn from this blank page
every line from my hand
takes me back to what i can't erase
no matter how i try
no matter what i do
i'm still painting pictures of you
i could almost smell your perfume
in each brush stroke of the flowers
i left you tea from china
waiting in your sacred tower
something so familiar
drawn from this blank page
every line from my hand
takes me back to what i can't erase
no matter how i try
no matter what i do
i'm still painting pictures of you.
if i should go crazy
if i would go blind
i'd still fill the canvas
from the pictures in my mind
if that's the only way to make you mine
it was something so familiar
drawn from this blank page
every line from my hand
takes me back to what i can't erase
no matter how i try
no matter what i do

i'm always painting pictures
still painting pictures of you"

lying in this bed alone

no regrets, i took the step and i'm still falling
saturday nights gave me sunday mornings, yeah

making time without feet in the sand
making up words to our favourite songs
laughing loud with those drinks in our hands

she pulled him tight to get a bit closer
and as the world just disappeared
you whispered in my ear

why too many soul's are feeling so alone.
you've got to hold on if it's all you can do.
save a prayer for me, i'll save a prayer for you.
i'll save a prayer for you, i'll save a prayer for you,
i'll save a prayer....
for you, for you, for you."
"i never went to college
i don't have a degree
let's say i went to night school
i learned all i know on the streets
i wasn't born a rich man
i ain't got no pedigree
the sweat on this old collar
that's my ph. d.
it comes down to this
i wouldn't exist
without you it ain't worth the grind
i'd fight for one kiss
on a moon night like this
you make me feel i could fly, like
i can save the world
since the night your love saved me
maybe i can't save the world
but as long as you believe
maybe i can save the world
i got to confess
sometimes i'm a mess
and sometimes i step out of line
like this old tattoo
i ain't shiny or new
with you by my side nothing matters
i can save the world
since the night your love saved me
maybe i can't save the world
but as long as you believe
maybe i can save the world
they can say it's blind love
but it's a fool who don't believe
that i'd fly all the way to the moon
just to walk you down your street
i could save the world
since the night your love saved me
maybe i can't save the world
but as long as you believe
our love is even stronger
than god hoped it could be
baby, all it takes is
just a little faith in me
to feel like
i can save the world
i can save the world"
"i just can't believe
it was all a lie
no man in the moon
just a big light in the sky
i hear disneyland
might lose mickey mouse
in some giant hostile corporate skake up
tell me it's a nightmare
please wake me up 
i found a book of matches
from some place we've never been
how come you hang the phone up
the minute i walk in
last night i had this dream
that i was losing you
i woke up in a cold sweat shaking
rescue me my heart is breaking
say it isn't so say it isn't so tell me it's a lie say everything's alright say it isn't so
superman don't fly
they did it all with strings
elvis presley died
the deep fried the king
like some tacky cheesy bathing beauty
dancing on the beach in a bad b movie
say it isn't so say it isn't so tell me it's a lie say everything's alright 
say it isn't so say it isn't so get me through the night make everything alright "
"another friday night i'm somewhere
a little drunk and worn out from the show
it's a hallway to a hotel room
the truck's already rolling down the road
i find the lights, take off my coat
i see her there just lying on the bed
she's seen me through my yesterdays
god knows tonight i'm needing her again
she's the place i go
when there's nowhere left to run to
she's the one i hold
when there's no one to hold on to
she's been with me late at night
when i was drowning in the dark
she heard my every word
when i was pouring out my heart
so i thank my lucky stars
for every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar
she's given me her best
when i am at my worst
when i can't find the pieces
fingers scratching in the dirt
she offers no forgiveness
''cause she likes to make it hurt
she's the place i go
when there's nowhere left to run to
she's the one i hold
when there's no one to hold on to
she's been with me late at night
when i was drowning in the dark
she heard my every word
when i was pouring out my heart
so i thank my lucky stars
for every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar
morning like a freight train
last night still ringing in my head
before today becomes tomorrow
tonight i know i'll do it all again
she's the place i go
when there's nowhere left to run to
she's the one i hold
when there's no one to hold on to
she's been with me late at night
when i was drowning in the dark
she heard my every word
when i was pouring out my heart
so i thank my lucky stars
for every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar
and so i thank my lucky stars
for every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar"
"long slow drive down an old dirt road
you've got your hand out the window, listening to the radio
that's where i wanna be...
on an old park bench in the middle of december
cold hard rain fallin', can't find no cover
that would be alright with me...
hard days, good times, blue skies, dark nights
baby, i want you to take me ... wherever you're going to
maybe say that you'll save me ... a seat next to you
in the corner booth of a downtown bar, with your head on my shoulder
smokin' on a cheap cigar...that would be alright with me
in the back row of a movie or a cross town train
i wanna hear your voice whispering my name...that's where i wanna be
hard days, good times, blue skies, dark nights
baby, say that you'll take me ... wherever you're going to
maybe say that you'll save me ... a seat next to you
life is like a ferris wheel, spinnin' around
when you get to the top it's hard to look down
just hang on ... we'll make it through
save me ... a seat next to you
when you get to the gates and the angels sing
go to that place where the church bells ring
you know i'll come runnin' ... runnin' to find you
baby, say that you'll take me ... wherever you're going to
maybe i want you to save me ... a seat next to you
a seat next to you
a seat ... next to you"

oh i live, love to loose control
it makes me crazy i want to let you know.
oh, no, i don't want to fall

all night long in my secret dreams
you tell me i'm the one
when i'm next to you next to you.
all i want in my secret dreams
is you here with me.
i got to get to you, get to you, get to you.
there's a thrill, in the chase
we won't lose when we meet face to lace.
love, games a means without and end.
i go down but i'll be back again
thru' the night with no retreat
when your with me in my sleep.

i dream of crossing that line
and holding her so tender
dreaming it could come true
so many things i would do
if only you'd give me a chance

your song on the wind

there ain't no sight nor sound
that makes my world go round
i come alive with you by my side
i can't get close enough
whenever i feel your touch
nothing lights up my sky
like watching you shine
watching you shine
a box for your dreams
a book for your heart
take the stick and stone
and we'll make a spark
in your eyes i can see
a thousand forevers
we started this fire
we're building together
tomorrow seems so far from here
take my hand, i'll take you there
there ain't no sight nor sound
that makes my world go round

after all i've done for you you're lying

you're gonna take a fall
i gave you everything
now here's the curtain call
shot through the heart as i lay there alone
in the dark through the heart
it's all part of this game that we call love
now you've come back here to say you're sorry
but i don't know who you're talking to
it could be the man i used to be, girl
but i've grown up and now i'm over you
standing there just a live wire
with nowhere left to turn
you were gonna set the world on fire
when will you ever learn?
didn't somebody somewhere say
you're gonna take a fall
i gave you everything

we got a lot, we don't more

we're rolling, baby
tell me when you go
rolling, ready
tell me where to go
i don't wanna watch the tv
wash the dishes now or pay the bills
don't wanna eat, don't need to sleep
the only real meal that gives me a thrill
don't need no candles, you're the spark
don't need no matches, just a fire in the dark

when it's down to you and i
when the sun appears
and there's nothing left but goodbyes
we'll just turn and walk away
how could we let it end like this
just turn and walk away
should we seal it with a kiss
it's too late
now you're out and on the run
it's too late
held up in love without a gun
silent night
we hold up our candle light
silent night
the night our love died, no words to say
and we're both too tired to fight
just hold me close and don't let go...
it was all so simple when
you were to be queen and i'd be your king.
i guess those dreams got lost
cause baby you're still you and i'm still me.
now letting go
it's always the hardest part to fight
when we both know
we're just two more victims of the night
it's too late
too late to wonder why
much too late
to save a love that's died.
silent night
we hold up our candle light
silent night
the night our love died, no words to say
now we're both too tired to fight
just hold me close and don't let go
just hold me close and don't let me go
after the smoke cleared
it was down to you and i
when the sun appeared
there was nothing left but goodbyes...

"you can read it in the papers
in some places it comes in thirty two flavors

your favorite if you could

from the president down to long tall sally
can't live with it but you'll die without it
yes you would
senorita's in the kitchen
she's a fistful of dynamite
you call 911 but you can't stop the fun tonight, it's alright
you can't start a fire without a spark
but there's something that i guarantee
you can't hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease
where you look you can find it
try to run but you're always behind it
so you play hide and seek like a blind kid
till you're caught, yeah you're caught
so you'll say that you had some
but they took it and held it for ransom
were they tall, dark, skinny or handsome
you won't talk
so you telephone your doctor
just to see what pill to take
you know there's no prescription
gonna wipe this one away
you can't start a fire without a spark
but there's something that i guarantee
you can't hide when infection starts
because love is a social disease
so full of high grade octane
she could run the bullet train on 38 double d's
now you know for sure, you know the cure
to make a blind man see"

my name is billy jean,
my love is bought and sold
i'm only sixteen, i feel a hundred years old
my foster daddy went and took my innocence away

i'm getting paid

and what's left of my pride
i'm feeling like a monday
but i wish i were a saturday night
i can't say my name, my life is on the line
they say that i'm to blame, that
i'm guilty of a crime
i wish that i could be in another time and place
with someone else's soul and someone else's face
this world ain't so cut and dry but i can't 'why?'
wrong or right i ain't here to justify
what i gotta do to survive

stand and fight, you just might win
when the ride gets rough

someday just might be tonight
you're the kind that goes swimming with a raincoat on
who's to say if you are right or wrong
let me know when you figured it out
just don't go drowning in a shadow of doubt
don't let the bastards make up your mind
chorus:
don't give up, don't give in
stand and fight, you just might win
when the ride gets rough

someday just might be tonight
you may never find a treasure that's been washed up on the beach
heaven won't be waiting for you walking down these city streets
remember mama's band aids on your scabby knees
they had to bleed for little victories

don't give up, don't give in
stand and fight, you just might win

tonight i'll suck my gut in
i'll face the night and i'll pretend
i got something to believe in
and i had lost touch with reason
i watched life criticize the truth
been waiting for a miracle
i know you have too
though i know i won't win
i'll take this one on the chin
we'll raise a toast and i'll pretend
i got something to believe in
if i don't believe in jesus, how can i believe the pope
if i don't believe in heroin, how can i believe the dope
if there's nothing but survival, how can i believe
in sin

you think you see me 'cause you've seen every line of my face
you want to want me just because i say that i want you

you need somebody, somebody to hold on to
but this ain't the movies and we ain't the heroes
staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
the streetlights buzz as the cars roll by
and the moon don't give a damn
my boots just keep on walkin', but my heart don't understand
why i'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
i say i want you, but when we woke up one of us was crying
you rolled over and all you said was 'man i think i'm dying'
our song is over, the band of gold has been feeling like a nose
you place your bets, 'cause no one thinks they'll lose
staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
the streetlights buzz as the cars roll by
and the moon don't give a damn
my boots just keep on walkin', but my heart don't understand
why i'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand

the night is fading, like my old tattoo
a heart and a dagger, that says 'forever'
staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand
the streetlights buzz as the cars roll by
and the moon don't give a damn
i'm gettin' tired of talking, and i don't understand
why i'm staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand"

it's been a long time, long time since i've seen your face.
but on and on i could not replace,
the fire that burns for you. yeah.
so here's to the good times, here to the bad,
here's to the memories that we all had.

do you remember, remember the odds we were given,
we had nothing and we thought that was living,
lord and it's been such a long, long road.
long, long road.
here's to our old friends who helped us get by,
here's to the dreamers, may their dreams never die,
if we believe we can keep all the good times alive.
tonight, we'll be starting all over again,
and it feels like the first time i.....
no i'll never feel this way again.
whoa oh, tonight, we'll be starting all over again,
and it feels like the first time i.....

"every singer's always singing about someone else
another bleeding heart, another brand new start
but this time i'm singing all about myself
i made it be so lonely
even my piano wants to cry
these arms weren't there to hold you
and when i was home i was miles away
now you've got every right to go girl but i'm standing here
i'm begging you
stay just a little longer
you've always been the one who's stronger
i can't let you go
i'm begging you stay
stay because i need you
with every breath i breathe you
i can't let you walk away
there are things i didn't ever say or do
like i would die without you
didn't mean i didn't want to
but every song i ever sang i sang for you
and every night away from you
knowing you'd be home's what got me through
tore up all the pictures of our wasted yesterdays
i'm fighting for tomorrow, standing here
i'm begging you
stay just a little longer
you've always been the one who's stronger
i can't let you go
i'm begging you stay
stay because i need you
with every breath i breathe you
i can't let you walk away
stay, i know i've done you wrong
it'd be easy to move on
i'm telling you, i'm begging you, i'm pleading, i'm screaming
stay just a little longer
you've always been the one who's stronger
i can't let you go
i'm begging you stay
stay because i need you
with every breath i breathe you
i can't let you walk away

well you know it's more that just a ride

you got to make 'em all believe it

aim from the heart
some will love and some will curse you, baby
and you can go to war
but only if you have to
it's only if you have to
so you want to be the big time
some people have to drag you down
there's no living in the backseat
if you're gonna drive through town
and when you pray for independence
boy, you better stand your ground
you got to give it all you got now
or you might get shot down
fight hard until the battle is won
stick to your guns
ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
you can pull the trigger
but only if you have to
aim from the heart
some will love and some will curse you, baby
and you can go to war
but only if you have to
but only if you have to

i got the scars to prove it
fight hard and the battle is yours
stick to your guns

some will love and some will curse you, baby
and you can go to war

"fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
they've been writing our story before there was one
from the day you arrive, till you walk, till you run
there is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love
they can offer advice that you don't wanna hear
words that cut like a knife and still ring in your ear
you think of them ignorant, they think of you arrogant
if you need evidence, who gave you confidence?
a snap of the finger and you're not a child
but you're still holding on as you walk down the aisle
when they give you away to hear someone else say
that someone will love you till their dying day
fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
they've been writing our story before there was one
from the day you arrive till you walk, till you run
there is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love
and that's the story of love
you can choose to remember or choose to forget
if they took you to school or they tucked you in bed
you can say it don't matter, you won't do the same
you'd think no one noticed when you looked away
fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
they've been writing our story before there was one
from the day you arrive till you walk, till you run
there is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love
now they're getting older and you ain't so young
so you take care of them like your daughters and sons
you can ask for forgiveness, they could ask for the same
forget all the anguish, the heartache, the pain
wherever you go or wherever you've been
it's them that is with you and that's you that's with them
fathers and daughters and mothers and sons
as one story ends another's begun
oh, fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
they've been writing our story before there was one
from the day you arrive till you walk, till you run
there is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love
from hello to goodbye that's the story of love
that's the story of love"
"he says he's your friend, but you don't see him
he says that he's so damn busy, but he don't do nothing at all
you get him on the phone, he was just gonna call you
says he's been thinking about old times, and looking at your picture on the wall
he's stringin' you the same old lines, that he puts everyone through
they're only lies, intentions just won't do
for a time he feels no wrong, 'till he finds out we've caught on
he's stringin' a line, he's stringin' a line
so you try to forget, but that ain't so easy
'cause if you've got one small doubt, there was never anything there
you dangle on a line, a captive fool
well you know he'll try again, and it will just be the same as last time
he's stringin' you the same old lines, that he puts everyone through
they're only lies, intentions just won't do
for a time he feels no wrong, 'till he finds we've all caught on

fear sits in misery
nursing another black eye
on the new jersey turnpike
i'm counting the headlights
as cars just like days pass me by
i am the fighter
though not a boxer by trade
i am the fighter
few will remember my name
i am the fighter
though not a boxer by trade
i am the fighter
a fighter is born but not made
i should write down these words before i lose them
or write you a song just to use them"
"silver bullet in the wild blue
crack in the walls i'm coming through
think you can stop me, well
take a look in these eyes
you can't cage what you can't tame
there ain't no rules, this ain't a game
there's no way to stop the fire inside
you can escape a pouring rain
you can run for shelter in a hurricane
change your face, lose your name
lie about things you can't explain
but there's one thing that you cannot deny
the fire inside
the fire inside
you can run from what's in your blood and
you can't hide
from the fire inside
the fire inside
tonight i'll run i need no sleep
when it feels this good you're in too deep
in blood i'm gonna write my name, cover my tracks
i feel no shame
just let 'em try and stop
the fire inside
the fire inside, the fire inside
you can run from what's in your blood and
you can't hide
the fire inside, the fire inside
it's the only way you know you're still alive
the fire inside, the fire inside
there's no place for me in heaven
tonight i just might die
they'll be no one to hold my hand
for me no one will cry
there'll be no forgiveness but i'll never deny
the fire inside, the fire inside
you can't run from what's in your blood and you can't hide
the fire inside, the fire inside
it's the only way to know you're still alive
the fire inside, the fire inside
the fire inside, the fire inside
it's the fire inside, the fire inside"
"in the heat of the street of the city
a young boy hides the pain
he walks so tall, trying to hang on
but he knows he's going down again
i know he's going down...
darkness fades he's the prince of his city
in a place where they all know your name
you can see in their eyes life so paralyzed.
your just a pawn in a losin' game
you lose at life it ain't no game
hear their cries the hardest part is the night
stay alive the hardest part is the night,
all alone in a place where the lonely
they all have to walk through the rain
and they dance on the edge where you only
only pray that it has to end
that the night ain't no fame
 hear their cries the hardest part is the night
stay alive the hardest part is the night,
...)
solo
these four walls they could tell you some stories
about lying and dying and fame
there's a price that you pay for the glory
about losing and choosing and pain.
hear their cries the hardest part is the night
stay alive the hardest part is the night,
hear their cries the hardest part is the night
stay alive "
"these days, its hard to have a heart
it doesn't matter where you come from, or who you think you are
these days, it's hard just fitting in
why does someone have to lose, for someone else to win
we're all looking for forgiveness, and someone we can trust
you can wrap your arms around the world
it all comes down to us
this is the last night, you'll have to be alone
i'll be standing right beside you, you can't make it on your own
so walk with me, please, help me to be strong
i'll be the shoulder you can lean on, when everybody's gone
this is the last night, you'll have to be alone
i know, you, heard it all before
there's nothing worst than living less
when you yearn for something more
makes no sense, its hard to understand
when there's something that should fill you up
keeps slipping through your hands
we're all looking for answers
we're all down here on our knees
all anybody really wants, is something to believe
enough is enough, i can't take any more
but i'm standing on your front porch
kicking down your door
this is the last night
this is the last night"
"the more things change they more the stay the same
the more things change they more the stay the same
ah, is it just me or does anybody see
the new improved tomorrow isn't what it used to be
yesterday keeps comin' 'round, it's just reality
it's the same damn song with a different melody
the market keeps on crashin'
tattered jeans are back in fashion
'stead of records, now it's mp3s
i tell you one more time with feeling
even though this world is reeling
you're still you and i'm still me
i didn't mean to cause a scene
but i guess it's time to roll up our sleeves
the more things change the more they stay the same
the same sunrise, it's just another day
if you hang in long enough they say you're comin' back
just take a look, we're living proof and baby that's a fact
you know the more things change the more they stay the same
the more things change the more they stay the same
you're either runnin' round in circles or you're runnin' out of time
everybody somewhere either 12, 3, 6 or 9
the times they are a changin'
we're here to turn the page
it's the same old story but it's told a different way
the more things change the more they stay the same
the same sunrise, it's just another day
if you hang in long enough they say you're comin' back
just take a look, we're living proof and baby that's a fact
you know the more things change the more they stay the same
never and forever just keep comin' back again
don't hold out for tomorrow or hold onto yesterday
the more things change the more they stay the same
the more things change the more they stay the same
the more things change the more they stay the same
here comes a na na na na na na na
these days it's the raise the roof instead of sha la la
here come the rockers, the dancers and the remixed drum machine
this one is for the ceos and record companies
and if you're waitin' on a happy ending
we're gonna hit the hook one more time
the more things change the more they stay the same
the more things change the more they stay the same
the more things change the more they stay the same
the more things change the more they stay the same
you know the more things change the more they stay the same
the same sunrise, it's just another day
if you hang in long enough they say you're comin' back

if i, i could be anything
could i be the secret that you keep
breath that you breathe
your dreams while you sleep?
if you, if you could read my mind
then you, you'd now i crossed that line
i, i'd make you my valentine

so let's re enact that scene
from what's his name's one act play
i'll be your hero
and you'll be the one who got away
now i'm chasing headlights back home
and you, you're sitting there on your own
when we were sippin' martinis
i started believing i wouldn't be leaving alone
i told you a joke and you laughed
when i asked you to dance
you said there's no band, there's no radio
i got up real slow, started singing real low
when i was melting in your arms i had to let go

so let's re enact that scene
from what's his name's one act play
i'll be your hero

there were no yesterdays

we wouldn't let slip away

"one heart one other
they met last summer
one move she started
now they love this way
the pain of pleasure
lying together
you're at their mercy
as the telephone's ringing on
no one said there'd be nights like this
risk your life for a stolen kiss
we live , we learn, we lie
for the price of love
we kiss then say goodbye
for the price of love
each move goes so slow
until the doors close
no secret codes now
no words as baby goes down
one last dance then goodbye
practicing his love lies
he runs to his wife
and your left holding the knife
you live your life to take that chance
when you're a master of
the art of romance
and you know you won't cross
that line
until that last slow dance
we live, we learn, we lie
for the price of love
we kiss, then say goodbye
for the price of love
we live, we learn, we lie
for the price of love
alone our lonely hearts
would die.
it's all a game
and the way that it's played
there's no time to wonder why
to catch you when you fall
answer when you call
no one can hear you cry
solo
we live, we learn, we lie
for the price of love
we kiss, then say goodbye
for the price of love"
"i can see the sun goin' down
i still see the cars roll by
i can see that seaside pool
where we spent those summer nights
and i can hear the moonlit ocean
and i can feel your hand in mine
i can taste the warm free ocean
what a vision in my mind
and i, i lie in waiting
and i'm anticipating the promise, the promise
i remember what you told me
we both sounded so sincere
you said you'd always be my baby
and i said baby i'll always be there
well i remember our first time girl
i still see the beach that night
i remember we were scared girl
but we both know that it felt so right
time can never change it
and i'll never break it
the promise, the promise
was made for nights like this
seal it with your kiss
the promise, with the promise
now the summer sun is gone
for the young ones who are left to carry on
the promise, the promise"
"album: 100,000,000 bon jovi fans can't be wrong
i got something on my mind; i’m just a little bit depressed
i try to blame it on the rain but it was in my heart, i guess
i’m feeling like a stranger when i drove through my hometown
past the sign that reads ‘the boyhood home of a place that’s long gone now’
i realized ain’t nothing what it used to be
until i heard a song that takes me to my memories
chorus:
radio saved my life tonight
an old song that that dj played made me feel alright
i made it home by my dashboard light
the radio saved my life tonight
just this side of morning, just this side of dawn
i walked so soft into my bedroom, saw my wife sleeping alone
she whispered, “baby, are you ok? have you been gone for long?”
i just kicked off my jeans and i held her close, i held her all night long
i tried to sleep but in my mind i heard that song
like a friend in need the melody keeps me hanging on
chorus:
radio saved my life tonight
an old song that that dj played made me feel alright
i made it home by my dashboard light
radio saved my life tonight
chorus:
the radio saved my life tonight
the sad song that the dj played made me feel alright
as i drove down that lonesome highway just me and my dashboard light
radio saved my life tonight
radio saved my life tonight
that old song that the dj played made me feel alright
i made it home by my dashboard light
radio saved my life tonight
the radio saved my life tonight
the radio saved my life tonight
the radio saved my life tonight
the radio saved my life tonight"

trying to walk to my own beat
another car out on the street
trying to find the highway

this is the story of my life
and i write it everyday
i know it isn't black and white
and it's anything but gray
i know that no, i'm not alright

in the desert on god's floor
close your eyes, stop counting sheep
you ain't in boot camp anymore

men and women side by side
thought we'd be met as liberators
in a thousand year old fight
i got this painful ringing in my ear
from an ied last night
but no lead lined humvee war machine
could save my sergeant's life
three more soldiers, six civilians
need these words to come out right

save your children from this life
hear these words, this humble plea
for i, have seen the suffering
and with this prayer, i'm hopin'
that we can be unbroken
it's eighteen months now, i've been stateside
with this medal on my chest
but there are things i can't remember
and there are things i won't forget
i lie awake at night
with dreams the devil shouldn't see
i wanna scream, but i can't breathe
and christ, i'm sweatin' through these sheets
where's my brothers? where's my country?
where's my ""how things used to be""?
god of mercy, god of light
save your children from this life
hear these words, this humble plea
for i, have seen the suffering

that we can be unbroken

than the medication would
there ain't no angel that's comin' to save me
but even if they could
today, twenty two will die from suicide
just like yesterday, they're gone
i live my life for each tomorrow
so their memories will live on
once we were boys and we were strangers
now we're brothers and we're men
someday, you'll ask me, ""was it worth it
to be of service in the end? ""
well, the blessing and the curses
yeah, i'd do it all again

you taught me a couple of things that i didn't know

a rich man or a poor man, a pawn or a king
you can live on the street, you can rule the whole
world
but you don't mean one damn thing
what do you got if you ain't got love
whatever you got it just ain't enough
you're walkin' the road but you're goin' nowhere
you're tryin' to find your way home but there's no
one there
who do you hold in the dark of night
you wanna give up but it's worth the fight
you have all the things that you've been dreamin' of
if you ain't got someone, you're afraid to lose
everybody needs just one, someone... to tell them the
truth
maybe i'm a dreamer, but i still believe
i believe in hope, i believe the change can get us
off of our knees
if you ain't got love, it's all just keeping score
if you ain't got love, what the hell we doing it for?
i don't wanna have to talk about it,
how many songs you gotta sing about it
how long you gonna live without it
why does someone somewhere have to doubt it,
someday you'll figure it out
if you ain't got love it's all just keeping score
if you ain't got love what the hell we doin' it for?
woahhh, what do you got it if you ain't got love
woahhh, what do you got if you ain't got love
woahhh, what do you got it if you ain't got love"

we were finding our own way
there is no wind, there is no rain
in the eye of the hurricane
every time you climb that mountain
there's another one left to climb
don't go looking for tomorrow
leaving yesterday behind
writing every page together
those days were not to last forever
diamonds in the rough
when we were us
burn the house and torch the skyline
there was more than fire in my eyes
love meant more than lust
when we were us
we were one, born and raised
more than blood runs through these veins
cuts can heal, scars will fade
what we had will never change
seasons pass and time will move on
you don't ever have to let it go
you can go only so far now
till your on your way back home
writing every page together
those days were not to last forever
diamonds in the rough
when we were us
burn the house and torch the skyline
there was more than fire in my eyes
love meant more than lust
when we were us
memories are nothing more than ghost that we let in
don't be afraid of them, do you remember when
writing every page together
those days were not to last forever
diamonds in the rough

i was looking for something i couldn't replace
i was running away from the only thing i've ever known
like a blind dog without a bone
i was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
i hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
i been there, done that
but i ain't looking back on the seeds i've sown
saving dimes spending too much time on the telephone
who says you can't go home
who says you can't go home
there's only one place they call me one of their own
just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
who says you can't go home
who says you can't go back
i been all around the world and as a matter of fact
there's only one place left i want to go
who says you can't go home
it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
i went as far as i could, i tried to find a new face
there isn't one of these lines that i would erase
i lived a million miles of memories on that road
with every step i take i know that i'm not alone
you take the home from the boy
but not the boy from his home
these are my streets, the only life i've ever known
who says you can't go home

feels like i never left, that's how the story goes

the guests all disappeared
you dropped in with a group of friends
i didn't notice they were there
was it the way your fingers held that glass
the way your lips broke when you left
i don't care if the devil is keeping score
for just one look i'd crawl across the floor
who would you die for
who would you die for
will you write me lipstick letters
and miss me when i am gone
wake up tangled in the sheets
still aching for my arms
the way you move it's almost holy
hoping you don't know you own me
all i want is all of you and more
the big bad wolf is knocking at your door
who would you die for, who would you die for
i wanna know, your secrets and your sins,
i wanna feel you breatheing out and in
i wanna know, i wanna know
who would you die for, who would you die for
i wanna know what makes you feel, i wanna know love truly is

knocked me on my ass to the floor

i saw your car parked outside motel cascade
saw two shadows go to town on the shade
i can’t believe my own lyin’ eyes, oh my
it better be your girlfriend i saw going down some other guy
you told me you loved me, ‘til death do us part
so tell me there’s a tombstone where there used to be a heart

you said you couldn’t live without me
so why aren’t you dead?
instead of six feet under you’re in someone else’s bed
there’s just one thing that i can’t get through my head
you said you couldn’t live without me so why aren’t you dead?
i cut your face out of our old photographs
and all the junk you left behind’s in the trash
well, i hoped you were a goner for sure
well, there’s been a resurrection, yeah, a miracle cure
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
if you can’t trust the livin’ baby who can you trust?

where sometimes you talk so tough
that your feet don't touch the ground

while the old men recite their story lines
about when i was young like you
they say: oh yeah
we were cruising to the backbeat
oh yeah, making love in the backseats
we were wild, wild in the streets
wild, wild in the streets
a member of the boy's brigade
had a date with the girl next door
you know it made her daddy crazy
but it only made her want him more
they weren't looking for trouble
you know that boy didn't want a fight not tonight
so she headed out through her bathroom window
what her daddy didn't know was gonna be alright

cold is the night without your love

that blows through my heart
wild is the wind,
wild is the wind
you got to understand, baby
wild is the wind
you need someone to hold you
somebody to be there night and day
someone to kiss your fears away
i just went on pretending
too weak, too proud, too tough to say
i couldn't be the one
to make your dreams come true
that's why i had to run
though i needed you, baby

that takes me away from you
cold is the night without your love
to see me through, baby

maybe a better man
would live and die for you
baby, a better man would
never say goodbye to you

get out of my way
i bend but i aint' breaking
scared but i ain't shaking
baby, you can sleep while i dream
 this one's for the breathing
 forgotten and the bleeding
i may whisper but i'm screaming
i got angels, i got demons
baby, you can sleep while i dream
i'm not suggesting that you fly with me well here's a dose of some reality you're swinging at a change up, boy you better shape
up, here comes the wrecking
ball
good morning, here's your wake up call
chorus:
 i feel the change a comin'
 see that train a comin'
 this one's for the dreamers
 doubting disbelievers
get out of my way
i bend but i ain't breaking
i'm scared but i ain't shaking
baby, you can sleep while i dream
 this one's for the breathing
 the dying and the bleeding
get out of my way
i may whisper but i'm screaming
i got angels, i got demons
baby, you can sleep while i dream, when i dream? and i
dream? i dream?
 i can feel the change a come
 i see that train a coming
can you see it?"
"you can lose at cards
you can lose your keys
you can lose the house or lose the lease
you can lose your car, you can lose the race
you can lose your mind or lose your faith
take a look around and hear what i've gotta say
you can't lose at love
no, you can't lose at love
you can't lose at love
you can't lose at love
chose anything you can dream of
no, you can't lose at love
we could lose the plot
or we could lose our way
but i ain't going to lose
these ain't good games we're playing
let me make you an offer too good to refuse
no, you can't lose at love
no, you can't lose at love
you can't lose at love
you can't lose at love
chose anything you can dream of
but you can't lose at love
now we just might roll a seven, these ain't loaded dice
we'll never get to heaven from this driveway tonight
you've heard a million promises that's never come through
baby i'm telling you we're due
you can't lose at love
you can't lose at love
chose anything you can dream of
but baby, you can't lose at love
take a chance on me
cause you can't lose at love
take a chance on me
no, you can't lose at love
take a chance on me
you can't lose at love
no, you can't lose at love
you can't lose at love
you can't lose
you can't lose"
"at the mirror you fix your hair and put your makeup on
you're insecure about what clothes to wear
i can't see nothing wrong
to me you look so beautiful when you can't make up your mind
it's half past eight, it's getting late
it's ok, take your time
standing here my hands in my pockets
like i have a thousand times
thinking back it took one breath
one word to change my life
chorus: the first time i saw you it felt like coming home
if i never told you i just want you to know
you had me from hello
when we walk into a crowded room it's like we're all alone
everybody tries to kidnap your attention
you just smile and steal the show
you come to me and take my hand
we start dancin' slow
you put your lips up to my ear and whisper way down low
chorus: from the first time i saw you it felt like coming home
if i never told you i just want you to know
you had me from hello
and when you're laying down beside me
i feel your heartbeat to remind me...
chorus: the first time i saw you it felt like coming home
if i never told you i just want you to know
you had me from hello
from hello
from hello"
"you're dancing with your shadow
you been talking in your sleep
well you can walk on water
but don't want to wet your feet
you really got me
you really got me now
you know i don't know how you do it
but you really put me through it
you got me
you say you talk to everyone
who is anyone in town
but they don't recognize you
with your foot out of your mouth
you really got me
you really got me now
you know i don't know how you do it
but you really put me through it
you got me
who am i to judge a man
who says he's his own biggest fan
it's true
you brought a knife out to a gunfight
and you're shouting that i'm dead
my old friends smith and wesson
think you're in over your head
you really got me
you really got me now
you know i don't know how you do it
but you really put me through it
you got me
repeat"
