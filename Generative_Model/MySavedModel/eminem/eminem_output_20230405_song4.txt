Chasing dreams and memories, they mind as much
and its all she wrote
the credit for the shrooms is all that explains at
and it's so sad to see a on girl
right because i say it still is
to be right back out
i'm still a grow of chatches
with an apper and bottle it up in the air like a bobiem
there's nothin to tell now, eat slash man
so come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city, come on and rock with me
rock city
come on the block with me
rock city
and come and rock with me

screaming for a greatest white blue out of a man about to hit the man
i'll never forget me more than a groove that boosta dirty ho
