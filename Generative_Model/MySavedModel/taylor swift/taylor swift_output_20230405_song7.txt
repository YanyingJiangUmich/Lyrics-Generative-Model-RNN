With a heart full of hope, ah
seen your closure
your closure, your closure
your closure, you're two time
i bet you got pushed around
somebody mate you pulled me
off his coat
i said hit the ground, hey ey ey ey
'cause i don't kepp the finish
like the back of my hand?
i'd make the stars that shined
in the sky, the pretty lights
and our favorite songs
finding my breath for soon you'll get better
ooh ah, you'll get better soon
'cause you have to
the way you move when you walk back again
so call your shawty and tell her that you're my man
and i know why we had to say goodbye
fight, 230 sears here
you remember it all too well
wind in my hair, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were thisking the broken heart me can you bet
i know yeah
you could hide
byen by
i was walking out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
and you know in your soul
when it's time to go
you know, you know, you'll always know me, dorothea dorothea
