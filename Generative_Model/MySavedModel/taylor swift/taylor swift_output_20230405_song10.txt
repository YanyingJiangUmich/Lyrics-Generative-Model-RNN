Where the music never stops, it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spent a long time for you
but love lasts all the my feet deat, you're better off thing rain
drive down this road till the one we're on endans
just keep on keeping you like this
i thought i had you could be the onn for the boys then that ends
but that was all baby from smiles
world me want you like it's my nembo
you're better off, you're better off without him
find yourself another

wish i don't like your perfect love
cry,ncand under and the kiddlises
on a message in a bottle is all i can do
standin' here, hopin' it gets to you you could be the one that's all to get
i wanna fight

let's go, oh, oh
now we're standing in the rain out
i see the e gless or weren't watched you back my plances
and it's how you get the girl, girl, oh
and that's how it works
it's how you get the girl, girl, oh
and that's how it works

and that's how it works
it's how you get the girl, girl, oh
