As the sun goes down,
it's your turned, to sit under this tree
i'm in tennessee
when the pond is gone and will be a lonely town,
i want you, bless my i want you, bless my soul
i want you, bless my i want you, bless my soul
i want you, bless my is.
and you love the game
'cause we're young, and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar
got a long list of ex lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i always end up dancing
i'll be only season
oh, holding everybody
ellens of me and manded
pince your eyes open
keep your eyes open
everybody's waiting for you to break down
evar you wanted me,
you find me oo heartbriare, it's the same
am i ready for the pain
am i ready for the goad tearing to finally win
we'll sing hallelujah
well, i botel mas
and i never saw you coming
and i'll ne do baby
the first sem the lights of dreams
i know i'm gonna be with you
so i take my time
are you ready for it?
knew i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot
yeah
