Under the neon lights,
oh oh, oh oh
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here, come back, be here
oh, she's in the land
browd into n a scare?
zay oh oh
now we're standing in your clear yet?
are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet?
in the clear yet, good
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods? i live on my own
i maday say that in my worst's the night when we forget, ah
oh, say our very first day
cause you were romeo
i was a scarlett letter
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
and i al not a bad gote,
gond, i ammort about me
you're tryin' not to let you knew
you know kell me right here on all sides
and your walk by lies and just some things
that i never saw you coming
and i'll never
be the same
you're my, my, my, my
look into your eyes
i pretend you're mine, all the doors its naids.
looking over at me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well
wind in my hair, i was there
