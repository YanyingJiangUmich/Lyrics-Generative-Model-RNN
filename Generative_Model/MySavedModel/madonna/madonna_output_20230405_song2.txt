On a starry night, lide and i'll be fine

there i' dance? a girl in the good
little boy say whe'll aim the beauts feel it barken and there, i got to let it go
cause i wanna be different, i wanna be on my own
i'll remember the way that you save my soul
tod in a trace
i'm talkion, bir ad geel
too much confusion, come on a stranger
give me a social disease
i dont watch tv
i dont watch me burn
you keep your heart inside at all
lights up in the masterpiece
and i can't tell you why
it hurts so much
to be in love with the madness of ermand.

feyls your strength
perish the thought

cherish the thought
of always having you here by my side
cherish the joy
you keep bringing it into my life
cherish your strength
