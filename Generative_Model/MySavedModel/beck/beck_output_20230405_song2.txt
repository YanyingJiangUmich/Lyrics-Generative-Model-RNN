On a starry night,

black out inum atroms
i wat a drum tey back, poor backlums ard along
smatos around memories is throat

lost on down
i found a horn to tell
all all them world
she's got in the glave lond fass and likes a fitch
macomilate ever chain
every heart i'm taking the temento you

and there mult you voustoo
a bills fall in
a coulling through somathine sperickin'
down the halls
