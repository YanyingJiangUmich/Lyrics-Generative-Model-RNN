Under the neon lights, em gets she blind when i felt just like a spark thing
about home to tell about you
now the night girl spin spins yoster
music's nume you run
oh o she's the one, she's the one
through the wise, wrone on their slowllepends
for the rafe and see, girl.
all right...............
i've got a mule and her name is sal
fifteen miles on the erie canal
she's a woman to reach cart ov, bat, baby, that lander heart
i need a job, i'm out of work
i'm out of work
i'm out of work, is that shout from the crowd waiting for the others till the wind,
runnin' down the bed, his soul
list night i dreamed the skeem faces low burning down
you say those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
