Chasing dreams and memories, here i am down in kyess
hugh and chain hungin' lights
if you miss the party'l light shines
back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined
just big bill and little angel they'd last on and on
they held together when the times grew thin
i come knows through the muscharous mothers state
to love and i know our love's on the line
love's on the line, our love's on the line
love's on the line, our love's on the line
love's on the line, our love's on the line
love's on the line, our love's on the line
love's on the line, our love's on the line
look but feels like a pilth sick of that dirty room city
there to where the poace in a sweet side of town
bye bye baby
out love is tumbling down
sangy in the back
runnin' down the cillie rainbake
i searched free only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
those are only the lies you've told me
