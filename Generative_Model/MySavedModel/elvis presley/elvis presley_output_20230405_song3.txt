Through the city streets, a peacef of a flown until you're being light
a think of me if i shall reco
saxed on jinied there in the corner
we'll have us a ball
you can spare a kid and soun
better back in the city
till i hitched a run who hells my sweet heart
down by the riverside, down by the riverside,
down by the riverside, down by the riverside
down by the riverside
down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside
i'm gonna leave.
yourt life begins when you're not here
something new, there must be caught offr sight
oh i got lucky, yes i got lucky
when i found you
holy smoke
a little less conversation, a little more action please
all this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
a little more bite and a little less barg
if you should go away
this heart goods time, in that cowboy coming home
for the morning last now
lord, you can do anything
but lay off of my blue suede shoes.
well, you can get your heart to spin
on the outside looking in
moonlight the day will
but the fire of love still burn
i'll keep your picture by my pitt
