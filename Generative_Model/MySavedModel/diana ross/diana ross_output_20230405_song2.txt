On a starry night,

but i loved hat crether of mun
chisceer, can't take a holiev
and the start around us

do you think that you could walk down when you the end of term
oh teacher, you've got the time

'cause you're gonna say

i need you somebody like the birts in fur
hangin' back nothing you at firs
that you can learn to feel the pain, you and me
but someday at christmas there
where they, when the night is close
