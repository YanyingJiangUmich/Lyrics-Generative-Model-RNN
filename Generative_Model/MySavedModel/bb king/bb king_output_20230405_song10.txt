the game 'purud of for she'l people
but she stole away life and worldy talk
but then you love me a day
oh get inought as so sad
the sunrise in the ends
ore of your own
when i try to talk to me
that's why i'm standing, standing
standing, yes, i'm standing
standing on the edge of love
one on the side of the blues
come on and go out
and pay a pock thructime

every time where i'll never know instanding in the devivers
oh yes, when i'm coming, i'm coming
hold that train, conductor
please don't love me in misery
