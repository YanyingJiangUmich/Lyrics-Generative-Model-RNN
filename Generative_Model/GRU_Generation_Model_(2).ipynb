    "# RNN - GRU\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by the TensorFlow tutorial on text generation  (https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation), we decided to go with a character-based text generation model using RNN(Recurrent Neural Network). \n",
    "\n",
    "RNN is a commonly used language model due to its capability of predicting a sequence of words. These types of models are also referred to as sequence to sequence models. Usually RNN takes in a sequence of words as input, and then processes one word each time with the context of prior words in the sequence, so it can learn the dependencies among words. The tutorial is slightly different as it’s character-based. It utilizes a dataset of Shakespeare's writing, and its methodology is that given a sequence of characters from the data,  training a model to predict the next character in the sequence, instead of predicting next word. So the tokens represent individual characters rather than words, and the corpus consists of all unique characters found within the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the two models we choose are GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). They are both good at handling sequential data and capturing long-range dependencies. We wanted to compare the two models and see which one performs better under our evaluation metrics. "
